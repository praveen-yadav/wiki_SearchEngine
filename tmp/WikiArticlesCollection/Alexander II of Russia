He was also the [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] and the [[Grand Prince of Finland]]. His most important achievement was the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of serfs]] in 1861, for which he became known as '''Alexander the Liberator''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Освободитель}}, Aleksandr Osvoboditel').

==Early life==
[[File:Alexander II as a boy, attributed to George Dawe.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander II as a boy. ([[George Dawe]],1827)]]
Born in Moscow, he was the eldest son of [[Nicholas I of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Charlotte of Prussia]], daughter of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. His early life gave little indication of his ultimate potential; until the time of his accession in 1855, aged 37, few imagined that he would be known to posterity as a leader able to implement the most challenging reforms undertaken in Russia since the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]].

In the period of his life as [[heir apparent]], the intellectual atmosphere of [[Saint Petersburg]] was unfavourable to any kind of change: [[freedom of thought]] and all forms of private initiative were being suppressed vigorously. Personal and official [[censorship]] was rife; criticism of the authorities was regarded as a serious offence. Some 26 years afterward, he had the opportunity of implementing changes; he would, however, be assassinated in public by the [[Narodnaya Volya]] (People's Will) terrorist organisation.<ref>Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'' (Free Press: New York, 2005) pp. 261, 391 & 404–421.</ref>

His education as a future emperor was carried out under the supervision of the liberal romantic poet and gifted translator [[Vasily Zhukovsky]],<ref>{{cite book| title = The McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of world biography: an international reference work| url = http://books.google.com/?id=52BmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA113| year = 1973| publisher = McGraw-Hill| page = 113 }}</ref> grasping a smattering of a great many subjects and becoming familiar with the chief modern [[European languages]]. His alleged lack of interest in military affairs detected by later historians was his reflection on the results on his own family and on the effect on the whole country of the unsavoury [[Crimean War]]. Unusually for the time, the young Alexander was taken on a six-month tour of Russia, visiting 20 provinces in the country.<ref>Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: the Last Great Tsar'', p. 63.</ref>  He also visited many prominent Western European countries.<ref>Edvardx Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', pp. 65–69, 190–191 & 199–200.</ref>  As Tsarevich, Alexander became the first Romanov heir to visit Siberia.<ref>Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', p. 62.</ref>

==Reign==
Alexander II succeeded to the throne upon the death of his father in 1855. The first year of his reign was devoted to the prosecution of the [[Crimean War]] and, after the fall of [[Sevastopol]], to negotiations for peace, led by his trusted counsellor [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]]. The country had been exhausted and humiliated by the war.<ref>Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', p. 107.</ref>  Bribe-taking, theft and corruption were everywhere.<ref>Edvard, Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'' p. 107.</ref>  Encouraged by public opinion he began a period of radical reforms, including an attempt to not depend on a landed aristocracy controlling the poor, a move to developing Russia's natural resources and to reform all branches of the administration.  In 1867 he sold Alaska to the United States for $7 million (equivalent to roughly $200 million in current dollars) after recognising the great difficulty of defending it against the United Kingdom or the former British colony of Canada.

The painting depicts the moment of the coronation in which the Emperor crowns his Empress]]

After Alexander became emperor in 1855, he maintained a generally liberal course. Despite this, he was a target for numerous assassination attempts (1866, 1879, 1880). On {{OldStyleDate|13 March|1881|1 March}}, members of the [[Narodnaya Volya]] (People's Will) party killed him with a bomb. The Emperor had earlier in the day signed the [[Mikhail Loris-Melikov|Loris-Melikov]] constitution which would have created two legislative commissions made up of indirectly elected representatives, had it not been repealed by his reactionary successor [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]].<ref>{{Citation  | title = This Day in History – 13 March 1881  | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=4833  | accessdate = 11 November 2009 }}</ref>

===Emancipation of the Serfs ===
{{Main|Emancipation reform of 1861}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}

Soon after the conclusion of peace, important changes were made in legislation concerning industry and [[commerce]], and the new freedom thus afforded produced a large number of [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]]. Plans were formed for building a great network of [[railroad|railways]], partly for the purpose of developing the natural resources of the country, and partly for the purpose of increasing its power for defense and attack.

The existence of [[serfdom]] was tackled boldly, taking advantage of a petition presented by the Polish [[landed proprietor]]s of the [[Lithuania]]n provinces and, hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors), he authorized the formation of committees "for ameliorating the condition of the peasants," and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected.

This step was followed by one still more significant.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of [[European Russia]] (serfdom was rare in other parts), containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the [[Governor-General|governor-general]] of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed.

The emancipation was not merely a [[humanitarian]] question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ''[[ukase]]''. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation.

Alexander had to choose between the different measures recommended to him and decide if the serfs would become agricultural laborers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords or if the serfs would be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors.

The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom.

The architects of the emancipation manifesto were Alexander's brother [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Konstantin]], [[Yakov Rostovtsev]], and [[Nikolay Milyutin]].

On 3 March 1861, 6 years after his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.

===Other Reforms ===
In response to the overwhelming defeat (1856) suffered by Russia in the [[Crimean War]], and to an awareness of military advances implemented in other European countries, the Russian government reorganized the [[army]] and [[navy]] and re-armed them. The changes included universal military conscription, introduced on 1 January 1874.<ref>Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'' p. 150.</ref>  Now sons of all the "estates", rich and poor, had to serve in the military.<ref>Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', p. 150.</ref>  Other military reforms involved setting up an army reserve and the military district system (still in use a century later), the building of strategic railways, and an emphasis on the military education of the officer corps. Corporal punishment in the military and branding of soldiers as punishment were banned.<ref>Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', pp. 150–151.</ref>

A new judicial administration (1864), based on the French model, introduced security of tenure.<ref>An Introduction to Russian History (1976), edited by Robert Auty and Dimitri Obolensky, chapter by John Keep, page 238</ref> A new [[penal code]] and [[judicial reform of Alexander II|a greatly simplified system of civil and criminal procedure]] also came into operation. Reorganisation of Judiciary, to include trial in open court, with judges appointed for life, a jury system and the creation of justices of the peace to deal with minor offences at local level.

Alexander's bureaucracy instituted an elaborate scheme of local self-government ([[zemstvo]]) for the rural districts (1864) and the large towns (1870), with elective assemblies possessing a restricted right of [[taxation]], and a new rural and municipal [[police]] under the direction of the [[MVD (Russia)|Minister of the Interior]].

===Suppression of separatist movements===
At the beginning of his reign, Alexander expressed the famous statement "No dreams" addressed to the Poles who inhabited [[Congress Poland]], Western [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Livonia]] and [[Belarus]]. The result was the [[January Uprising]] of 1863–1864 that was suppressed after eighteen months of fighting.

Hundreds of Poles were executed, and thousands were deported to [[Siberia]]. The price for suppression was Russian support for the [[unification of Germany]]. Years later, Germany and Russia became enemies.

All territories of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] were excluded from liberal policies introduced by Alexander. The [[martial law]] in Lithuania, introduced in 1863, lasted for the next 40 years. Native languages, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] were completely banned from printed texts, the [[Ems Ukase]] being an example. The [[Polish language]] was banned in both oral and written form from all provinces except [[Congress Poland]], where it was allowed in private conversations only.

===Encouraging Finnish nationalism===
[[File:Alexander II (Romanov) monument in Helsinki, Finland.jpg|thumb|left|240px|<center>The monument to Alexander II "The Liberator" at the [[Helsinki Senate Square#Statue of Alexander II|Senate Square]] in Helsinki was erected in 1894, 13 years after the assassination of Alexander II. At the time, Finland was still a Russian grand duchy. The date "1863" refers to the reopening of the [[Diet of Finland]]. This monument, expressing the Finns' gratitude to this Emperor, survived unharmed through many later periods of tension and war with Russia under various of its later regimes.]]

In 1863, Alexander II re-convened the [[Diet of Finland]] and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy from Russia including establishment of its own [[currency]], the ''[[markka]]''. Liberation of business led to increased [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and industrial development. Finland also got its first [[History of rail transport in Finland|railways]], separately established under Finnish administration.

Finally, the elevation of [[Finnish language|Finnish]] from a language of the common people to a [[national language]] equal to [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as "The Good Tsar" in Finland.

These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia. They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western-oriented population during the [[Crimean War]] and during the [[January Uprising|Polish uprising]]. Encouraging Finnish [[nationalism]] and language can also be seen as an attempt to dilute ties with Sweden.

===Rule during the Caucasian War===
It was during Alexander II's rule that the [[Caucasian War]] reached its climax. Just before the conclusion of the war with a victory on Russia's side, the Russian Army, under the emperor's order, sought to eliminate the [[Adyghe people|mountaineers]] in what would be often referred to as "cleansing" in several historic dialogues.<ref>Y. Abramov,[http://www.circassianworld.com/RU/CaucasianMountaineers.html ''Caucasian Mountaineers, Materials For the History of Circassian People''], 1990</ref><ref>Justin McCarthy, ''Death and Exile, the Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims'', 1821–1922, Princeton, NJ, 1995</ref>

===Liberation of Bulgaria===
In April 1876 the Bulgarian population on the Balkans rebelled against Ottoman rule. The [[April Uprising]] was suppressed brutally and drowned in blood, causing a general outcry throughout Europe. Some of the most prominent intellectuals and politicians on the Continent, most notably [[Victor Hugo]] and [[William Gladstone]], sought to raise awareness about the atrocities of the Turks imposed on the Bulgarian population. To solve this new crisis in the "Eastern question" a special conference was convened in Constantinople at the end of the year. The participants in the Conference failed to reach a final agreement.
After the failure of the Constantinople Conference, in the beginning of 1877 Emperor Alexander II started diplomatic preparation with the other Great Powers to secure their neutrality in case there would be war between Russia and the Ottomans. Alexander II considered such agreements paramount to evade the possibility of putting his country in a second disaster, similar to the Crimean War.
The Russian Emperor was successful in his diplomatic endeavor. Having secured the non-involvement from the part of the other Great Powers, on 17 April 1877 Russia declared war upon the Ottoman Empire. The Russians were successful and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877-1878 ended with the signing of the preliminary peace [[Treaty of San Stefano]] on 19 February (3 March new style) 1878. The treaty and the subsequent [[Congress of Berlin]] secured the emergence of an independent Bulgarian state for the first time since 1396, and the tsar's nephew, [[Alexander of Battenberg|Prince Alexander of Battenberg]], was elected as the Bulgarians' first ruler.
For his social reforms in Russia and his role in the liberation of Bulgaria, Alexander II became known in Bulgaria as the "Tsar-Liberator of Russians and Bulgarians".
A monument of Alexander II was erected in 1907 in Sofia at "National Assembly" square, opposite to the building of the Parliament. The monument underwent full maintenance reconstruction in 2012, funded by the Sofia Municipality and some Russian foundations. The inscription on the monument reads in Old-Bulgarian style: "To the Tsar-Liberator from grateful Bulgaria".
There is a museum dedicated to Alexander in the Bulgarian city of Pleven.

===Assassination attempts===
In 1866, there was an attempt on the emperor's life in [[St. Petersburg]] by [[Dmitry Karakozov]]. To commemorate his narrow escape from death (which he himself referred to only as "the event of 4 April 1866"), a number of churches and chapels were built in many Russian cities. [[Viktor Hartmann]], a Russian architect, even sketched a design of a monumental gate (which was never built) to commemorate the event. [[Modest Mussorgsky]] later wrote his ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]''; the last movement of which, "The Great Gate of Kiev", is based on Hartmann's sketches.

During the [[International Exposition (1867)|1867 World Fair]] Polish immigrant [[Antoni Berezowski]] attacked the carriage with Alexander, his two sons and [[Napoleon III]]. His self-modified, double-barreled pistol misfired and only a horse of an escorting cavalryman was hit.

On the morning of 20 April 1879, Alexander  was briskly walking towards the Square of the Guards Staff and faced [[Alexander Soloviev (Revolutionary)|Alexander Soloviev]], a 33-year-old former student. Having seen a menacing revolver in his hands, the Emperor fled in a zigzag pattern. Soloviev fired five times but missed. He was hanged on 28 May, after being sentenced to death.

The student acted on his own, but other revolutionaries were keen to murder Alexander. In December 1879, the [[Narodnaya Volya]] (People's Will), a radical revolutionary group which hoped to ignite a [[social revolution]], organised an explosion on the railway from [[Livadiya, Ukraine|Livadia]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} to Moscow, but they missed the emperor's train.

On the evening of 5 February 1880 [[Stephan Khalturin]], also from Narodnaya Volya, set off a charge under the dining room of the [[Winter Palace]], right in the resting room of the guards a storey below, killing 11 people and wounding 30 others. However, dinner was delayed by the late arrival of the tsar's nephew, the Prince of Bulgaria, so the tsar and his family were not in the dining room at the time of the explosion and were unharmed. 

===Family Life ===
By his empress consort, [[Marie Alexandrovna, Tsarina of Russia|Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna]], Alexander II had eight children, seven of whom survived into adulthood. He particularly put his hope in his eldest son, [[Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich of Russia|Tsarevich Nicholas]]. In 1864, Alexander II found Nicholas a bride, [[Dagmar of Denmark (Maria Feodorovna)|Princess Dagmar of Denmark]], second daughter of [[King Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]] of Denmark and younger sister to [[Queen Alexandra|Alexandra, Princess of Wales]] and [[King George I of Greece]]. However, in 1865, during the engagement, Nicholas died and the tsar's younger brother, [[Alexander III of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander]], not only inherited his brother's position of tsarevich, but also his fiancee and the couple married in November 1866, with Dagmar converting to Orthodoxy and taking the name Maria Feodorovna. In time, political differences, and other disagreements, led to estrangement between the two Alexanders.<ref>Van Der Kiste, pg. 94</ref> Amongst his children, he remained particularly close with his second, and only surviving daughter, [[Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna]]. In 1873, a quarrel broke out between the courts of Queen Victoria and Alexander II, when Victoria's second son, [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Alfred]], made it known that he wished to marry the Grand Duchess. The tsar objected to the queen's request to have his daughter come to England in order to meet her,<ref>Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818-1959'' (Sutton Publishing, 2004) pg. 71</ref> and after the January 1874 wedding in St. Petersburg, the tsar insisted that his daughter be granted precedence over the Princess of Wales, which the queen rebuffed.<ref>Van Der Kiste pg. 74</ref> Later that year, after attending the engagement ceremonies of his second surviving son, [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Vladimir]], to [[Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Maria Pavlovna of Russia)|Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] in Berlin, Alexander II, with his third son, [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Alexei]], accompanying him, made a visit to England.<ref>Der Kiste, pg. 74</ref> While not a state visit, but simply a trip to see his daughter, he was nevertheless partook in receptions at Buckingham Palace and Marlborough House, inspected the artillery at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, reviewed troops at Aldershot and met both Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and leader of the opposition, [[William Gladstone]].<ref name="Van Der Kiste, pg. 75">Van Der Kiste, pg. 75</ref> Disraeli observed of the tsar that "his mien and manners are gracious and graceful, but the expression of his countenance, which I could now very closely examine, is sad. Whether it is satiety, or the loneliness of despotism, or fear of a violent death, I know not, but it was a visage of, I should think, habitual mournfulness."<ref name="Van Der Kiste, pg. 75"/>

At home, Tsarina Marie Alexandrovna was suffering from tuberculosis and was spending increasing time abroad. In 1866, Alexander II took a mistress, [[Catherine Dolgorukov|Catherine Dolgorukya]], with whom he would father three surviving children. The affair, in the face of the tsarina's declining health, served to alienate the rest of his adult children, save his son Alexei, and his daughter, who, like Alexander II's brothers, believed that the tsar was beyond criticism, from him.<ref>Van Der Kiste, pg. 67</ref> In 1880, however, following threats on Catherine's life, the tsar moved his mistress and their children into the Winter Palace, installing them in rooms directly above the apartments of his ailing wife. When Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna made a visit in May 1880, being warned that her mother was dying, she was horrified to learn of his father's mistress' living arrangements and confronted her father.<ref name="Van Der Kiste, pg. 97">Van Der Kiste, pg. 97</ref> Shocked by the loss of support from his daughter, he quietly retreated to [[Gatchina Palace]] for military reviews.<ref name="Van Der Kiste, pg. 97"/> The quarrel, however, evidently, jolted his conscience enough to lead him to return to St. Petersburg each morning to ask after his wife's health.<ref name="Van Der Kiste, pg. 97"/> The tsarina, however, had not much longer to live, dying on June 8, 1880. Less than a month later, on July 6, Alexander II and Catherine were married in a secret ceremony at [[Tsarskoe Selo]].<ref>Van Der Kiste, pgs. 97 & 98</ref> The action scandalized both his family and the court, as well as violated Orthodox custom, which required a forty-day minimum period between the death of a spouse and the remarriage of a surviving spouse, and was condemned in foreign courts.<ref name="Van Der Kiste, pg. 98">Van Der Kiste, pg. 98</ref> Alexander also bestowed on Catherine the title of Princess Yurievskaya and legitimized their children.<ref name="Van Der Kiste, pg. 98"/>

==Assassination==
[[File:AttentatmotalexanderII.jpg|thumb|right|The assassination of Alexander II. Drawing by G. Broling 1881]]

{{Main|Narodnaya Volya|Pervomartovtsi}}
After the last assassination attempt in February 1880, [[Michael Tarielovich, Count Loris-Melikov|Count Loris-Melikov]] was appointed the head of the Supreme Executive Commission and given extraordinary powers to fight the revolutionaries. Loris-Melikov's proposals called for some form of parliamentary body, and the Emperor seemed to agree; these plans were never realised.

On 13 March (1 March [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style Date]]), 1881, Alexander fell victim to an [[assassination]] plot in [[Saint Petersburg]].

As he was known to do every Sunday for many years, the emperor went to the [[Mikhailovsky Manège]] for the military [[roll call]]. He travelled both to and from the Manège in a closed carriage accompanied by five [[Cossacks]] and Frank (Franciszek) Joseph Jackowski, a Polish noble, with a sixth Cossack<ref name="Richard J Harris, Newport Beach, CA USA">{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Richard|journal=Mother's recounting of her father's experience|date=Various|year=Various}}</ref>  sitting on the coachman's left. The emperor's carriage was followed by two sleighs carrying, among others, the chief of police and the chief of the emperor's guards. The route, as always, was via the [[Catherine Canal]] and over the [[Pevchesky Bridge]].

The street was flanked by narrow sidewalks for the public. A young member of the [[Narodnaya Volya]] ("People's Will") movement, [[Nikolai Rysakov]], was carrying a small white package wrapped in a handkerchief.
<blockquote>
"After a moment's hesitation I threw the bomb. I sent it under the horses' hooves in the supposition that it would blow up under the carriage...The explosion knocked me into the fence."<ref>Radzinsky, Edvard, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Czar'',(Freepress 2005) p. 413</ref>
</blockquote>

The explosion, while killing one of the [[Cossacks]] and seriously wounding the driver and people on the sidewalk, had only damaged the [[Bulletproofing|bulletproof]] carriage, a gift from [[Napoleon III]] of France. The emperor emerged shaken but unhurt. Rysakov was captured almost immediately. Police Chief [[Dvorzhitsky]] heard Rysakov shout out to someone else in the gathering crowd. The surrounding guards and the Cossacks urged the emperor to leave the area at once rather than being shown the site of the explosion.

Nevertheless, a second young member of the Narodnaya Volya, [[Ignacy Hryniewiecki]], standing by the canal fence, raised both arms and threw something at the emperor's feet. He was alleged to have shouted, "It is too early to thank God".<ref>Robert K. Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', Dell Publishing Company, New York, p.16</ref> Dvorzhitsky was later to write:
<blockquote>
"I was deafened by the new explosion, burned, wounded and thrown to the ground. Suddenly, amid the smoke and snowy fog, I heard His Majesty's weak voice cry, 'Help!' Gathering what strength I had, I jumped up and rushed to the emperor. His Majesty was half-lying, half-sitting, leaning on his right arm. Thinking he was merely wounded heavily, I tried to lift him but the czar's legs were shattered, and the blood poured out of them. Twenty people, with wounds of varying degree, lay on the sidewalk and on the street. Some managed to stand, others to crawl, still others tried to get out from beneath bodies that had fallen on them. Through the snow, debris, and blood you could see fragments of clothing, epaulets, sabres, and bloody chunks of human flesh."<ref>Radzinsky, (2005) p. 415</ref>
</blockquote>

Later it was learned there was a third bomber in the crowd. [[Ivan Emelyanov]] stood ready, clutching a briefcase containing a bomb that would be used if the other two bombers failed.

Alexander was carried by sleigh to the [[Winter Palace]] to his study where, twenty years before almost to the day, he had signed the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|Emancipation Edict]] freeing the serfs. Alexander was bleeding to death, with his legs torn away, his stomach ripped open, and his face mutilated.<ref>Massie, p.16</ref> Members of the [[Romanov family]] came rushing to the scene.

The dying emperor was given [[Eucharist|Communion]] and [[Last_rites#In_the_Orthodox_Church|Last Rites]]. When the attending physician, [[Sergey Botkin]], was asked how long it would be, he replied, "Up to fifteen minutes."<ref>Radzinsky, (2005) p. 419</ref> At 3:30 that day the standard (Alexander's personal flag) of Alexander II was lowered for the last time.

==Aftermath==
Alexander II's death caused a great setback for the reform movement. One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or [[Duma]], which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48&nbsp;hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to [[constitutional monarchy]] instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his coronation was to tear up those plans. A [[Duma]] would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].

The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and [[police brutality]] burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose murder and subsequent death was witnessed first-hand by his son, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], and his grandson, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish [[pogrom]]s and [[May Laws|legislation]] were yet another result.

Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired [[anarchism|anarchists]] to advocate "'[[propaganda by the deed|propaganda by deed]]'—the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution."<ref>Palmer, Brian (29 December 2010) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''</ref>

With construction starting in 1883, the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory.

==Marriages and children==

</center>]]

During his bachelor days, Alexander made a state visit to England in 1838. Just a year older than the young [[Queen Victoria]], Alexander's approaches to her were indeed short-lived. Victoria married her German cousin, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert of Saxe-Coburg]] in February 1840. On 16 April 1841, aged 23, Tsarevitch Alexander married [[Marie of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Marie of Hesse]] in St Petersburg, thereafter known in Russia as [[Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Maria Alexandrovna]].

(Marie was the legal daughter of [[Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse|Ludwig II, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine]] and [[Wilhelmina of Baden|Princess Wilhelmina of Baden]], although some gossiping questioned whether the Grand Duke Ludwig or Wilhelmina's lover, [[August von Senarclens de Grancy|Baron August von Senarclens de Grancy]], was her biological father.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Alexander was aware of the question of her [[Paternity (law)|paternity]].)

The marriage produced six sons and two daughters:

Alexander had many mistresses during his marriage and fathered seven known illegitimate children{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. These included:
* Charlotte Henriette Sophie Jansen (15 November 1844 – July 1915) with mistress Sophie Charlotte Dorothea Von Behse (1828–1886){{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* Joseph Raboxicz{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* Michael-Bogdan Oginski (10 October 1848 – 25 March 1909) with mistress Countess Olga Kalinovskya (1818–1854){{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* Antoinette Bayer (20 June 1856 – 24 January 1948) with his mistress Wilhelmine Bayer{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

On 6 July 1880, less than a month after Empress Maria's death, Alexander formed a [[morganatic marriage]] with his mistress Princess [[Catherine Dolgorukov]], with whom he already had four children:
* [[Prince George Alexandrovich Yurievsky|George Alexandrovich Romanov Yurievsky]] (12 May 1872 – 13 September 1913). Married Countess Alexandra Zarnekau and had issue. They later divorced.
* Olga Alexandrovna Yurievskaya (7 November 1874 – 10 August 1925). Married Count Georg Nikolaus of Nassau, [[Count of Merenberg]].
* Boris Alexandrovich Yurievsky (23 February 1876 – 11 April 1876).

==Alexander II's dog, Milord==
A favourite dog of Alexander II was an [[Irish Setter]] named Milord.<ref name="irish">Charcot, Gennadi, "[http://www.irishredsetterclub.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85:irish-red-setter-in-russia&catid=42:red-setters-abroad&Itemid=66 Irish Red Setter In Russia]", [http://www.irishredsetterclub.com/home/index.php Irish Red Setter Club], St. Petersburg, 2009</ref>
Contemporaries wrote that Milord was a Black Setter, but now it is understood to have been a [[Red Setter]] with black color on the tips of its hair – which gave the dog a black color with a red nuance.<ref name=irish/>

Milord was given to emperor Alexander by a Polish landowner, and was said not to be [[Purebred (dog)|pure bred]]. Evidently that fact did not upset Alexander, as it was said that he never parted from the dog – not even for a second.<ref name=irish/>

Many citizens of Saint Petersburg came to know the figure of the emperor – a tall stately man, who frequently walked with his Setter along the lattice of the [[Summer Garden]]. Milord was likely the most famous animal in the Russian Empire at that time.<ref name=irish/>

The personal doctor of the emperor Alexander II supposedly also owned an Irish Setter,  and when she had a litter, one puppy was given to Russian author [[Leo Tolstoy]] – who raised the dog at his estate, [[Yasnaya Polyana]].<ref name=irish/>

==In fiction==
[[File:Alexanderbotkin.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Portrait of Alexander II]]
Alexander II appears prominently in the opening two chapters of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Michael Strogoff]]'' (published in 1876 during Alexander's own lifetime). The Emperor sets the book's plot in motion and sends its eponymous protagonist on the dangerous and vital mission which would occupy the rest of the book. Verne presents Alexander II in a highly positive light, as an enlightened yet firm monarch, dealing confidently and decisively with a rebellion. Alexander's liberalism shows in a dialogue with the chief of police, who says "There was a time, sire, when NONE returned from Siberia", to be immediately rebuked by the Emperor who answers:
"Well, whilst I live, Siberia is and shall be a country whence men CAN return." <ref>[[s:Michael Strogoff/Chapter II|Jules Verne, "Michael Strogoff", Ch. 2]]</ref>

The film [[The Magnificent Sinner]] depicts a highly fictionalized account of the Tsar's romance with the woman who became his second wife.

In ''[[The Tiger in the Well]]'', [[Philip Pullman]] refers to the assassination — though he never names Alexander — and to the pogroms that followed. The anti-Jewish attacks play an important role in the novel's plot.

[[Oscar Wilde]]'s first play ''[[Vera; or, The Nihilists]]'', written in 1880 – [[Alexander II]]'s last year –  features Russian revolutionaries who seek to assassinate a reform-minded Emperor (and who, in the play, ultimately fail in their plot). Though Wilde's fictional Emperor differs from the actual Alexander, contemporary events{{which|date=October 2011}} in Russia – as published in the British press of the time – clearly{{or|date=October 2011}} influenced Wilde.

==In nonfiction==
[[Mark Twain]] describes a short visit with Alexander II in Chapter 37 of ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'', describing him as “very tall and spare, and a determined-looking man, though a very pleasant-looking one nevertheless. It is easy to see that he is kind and affectionate. There is something very noble in his expression when his cap is off.”<ref>{{Citation
