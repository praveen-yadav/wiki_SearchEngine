"'''Advance Australia Fair'''" is the official [[national anthem]] of [[Australia]]. Created by the Scottish-born composer [[Peter Dodds McCormick]], the song was first performed in 1878, and was sung in Australia as a patriotic song. It did not gain its status as the official anthem until 1984, following a [[Australian plebiscite, 1977|plebiscite to choose the national anthem in 1977]]. Other songs and marches have been influenced by "Advance Australia Fair", such as the Australian vice-regal salute.

==History==

===Origin===
"Advance Australia Fair" was composed in the late 19th century by [[Peter Dodds McCormick]] under the pen-name "Amicus" (which means "friend" in Latin). It was first performed by [[Andrew Fairfax]] at a [[Highland Society (Australia)|Highland Society]] function in Sydney on 30 November 1878. The song quickly gained popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of around 10,000 at the inauguration of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] on 1 January 1901. In 1907 the Australian Government awarded McCormick £100 for his composition.

In a letter to R.B. Fuller, dated 1 August 1913, McCormick described the circumstances that inspired him to write "Advance Australia Fair":

{{quote|One night I attended a great concert in the Exhibition Building, when all the National Anthems of the world were to be sung by a large choir with band accompaniment. This was very nicely done, but I felt very aggravated that there was not one note for Australia. On the way home in a bus, I concocted the first verse of my song & when I got home I set it to music. I first wrote it in the Tonic Sol-fa notation, then transcribed it into the Old Notation, & I tried it over on an instrument next morning, & found it correct. Strange to say there has not been a note of it altered since. Some alteration has been made in the wording, but the sense is the same. It seemed to me to be like an inspiration, & I wrote the words & music with the greatest ease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000008257145|title=Letters [manuscript]|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=26 October 2008}} Letter to R.B. Fuller Esq. dated 1 August 1913</ref>}}

The earliest known sound recording of "Advance Australia Fair" appears in ''The Landing of the Australian Troops in Egypt'' (circa 1916), a short commercial recording dramatising the arrival of Australian troops in Egypt ''en route'' to Gallipoli.<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/historical/landing-of-australian-troops/clip1/ The Landing of the Australian Troops in Egypt] from National Film and Sound Archive, at australianscreen online</ref>

Before its adoption as Australia's national anthem, "Advance Australia Fair" had considerable use elsewhere. For example, Australia's national broadcaster, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]], used it to announce its news bulletins until 1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screensound.gov.au/services/soa-media/index.html|title=Media Resources – Images and Audio files for Download|publisher=[[National Film and Sound Archive]]|accessdate=1 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071018045853/http://screensound.gov.au/services/soa-media/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 18 October 2007}} (1943 – The Majestic Fanfare by Charles Williams, the ABC radio news theme)</ref> It was also frequently played at the start or end of official functions. Towards the end of World War II it was played in picture theatres after "God Save the King" and the [[Star Spangled Banner|American national anthem]].<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/17882691 "Song and Two Anthems" ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 30 November 1943 p.4]</ref>

===Competitions, plebiscite and adoption===
In 1951 there was a competition for a new national anthem to celebrate the golden jubilee of the [[Federation of Australia]].  The entry by the Austrian-born conductor [[Henry Krips (conductor)|Henry Krips]], "This Land of Mine", won the competition but it was decided to make no change to the status quo.<ref>[http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/aaf/aaf_fact_17.html Lachlan Cranswick's Personal Homepage]</ref>

Until 1974 "[[God Save the Queen]]" was Australia's national anthem. In 1973 the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] government decided that the country needed an anthem that could represent Australia with "distinction" and started a competition to find one. The [[Australia Council for the Arts]] organised the contest, which was dubbed the "Australian National Anthem Quest". The contest was held in two stages, the first seeking lyrics and the second music, each having an [[Australian dollar|A$]]5,000 prize for the winning entry. On the recommendation of the Council for the Arts, none of the new entries were felt worthy enough, so the contest ended with the suggestions for "Advance Australia Fair", "[[Waltzing Matilda]]" and "[[Song of Australia]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/anthem.cfm#history|title=Australian National Anthem – History|publisher=Australian Government|date=10 July 2007|accessdate=1 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071109134834/http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/anthem.cfm#dvd_cd| archivedate= 9 November 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1974 the Whitlam government then performed a nationwide opinion survey to determine the song to be sung on occasions of national significance. Conducted through the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], it polled 60,000 people nationally. ''Advance Australia Fair'' was chosen and was enshrined as the national song, to be used on all occasions excepting those of a specifically regal nature. A spokesman for the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam stated that the Government regarded the tune primarily as the national anthem.

In January 1976 the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government reinstated "God Save the Queen" for royal, vice-regal, defence and [[loyal toast]] occasions as well as making plans to conduct a national poll to find a song for use on ceremonial occasions when it was desired to mark a separate Australian identity. This was conducted as a [[Australian plebiscite, 1977 (National Song)|plebiscite to choose the National Song]], held as an optional additional question in the [[Australian referendum, 1977|1977 referendum]] on various issues. "Advance Australia Fair" received 43.29% of the vote, defeating the three alternatives, "[[Waltzing Matilda]]" (28.28%), "[[Song of Australia]]" (9.65%) and the existing national anthem, "[[God Save the Queen]]" (18.78%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/elect/referend/pleb.htm|title=Plebiscite results: National Song Poll|publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]|date=30 June 2002|accessdate=13 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080205110200/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/elect/referend/pleb.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 5 February 2008}}</ref>

"Advance Australia Fair", with modified lyrics from the original (see [[#Development of lyrics|development of lyrics]]), was adopted as the Australian national anthem on 19 April 1984 by a proclamation by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/handbook/national_symbols/index.htm|title=Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia – National Symbols|publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]|date=21 September 2005|accessdate=1 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830052800/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/handbook/national_symbols/index.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 August 2007}} (proclamation by Governor-General dated 19 April 1984)</ref> on a recommendation by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of [[Bob Hawke]].

==Orchestral version==
The wordless orchestral version of "Advance Australia Fair" that is now regularly played for Australian victories at international sporting medal ceremonies, and at the openings of major domestic sporting, cultural and community events, is by [[Tommy Tycho]], an immigrant from Hungary. It was first commissioned by ABC Records in 1984 and then televised by Channel 10 in 1986 in their Australia Day Broadcast, featuring [[Julie Anthony (singer)|Julie Anthony]] as the soloist.<ref>[http://www.tommytycho.com.au/arranger.htm Tommy Tycho—Arranger]</ref>

==Development of lyrics==
Since the original lyrics were written in 1879, there have been several changes. Some of these were minor while others have significantly changed the song. The original song was four verses long. For its adoption as the national anthem, the song was cut from four verses to two. The first verse was kept largely as the 1879 original, except for the change in the first line from "'''Australia's sons''' let us rejoice" to "'''Australians all''' let us rejoice".<ref name=anthem/> The second, third and fourth verses of the original were dropped, in favour of a modified version of the new third verse which was sung at [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.mus-an6397822|title=Digital Collections – Advance Australia Fair (1901–1919)|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=3 May 2008}}</ref>

The 1901 Federation version of the third verse was originally sung as:

;Third verse

: We'll toil with hearts and hands;

: For loyal sons beyond the seas
: We've boundless plains to share;

==Criticism==
Both the lyrics and melody of the official anthem have been criticised in some quarters as being dull and unendearing to the Australian people. A [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] senator, [[Sandy Macdonald]], said in 2001 that "Advance Australia Fair" is so boring that the nation risks singing itself to sleep, with boring music and words impossible to understand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/06/22/waust22.xml|title=Call to scrap Australia's 'dull' anthem|author=Barbie Dutter|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=27 June 2001|accessdate=20 December 2007}}</ref>  A parliamentary colleague, [[Peter Slipper]], said that Australia should consider another anthem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/politics/2001/06/item20010621121726_1.htm|title=Senator reignites debate over national anthem|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|date=21 June 2001|accessdate=20 December 2007}}</ref>

Specific criticism is also directed at the fourth line of lyrics, "our home is girt by sea", both for its use of the [[Archaism|archaic]] word "[[wikt:girt|girt]]" and for being an excessively poetic way of acknowledging the unremarkable fact that Australia is an island.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Campbell|first=David|title=Time girt went down the gurgler|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=22 April 2008|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/time-girt-went-down-the-gurgler/story-e6frfifo-1111116123498|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> Criticism has come from various people, including [[Australian Labor Party]] politician [[Craig Emerson]],<ref>{{Cite news|title=Advance Australia Fair strikes a sour note|newspaper=The Australian|date=2 January 2001|url=http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,1570357%5E1683,00.html|accessdate=20 December 2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> but others, including former Labor leader [[Kim Beazley]], have defended it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alp.org.au/media/0601/kbmcact210601.html |title=Kim Beazley – Doorstop Interview (transcript)|publisher=[[Australian Labor Party]]|date=21 June 2001|accessdate=20 December 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010718044509/http://www.alp.org.au/media/0601/kbmcact210601.html|archivedate=18 July 2001}}</ref>

==Alternative Christian verse==
A Christian movement, Awakening, in the 1990s substituted an alternative second verse naming Christ and promoting Christian values.<ref name=sixth>{{cite web|url=http://www.awakening.org.au/media/2k0606lost.htm|title=Lost verse puts Christ into the National Anthem|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20001027091035/http://www.awakening.org.au/media/2k0606lost.htm|archivedate=27 October 2000|date=6 June 2000|accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref> An archived claim that the verse was sung in the 1930s at Smithton, Tasmania, is unsubstantiated and has been withdrawn from the original website. It was sung during the Global [[March for Jesus]] in 1998<ref name=sixth/> and again at [[World Youth Day 2008]] with the qualification "This is not the official verse, but a Catholic adaptation of the Australian National Anthem."<ref name="worldyouth">{{Cite web

The version was later controversially adopted by some Christian private schools for singing as a hymn at internal assemblies.<ref name=Westhiatt>Hiatt B.

The office of the Prime Minister at the time, [[Julia Gillard]], said that, under national protocols, the anthem should not be modified and alternative words should not be used.<ref name=Westhiatt/>

;Substituted verse:
: With Christ our head and cornerstone,
: We'll build our Nation's might.
: Whose way and truth and light alone
: Can guide our path aright.
: Our lives, a sacrifice of love
: Reflect our Master's care.
: With faces turned to heaven above
: Advance Australia fair.
: In joyful strains then let us sing
: Advance Australia fair!
