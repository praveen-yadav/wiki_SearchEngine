Induced abortion has a long [[history of abortion|history]] and has been performed by various methods, including herbal [[abortifacient]]s, the use of sharpened tools, [[physical trauma]], and other [[traditional medicine|traditional methods]]. Contemporary medicine utilizes medications and surgical procedures. The [[abortion law|legality]], prevalence, cultural and religious status of abortion vary substantially around the world. Its legality can depend on specific conditions, such as [[incest]], [[rape]], [[Congenital disorder|fetal defects]], a high risk of disability, socioeconomic factors or the mother's health being at risk. In many parts of the world there is prominent and divisive [[Abortion debate|public controversy]] over the moral, [[ethical aspects of abortion|ethical]], and legal issues of abortion. Those who are [[Anti-abortion movements|against abortion]] generally posit that an embryo or fetus is a human with the [[right to life]] and may equate abortion with [[homicide]], while proponents of [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]] emphasize [[reproductive rights|a woman's right to decide about matters concerning her own body]]. <!--Annotation: This paragraph covers related issues and current events.-->

Medical abortions are those induced by [[abortifacient]] pharmaceuticals. Medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of [[prostaglandin]] [[prostaglandin analogue|analog]]s in the 1970s and the [[antiprogestin|antiprogestogen]] [[mifepristone]] in the 1980s.<ref name="Kulier 2011">{{cite journal|author=Kulier R, Kapp N, Gülmezoglu AM, Hofmeyr GJ, Cheng L, Campana A|title=Medical methods for first trimester abortion|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|year=2011|issue=11|page=CD002855|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002855.pub4|pmid=22071804|volume=11}}</ref><ref name="Creinin 2009">{{cite book|author=Creinin MD, Gemzell-Danielsson K|year=2009|chapter=Medical abortion in early pregnancy|editor=Paul M, Lichtenberg ES, Borgatta L, Grimes DA, Stubblefield PG, Creinin MD (eds.)|title=Management of unintended and abnormal pregnancy: comprehensive abortion care|location=Oxford|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=111–134|isbn=1-4051-7696-2}}</ref><ref name="Kapp 2009">{{cite book|author=Kapp N, von Hertzen H|year=2009|chapter=Medical methods to induce abortion in the second trimester|editor=Paul M, Lichtenberg ES, Borgatta L, Grimes DA, Stubblefield PG, Creinin MD (eds.)|title=Management of unintended and abnormal pregnancy: comprehensive abortion care|location=Oxford|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=178–192|isbn=1-4051-7696-2}}</ref>

These techniques differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, in how early in pregnancy they can be used, and in whether cervical dilation is necessary.

MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "[[menstrual extraction]]", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. [[Dilation and curettage]] (D&C), the second most common method of surgical abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. [[Curettage]] refers to cleaning the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this procedure, also called ''sharp curettage,'' only when MVA is unavailable.<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[World Health Organization]] |chapter=Dilatation and curettage |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html |title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |location=Geneva |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-92-4-154587-7 |oclc=181845530 |accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref>

From the 15th week of gestation until approximately the 26th, other techniques must be used. [[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&E) consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction. Premature labor and delivery can be induced with [[prostaglandin]]; this can be coupled with injecting the [[amniotic fluid]] with hypertonic solutions containing [[saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[urea]]. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can also be induced by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called "[[partial-birth abortion]]," which has been [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|federally banned]] in the United States.

In the third trimester of pregnancy, abortion may be performed by IDX as described above, induction of labor, or by hysterotomy. [[Hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]] and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.<ref name="encarta">{{cite encyclopedia |last=McGee |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn McGee |coauthors=[[Jon F.

First-trimester procedures can generally be performed using [[local anesthesia]], while second-trimester methods may require [[Sedation#Levels of sedation|deep sedation]] or [[general anesthesia]].<ref name="NEJMDec2011" />

===Other methods===
Historically, a number of herbs reputed to possess [[abortifacient]] properties have been used in [[folk medicine]]: [[tansy]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[black cohosh]], and the now-extinct [[silphium]] (see [[Abortion#History|history of abortion]]).<ref name="riddle2">{{Cite book|first=John M. |last=Riddle |title=Eve's herbs: a history of contraception and abortion in the West |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=978-0-674-27024-4 |oclc=36126503}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref> The use of herbs in such a manner can cause serious—even lethal—side effects, such as [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]], and is not recommended by [[physician]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ciganda C, Laborde A |title=Herbal infusions used for induced abortion |journal=J.

Abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen.

Reported methods of unsafe, [[self-induced abortion]] include misuse of [[misoprostol]], and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus. These methods are rarely seen in developed countries where surgical abortion is legal and available.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Thapa |first1=S.

Women seeking to terminate their pregnancies sometimes resort to unsafe methods, particularly when access to legal abortion is restricted. They may attempt to [[self-induced abortion|self-abort]] or rely on another person who does not have proper medical training or access to proper facilities.

==Incidence==
There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion:
* Abortion rate – number of abortions per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age
* Abortion percentage – number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (pregnancies include live births, abortions and miscarriages)

The number of abortions performed worldwide has remained stable in recent years, with 41.6&nbsp;million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8&nbsp;million having been performed in 2008.<ref name="Sedgh 2012" /> The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women, though it was 24 per 1000 women for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries.<ref name="Sedgh 2012" /> The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries.<ref name="Sedgh 2012" />

On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions which are performed unsafely.<ref name=IJGO10/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Shah I, Ahman E |title=Unsafe abortion: global and regional incidence, trends, consequences, and challenges |journal=[[J Obstet Gynaecol Can]] |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1149–58 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=20085681 |doi= |quote=However, a woman's chance of having an abortion is similar whether she lives in a developed or a developing region: in 2003 the rates were 26 abortions per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 in developed areas and 29 per 1000 in developing areas.

The rate of legal, induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. According to the report of employees of [[Guttmacher Institute]] it ranged from 7 per 1000 women (Germany and Switzerland) to 30 per 1000 women (Estonia) in countries with complete statistics in 2008. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (Israel, the Neatherlands and Switzerland) to 30% (Estonia) in the same group, though it might be as high as 36% in Hungary and Romania, whose statistics were deemed incomplete.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sedgh |first1=G. |last2=Singh |first2=S. |last3=Henshaw |first3=S.

The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as ''total abortion rate'' (TAR).

===Gestational age and method===

Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported that 26% of abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks' gestation, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 9.7% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6.2% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4.1% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1.4% at more than 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by "[[curettage]]" ([[Suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]], [[dilation and curettage]], [[dilation and evacuation]]), 7.7% by "[[medical abortion|medical]]" means ([[mifepristone]]), 0.4% by "[[instillation abortion|intrauterine instillation]]" (saline or [[prostaglandin]]), and 1.0% by "other" (including [[hysterotomy abortion|hysterotomy]] and [[hysterectomy]]).<ref name="cdc2003">{{Cite journal |last1=Strauss |first1=L.

==Motivation==
===Rape or incest===
The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.<ref name="guttmacher" /><ref name="bankole98"/> 
[[File:AGIAbortionReasonsBarChart.png|thumb|A bar chart depicting selected data from a 1998 [[Alan Guttmacher Institute|AGI]] [[meta-study]] on the reasons women stated for having an abortion.]] Some of the most common reasons are to postpone childbearing to a more suitable time or to focus energies and resources on existing children. Others include being unable to afford a child either in terms of the direct costs of raising a child or the loss of income while she is caring for the child, lack of support from the father, inability to afford additional children, desire to provide schooling for existing children, disruption of one's own education, relationship problems with their partner, a perception of being too young to have a child, unemployment, and not being willing to raise a child conceived as a result of [[rape]] or [[incest]], among others.<ref name="bankole98">{{Cite journal|last1=Bankole|first1=Akinrinola |last2=Singh|first2=Susheela |last3=Haas|first3=Taylor |year=1998 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2411798.html |title=Reasons Why Women Have Induced Abortions: Evidence from 27 Countries |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=117–127; 152}}</ref><ref name="finer2005">{{Cite journal |last1=Finer |first1=L.

===Population control and disability===
Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the preference for children of a specific sex, disapproval of single or early motherhood, stigmatization of people with disabilities, insufficient economic support for families, lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward [[population control]] (such as China's [[one-child policy]]). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or [[sex-selective abortion]].

An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of [[birth control|contraception]] at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using [[condom]]s and three-quarters of those using the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth-control pill]]; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/3097748 |last1=Jones |first1=R.

===Maternal and fetal health===
An additional factor is risk to maternal or fetal health, which was cited as the primary reason for abortion in over a third of cases in some countries and as a significant factor in only a single-digit percentage of abortions in other countries.<ref name="guttmacher" /><ref name="bankole98"/>

In the U.S. the Supreme Court decisions in [[Roe vs Wade]] and [[Doe vs Bolton]] "ruled that the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother. Even after the point of viability, the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman. Under the right of privacy, physicians must be free to use their 'medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.' On the same day that the Court decided Roe, it also decided Doe v. Bolton, in which the Court defined health very broadly: 'The medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age—relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health. This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment.'"<ref>George J. Annas and Sherman Elias.

====Pregnancies complicated by cancer====
<!-- Sources here are >10 years old, and should be updated with new ones -->
The rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0.02–1%, and in many cases, this leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother, or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment. This is particularly true for [[cervical cancer]], the most common type which occurs in 1 of every 2000-13000 pregnancies, for which initiation of treatment "cannot co-exist with preservation of fetal life (unless [[neoadjuvant chemotherapy]] is chosen)." Very early stage cervical cancers (I and IIa) may be treated by [[radical hysterectomy]] and pelvic [[lymph node]] dissection, [[radiation therapy]], or both, while later stages are treated by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used simultaneously. Treatment of [[breast cancer]] during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations, because [[lumpectomy]] is discouraged in favor of modified [[radical mastectomy]] unless late-term pregnancy allows follow-up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth.<ref name=Weisz>{{cite journal|url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/384.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cancer in pregnancy: maternal and fetal implications |pmid=11476351 |last1=Weisz |first1=B |last2=Schiff |first2=E |last3=Lishner |first3=M |year=2001 |volume=7  |pages=384–393 |issue=4 |journal=Hum Reprod Update}}</ref>

Exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a 7.5&ndash;17% risk of [[teratogenic]] effects on the fetus, with higher risks for multiple drug treatments. Treatment with more than 40 [[gray (unit)|Gy]] of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion. Exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester, especially 8 to 15 weeks of development, can cause [[intellectual disability]] or [[microcephaly]], and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight. Exposures above 0.005-0.025 Gy cause a dose-dependent reduction in [[IQ]].<ref name=Weisz /> It is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding, depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mayr |first1=NA |last2=Wen |first2=BC |last3=Saw |last3=CB|title=Radiation therapy during pregnancy |journal=Obstet Gynecol Clin North Am. |year=1998 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=301–21 |pmid=9629572}}</ref><ref name="pmid11237773">{{cite journal| author=Fenig E, Mishaeli M, Kalish Y, Lishner M| title=Pregnancy and radiation. |journal=Cancer Treat Rev |year=2001 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |pmid=11237773 |doi=10.1053/ctrv.2000.0193}}</ref>

The process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk.

==Society and culture==

===Abortion debate===
{{Main|Abortion debate}}
Induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate, controversy, and activism. An individual's position concerning the complex ethical, moral, philosophical, biological, and legal issues which surround abortion is often related to his or her [[value system]]. Opinions of abortion may be described as being a combination of beliefs about abortion's morality the proper extent of governmental authority in public policy; and on the rights and responsibilities of the woman seeking to have an abortion. [[Ethics in religion|Religious ethics]] also has an [[religion and abortion|influence]] on both personal opinion and the greater debate over abortion.

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion. Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. Anti-abortion groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, including complete prohibition, most often describe themselves as "pro-life" while abortion rights groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as "pro-choice". Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a human being with a [[right to life|right to live]], making abortion morally the same as murder. The latter position argues that a woman has certain [[reproductive rights]], especially the choice whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.

===Modern abortion law===
{{AbortionLawsMap|size=350px}}
{{Main|Abortion law}}
{{See also|History of abortion law debate}}

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural sensibilities continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The right to life, the right to liberty, the right to [[security of person]], and the right to [[reproductive rights|reproductive health]] are major issues of human rights that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or absence of laws controlling abortion.

In jurisdictions where abortion is legal, certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a safe, legal abortion (an abortion performed without the woman's consent is considered [[feticide]]). These requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus, often using a [[Pregnancy#Terminology|trimester]]-based system to regulate the window of legality. Some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[prenatal development|fetal development]], or require that [[minors and abortion|parents be contacted]] if their minor daughter requests an abortion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://internationalfamilyplanningperspectives.org/pubs/MandatoryCounseling.pdf|title=The Impact of State Mandatory Counseling and Waiting Period Laws on Abortion: A Literature Review|format=PDF|publisher=[[Guttmacher Institute]]|author=Theodore J.

Many restrictions are waived in emergency situations. [[China]], which has a [[one-child policy]], has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Science, Technology, and Society: An Encyclopedia |page=2 |editor1-first=Sal P. |editor1-last=Restivo |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195141931 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A8C3m8rRba4C}}</ref>

Other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely. Many, but not all, of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances. These circumstances vary based on jurisdiction, but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, the fetus' development is impaired, the woman's physical or mental well-being is endangered, or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship.<ref name="Dev98-07" /> In countries where abortion is banned entirely, such as [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors' fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies.<ref>{{cite web|title=European delegation visits Nicaragua to examine effects of abortion ban |date=26 November 2007 |publisher=Ipas |accessdate=2009-06-15 |url=http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/European_delegation_visits_Nicaragua_to_examine_effects_of_abortion_ban.aspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080417033829/http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/European_delegation_visits_Nicaragua_to_examine_effects_of_abortion_ban.aspx |archivedate=17 April 2008 |quote=More than 82 maternal deaths had been registered in Nicaragua since the change.

===Sex-selective abortion===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion}}

[[Medical ultrasonography|Sonography]] and [[amniocentesis]] allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to [[sex-selective abortion and female infanticide|sex-selective abortion]], or the termination of a fetus based on sex. The selective termination of a female fetus is most common.

Sex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in Taiwan, South Korea, India, and China.<ref>Banister, Judith.

===Anti-abortion violence===

In a number of cases, abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various forms of violence, including murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, stalking, assault, arson, and bombing.

Also murdered, in the U.S. and Australia, have been other personnel at abortion clinics, including receptionists and security guards such as James Barrett, Shannon Lowney, Lee Ann Nichols, and Robert Sanderson.  Woundings (e.g., [[Garson Romalis]]) and attempted murders have also taken place in the United States and Canada,  Hundreds of bombings, arsons, acid attacks, invasions, and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have also occurred.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Death of Dr. Gunn |newspaper=New York Times |date=12 March 1993 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/opinion/the-death-of-dr-gunn.html}}</ref><ref name="naf">{{cite web |publisher=[[National Abortion Federation]] |year=2009 |url=http://www.prochoice.org/pubs_research/publications/downloads/about_abortion/violence_stats.pdf |format=PDF |title=Incidence of Violence & Disruption Against Abortion Providers in the U.S. & Canada |accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref> Notable perpetrators of anti-abortion violence include [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], [[Scott Roeder]], [[Shelley Shannon]], and [[Paul Jennings Hill]], the first person to be executed in the United States for murdering an abortion provider.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/1999/feb/03/features11.g26 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 February 1999 |title=The bomber under siege |first=Julian |last=Borger |location=London}}</ref>

[[Legal protection of access to abortion]] has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal.  These laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction, vandalism, picketing, and other actions, or to protect patients and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.

Various options and realities of abortion have been dramatized in film. In ''[[Riding in Cars with Boys]]'' (2001) an underage woman carries her pregnancy to term as abortion is not an affordable option, moves in with the father and finds herself involved with drugs, has no opportunities, and questioning if she loves her child. In ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' (2007) a 16-year-old initially goes to have an abortion but decides to bear the child and allow a wealthy couple to adopt it. The films ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' (1987) and ''[[If These Walls Could Talk]]'' (1996) explore the availability, affordability and dangers of illegal abortions. The emotional impact of dealing with an unwanted pregnancy alone is the focus of ''Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her'' (2000) and ''[[Circle of Friends (1995 film)|Circle of Friends]]'' (1995).

;Major OB/GYN textbooks
* The [[National Center for Health Statistics]] defines an "abortus" as "[a] fetus or embryo removed or expelled from the uterus during the first half of gestation—20 weeks or less, or in the absence of accurate dating criteria, born weighing < 500 g." They also define "birth" as "[t]he complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a fetus after 20 weeks' gestation.&nbsp;... in the absence of accurate dating criteria, fetuses weighing <500 g are usually not considered as births, but rather are termed abortuses for purposes of vital statistics." {{cite book|editor1-last=Cunningham|editor1-first=FG|editor2-last=Leveno|editor2-first=KJ|editor3-last=Bloom|editor3-first=SL|editor4-last=Hauth|editor4-first=JC|editor5-last=Rouse|editor5-first=DJ|editor6-last=Spong |editor6-first=CY|displayeditors=3|chapter=1.

;Other OB/GYN textbooks
* "Termination of pregnancy before 20 weeks' gestation calculated from date of onset of last [[menses]]. An alternative definition is delivery of a fetus with a weight of less than 500 g.

* "[Abortion] is commonly misunderstood outside medical circles. In general terms, the word 'abortion' simply means the failure of something to reach fulfilment or maturity. Medically, abortion means loss of the fetus, for any reason, before it is able to survive outside the womb. The term covers accidental or spontaneous ending, or miscarriage, of pregnancy as well as deliberate termination. The terms 'spontaneous abortion' and 'miscarriage' are synonymous and are defined as loss of the fetus before the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. This definition implies a legal perception of the age at which a fetus can survive out of the womb. With great advances in recent years in the ability to keep very premature babies alive, this definition is in need of revision." {{cite encyclopedia|title=Abortion and miscarriage|encyclopedia=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|location=London|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2000}}
