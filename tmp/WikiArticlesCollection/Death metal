'''Death metal''' is an [[extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]]. It typically employs heavily distorted guitars, [[tremolo picking]], deep [[death growl|growling]] vocals, [[double kick]] and/or [[blast beat]] drumming, minor [[Key (music)|keys]] or [[atonality]], and multiple tempo changes.

Building from the musical structure of [[thrash metal]] and [[Black metal#First wave|early black metal]], death metal emerged during the mid-1980s.<ref name="hbj">{{cite video | people = Dunn, Sam (Director) | date = August 5, 2005 | url = http://imdb.com/title/tt0478209/ | title = Metal: A Headbanger's Journey | medium = motion picture | location = Canada | publisher = Dunn, Sam}}</ref> Metal bands such as [[Slayer]],<ref>Joel McIver ''Extreme Metal'', 2000, Omnibus Press pg.14 ISBN 88-7333-005-3</ref><ref>[http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index7.jhtml The greatest metal band for Mtv]</ref> [[Kreator]],<ref>Joel McIver ''Extreme Metal'', 2000, Omnibus Press pg.100 ISBN 88-7333-005-3</ref> [[Celtic Frost]],<ref>Joel McIver ''Extreme Metal'', 2000, Omnibus Press pg.55 ISBN 88-7333-005-3</ref> and [[Venom (band)|Venom]] were very important influences to the crafting of the genre.<ref name = "hbj"/> [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]]<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5171|pure_url=yes}} Rivadavia, E.

During the same period as the dawn of Possessed, a second influential metal band was formed in Florida: [[Death (metal band)|Death]]. Death, originally called Mantas, was formed during 1983 by [[Chuck Schuldiner]], [[Kam Lee]], and [[Rick Rozz]]. In 1984 they released their first demo entitled ''Death by Metal'', followed by several more. The tapes circulated through the tape trader world, quickly establishing the band's name. With Death guitarist Schuldiner adopting vocal duties, the band made a major impact on the scene. The fast minor-key riffs and solos were complemented with fast drumming, creating a style that would catch on in tape trading circles.<ref>[http://www.emptywords.org/BAND.htm Death band page]</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Purcell |first=Natalie J. |title=Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6ZErQs5hCUQC |accessdate=June 2007 |year=2003 |publisher= McFarland & Company |isbn=0-7864-1585-1 |pages=54 |chapter=3}}</ref> Schuldiner has been attributed by Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia as being "widely recognized as the Father of Death Metal".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4050|pure_url=yes}} ''Death biography'', allmusic]</ref>

===Growing popularity===
By 1989, many bands had been signed by eager record labels wanting to cash in on the subgenre, including Florida's [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], [[Morbid Angel]] and [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Andy|title=Death metal, the sound of Tampa, won't be heard at Republican convention|url=http://news.yahoo.com/death-metal-sound-tampa-wont-heard-republican-convention-113030167.html|work=Reuters|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=August 25, 2012|date=August 25, 2012|quote=When they convene in Tampa to nominate Mitt Romney for president next week, Republicans will not hear a note from the city's most notable musical exports: death-metal bands such as Deicide and Obituary.}}</ref> This collective of death metal bands hailing from Florida are often labeled as "Florida death metal". Death metal spread to Sweden in the late 1980s, flourishing with pioneers such as [[Carnage (band)|Carnage]], [[God Macabre]], [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]], [[Dismember (band)|Dismember]] and [[Unleashed (band)|Unleashed]]. In the early 1990s, the rise of typically melodic "[[Melodic death metal|Gothenburg metal]]" was recognized, with bands such as [[Dark Tranquillity]], [[At the Gates]], and [[In Flames]]. <!-- PLEASE REFRAIN from name-dropping your favorite band; as we would all love to include our favorites, only a few examples are needed to benefit the article. --> {{listen|filename=Possessed_-_Seven_Churches_-_10_-_Death_Metal_(partial).ogg|title=Death Metal|description=Music sample of [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]]'s "Death Metal" from the album ''[[Seven Churches (album)|Seven Churches]]'' (1985).|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Following the original death metal innovators, new subgenres began by the end of the decade. British band [[Napalm Death]] became increasingly associated with death metal, in particular, on 1990s ''[[Harmony Corruption]]''. This album displays aggressive and fairly technical guitar riffing, complex rhythmics, a sophisticated growling vocal delivery by [[Mark "Barney" Greenway]], and socially aware lyrical subjects, leading to a merging with the "[[grindcore]]" subgenre. Other bands contributing significantly to this early movement include Britain's [[Bolt Thrower]] and [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], and New York's [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]].

To close the circle, Death released their fourth album ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]'' in 1991, an example of modern death metal. Death's founder Schuldiner helped push the boundaries of uncompromising speed and technical virtuosity, mixing technical and intricate rhythm guitar work with complex arrangements and emotive guitar solos.<ref>[http://www.emptywords.org Empty Words, where there are dozens of reviews along this line]</ref> Other examples are Carcass's ''[[Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious]]'', Suffocation's ''[[Effigy of the Forgotten]]'' and Entombed's ''[[Clandestine (album)|Clandestine]]'' from 1991. At this point, all the above characteristics are present: abrupt tempo and count changes, on occasion extremely fast drumming, morbid lyrics and growling vocal delivery.

[[Earache Records]], [[Relativity Records]] and [[Roadrunner Records]] became the genre's most important labels,<ref>'Death Metal Special: Dealers in Death' ''Terrorizer #151''</ref> with Earache releasing albums by Carcass, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, and Entombed, and Roadrunner releasing albums by Obituary, and [[Pestilence (band)|Pestilence]]. Although these labels had not been death metal labels, initially, they became the genre's flagship labels in the beginning of the 1990s. In addition to these, other labels formed as well, such as [[Nuclear Blast]], [[Century Media Records|Century Media]], and [[Peaceville]]. Many of these labels would go on to achieve successes in other genres of metal throughout the 1990s.

In September 1990, Death's manager [[Eric Greif]] held one of the first North American death metal festivals, ''Day of Death'', in Milwaukee suburb Waukesha, Wisconsin, and featured 26 bands including [[Autopsy (band)|Autopsy]], [[Broken Hope]], Hellwitch, Obliveon, Revenant, Viogression, [[Immolation (band)|Immolation]], [[Atheist (band)|Atheist]], and [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]].<ref>[http://www.officialatheist.com/index.php?item=biography ''Biography'', Official Atheist site]. Retrieved December 10, 2008</ref>

===Later history===
Death metal's popularity achieved its initial peak between the 1992–93 era, with some bands such as [[Morbid Angel]], [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]] enjoying mild commercial success. However, the genre as a whole never broke into the mainstream. The genre's mounting popularity may have been partly responsible for a strong rivalry between [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal]] and [[Scandinavian death metal|Swedish death metal]] scenes. [[Fenriz]] of [[Darkthrone]] has noted that Norwegian black metal musicians were "fed up with the whole death metal scene" at the time.<ref name="billzebub">Zebub, Bill (2007). ''Black Metal: A Documentary''.</ref> Death metal diversified in the 1990s, spawning a rich variety of subgenres which still have a large "underground" following at the present.

==Characteristics==

===Instrumentation===
The setup most frequently used within the death metal genre is two guitarists, a bass player, a vocalist and a drummer often using "hyper [[Bass drum#Double bass drum|double-bass]] [[blast beat]]s".<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=AwJJR5vvlIsC&pg=PA9&dq=+%22double-bass%22+%22blast%20beats%22 Purcell, N. ''Death Metal music: the passion and politics of a subculture''], at 9, McFarland, 2003 (Retrieved October 28, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=9--qAVrfxukC&pg=PA32&dq=%22death+metal%22+double+bass+blast+beats&hl=en&ei=XuvJTNj3Lob4sAOW_IXkDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22death%20metal%22%20double%20bass%20blast%20beats&f=false Kahn-Harris, K. ''Extreme metal: music and culture on the edge''], at 32, Berg Publishers, 2007 (Retrieved October 28, 2010)</ref> Although this is the standard setup, bands have been known to occasionally incorporate other instruments such as [[electronic keyboards]].<ref>[http://heavymetal.about.com/od/heavymetal101/p/melodicdeathmetalprofile.htm Marsicano, D. ''Melodic Death Metal''], About.com (Retrieved October 27, 2010)</ref>

The genre is often identified by fast, highly [[distortion (guitar)|distorted]] and down tuned guitars, played with techniques such as [[palm muting]] and [[tremolo picking]]. The percussion is usually aggressive and powerful.

Death metal is known for its abrupt [[death growl|growled vocals]], [[tempo]], [[Key (music)|key]], and [[time signature]] changes. Death metal may include [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] chord progressions and a varied song structure. In some circumstances, the style will incorporate melodic riffs and harmonies for effect. This incorporation of melody and harmonious playing was even further used in the creation of [[melodic death metal]]. These compositions tend to emphasize an ongoing development of themes and motifs.

===Vocals and lyrics===
Death metal vocals are referred to as [[death growl]]s; hoarse roars/snarls. Death growling is mistakenly thought to be a form of [[screaming (music)|screaming]] using the lowest vocal register known as [[vocal fry]], however vocal fry is actually a form of overtone screaming, and while growling can be performed this way by experienced vocalists who use the fry screaming technique, "true" death growling is in fact created by an altogether different technique.<ref>Interview with Samuel Deschaine, Death Metal Vocal Instructor 2011</ref>{{Specify|date=July 2011}} The three major methods of harsh vocalization used in the genre are often mistaken for each other, encompassing vocal fry screaming, ''[[Vestibular fold|false chord]]'' screaming, and "true" ''death growls''.<ref>Melissa Cross, The Zen Of Screaming</ref>{{full|date=September 2011}}
Growling is sometimes also referred to as [[Cookie Monster]] vocals, tongue-in-cheek, due to the vocal similarity to the voice of the popular ''[[Sesame Street]]'' character of the same name.<ref>{{cite web | title=Cookie Monster Vocals | work=about.com | url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/glossary/g/gl_cookiemonste.htm | accessdate=January 21, 2006}}.

''Death Metal'', ISBN 0-9582684-4-4</ref> High-pitched screaming is occasionally utilized in death metal, being heard in songs by [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]], [[Dying Fetus]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], and [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]].

The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke [[slasher film]]-stylized violence,<ref>Moynihan, Michael, and Dirik Søderlind (1998). Lords of Chaos (2nd ed.). Feral House. ISBN 0-922915-94-6, p. 27</ref> but may also extend to topics like [[Satanism]], [[religion]], [[occultism]], [[Lovecraftian horror]], [[nature]], [[mysticism]], philosophy, science fiction, and politics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Purcell |first=Natalie J. |title=Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6ZErQs5hCUQC |accessdate= June 2007 |year=2003 |publisher= McFarland & Company |isbn=0-7864-1585-1 |pages=39–42 |chapter=3}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wikihow.com/Appreciate-Death-Metal Wikihow: How to Appreciate Death Metal]</ref> Although violence may be explored in various other genres as well, death metal may elaborate on the details of extreme acts, including [[mutilation]], [[dissection]], [[torture]], [[rape]], [[cannibalism]], and [[necrophilia]]. [[Sociologist]] [[Keith Kahn-Harris]] commented this apparent glamorization of violence may be attributed to a "fascination" with the human body that all people share to some degree, a fascination which mixes desire and disgust.<ref>Khan-Harris, Keith. ''Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge''. Oxford: Berg, 2006.  ISBN 978-1-84520-399-3</ref> Heavy metal author [[Gavin Baddeley]] also stated there does seem to be a connection between "how acquainted one is with their own mortality" and "how much they crave images of death and violence" via the media.<ref>Baddeley, Gavin. ''Raising Hell!: The Book of Satan and Rock 'n' Roll''</ref> Additionally, contributing artists to the genre often defend death metal as little more than an extreme form of art and entertainment, similar to [[horror films]] in the motion picture industry.<ref name="hbj"/> This explanation has brought such musicians under fire from activists internationally, who claim that this is often lost on a large number of adolescents, who are left with the glamorization of such violence without social context or awareness of why such imagery is stimulating.<ref name="hbj"/>

According to [[Alex Webster]], bassist of Cannibal Corpse, "The gory lyrics are probably not, as much as people say, [what's keeping us] from being mainstream. Like, 'death metal would never go into the mainstream because the lyrics are too gory?' I think it's really the music, because violent entertainment is totally mainstream."<ref name="Cannibal Corpse Alex Webster">[http://www.waytooloud.com/2007/10/23/cannibal-corpse-alex-webster-and-george-%E2%80%9Ccorpsegrinder%E2%80%9D-fisher/ Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse) interview]</ref>

==Origin of the term==
The most popular theory of the subgenre's christening is [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]]'s 1984 demo, ''Death Metal''; the song from the eponymous demo would also be featured on the band's 1985 debut album, ''[[Seven Churches (album)|Seven Churches]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Purcell |first=Natalie J. |title=Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6ZErQs5hCUQC |accessdate=June 2007 |year=2003 |publisher= McFarland & Company |isbn=0-7864-1585-1 |pages=53 |chapter=4 |quote=Meanwhile, in 1983, the term was co-coined by some American teens who formed the band Possessed and labeled their demo "Death Metal".}}</ref>  Possessed vocalist/bassist Jeff Becerra said he coined the term in early 1983 for a high school English class assignment.<ref>{{cite book

==Subgenres==

It should be noted that cited examples are not necessarily exclusive to one particular style. Many bands can easily be placed in two or more of the following categories, and a band's specific categorization is often a source of contention due to personal opinion and interpretation.

*'''[[Melodic death metal]]''': [[Scandinavian death metal]] could be considered the forerunner of "melodic death metal". Melodic death metal, sometimes referred to as "melodeath", is [[traditional heavy metal]] mixed with some death metal elements. Unlike most other death metal, melodeath usually features screams instead of growls, slower tempos, much more melody and even clean vocals are heard at rare times. [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] is sometimes credited with releasing the first melodic death metal album with 1993's ''[[Heartwork]]'', although Swedish bands [[In Flames]], [[Dark Tranquillity]],<!-- PLEASE REFRAIN from name-dropping your favorite band; as we would all love to include our favorites, only a few examples are needed to benefit the article. --> and [[At the Gates]] are usually mentioned as the main pioneers of the genre and of the [[Melodic death metal#Background|Gothenburg metal]] sound.

*'''[[Technical death metal]]''': Technical death metal and "'''progressive death metal'''" are related terms that refer to bands distinguished by the complexity of their music. Common traits are dynamic song structures, uncommon time signatures, atypical rhythms and unusual harmonies and melodies. Bands described as technical death metal or progressive death metal usually fuse common death metal aesthetics with elements of [[progressive rock]], [[jazz]] or classical music. While the term technical death metal is sometimes used to describe bands that focus on speed and extremity as well as complexity, the line between progressive and technical death metal is thin. "Tech death" and "prog death", for short, are terms commonly applied to such bands as  <!-- PLEASE REFRAIN from name-dropping your favorite band; as we would all love to include our favorites, only a few examples are needed to benefit the article. -->[[Nile (band)|Nile]], [[Edge of Sanity]], and [[Opeth]]. [[Necrophagist]] and [[Spawn of Possession]] are known for a classical music-influenced death metal style. Death metal pioneers [[Death (metal band)|Death]] also refined their style in a more progressive direction in their final years. The [[Poland|Polish]] band [[Decapitated (band)|Decapitated]] gained recognition as one of Europe's primary modern technical death metal acts.<ref>{{cite web|url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p420031|pure_url=yes}}|publisher = Allmusic|title = Decapitated Biography|author = Eduardo Rivadavia|accessdate = 2010-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=134476|publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]|title = Decapitated's New Lineup Performs Live For First Time; Photos Available – Feb. 3, 2010|author = |accessdate = 2010-02-07}}</ref>

They differ from death metal in that [[guitar solo]]s are often a rarity, [[Screaming (music)|shrieked vocals]] are more prominent as the main vocal style (though death growls are still utilized and some deathgrind bands make more use of the latter vocal style), and songs are generally shorter in length, usually between one and three minutes that keep with grindcore's tradition of short time lengths in songs.

===Other fusions and subgenres===
There are other heavy metal music subgenres that have come from fusions between death metal and other non-metal genres, such as the fusion of death metal and [[jazz]]. [[Atheist (band)|Atheist]] and [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]] are two examples; the former went so far as to include jazz-style drum solos on albums, while the latter incorporated elements of [[jazz fusion]]. [[Nile (band)|Nile]] have also incorporated [[Egyptian music]] and Middle Eastern themes into their work, while [[Alchemist (band)|Alchemist]] have incorporated [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]] along with [[Aboriginal music]]. Some groups, such as [[Nightfall (band)|Nightfall]], [[Septic Flesh]], [[Fleshgod Apocalypse]], and [[Eternal Tears of Sorrow]], have incorporated keyboards and [[Symphony|symphonic]] elements, creating a [[fusion genre|fusion]] of [[symphonic metal]] and death metal, sometimes referred to as symphonic death metal.
