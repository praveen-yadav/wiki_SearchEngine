The '''bunyip''', or '''kianpraty''',<ref>E.E.Morris(1898) ''Austral English; A Dictionary of Australasian words, Phrases and Usages''. p.65-66. McMillan and Co, New York. Reprinted Gale Research Company, Book Tower, Detroit, USA, 1968.

The origin of the word ''bunyip'' has been traced to the [[Wemba-Wemba]] or Wergaia language of Aboriginal people of South-Eastern [[Australia]].<ref name=Hughes>Joan Hughes (ed.)(1989) ''Australian Words and Their Origins.'' p.90. Oxford University Press, Melbourne. ISBN 0-19-553087-X</ref><ref>Susan Butler (2009) ''The Dinkum Dictionary; The origin of Australian Words'' p.53. Text Publishing, Melbourne. ISBN 978-1-921351-98-3</ref>{{sfn|Holden|2001|p=15}} However, the bunyip appears to have formed part of traditional Aboriginal beliefs and stories throughout Australia, although its name varied according to tribal nomenclature.<ref>Bill Wannan(1970) ''Australian Folklore'', p.101. Reprinted 1976. Lansdowne Press, Melbourne. ISBN 0-7018-0088-7</ref> In his 2001 book, writer Robert Holden identified at least nine regional variations for the creature known as the bunyip across Aboriginal Australia.{{sfn|Holden|2001|p2=2-24}} Various written accounts of bunyips were made by Europeans in the early and mid-19th century, as settlement spread across the country.

== Meaning ==
The word ''bunyip'' is usually translated by Aboriginal Australians today as "devil" or "evil spirit".<ref>See for example, [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] (Kath Walker)'s story in ''Stradbroke Dreamtime.'' [http://www.nla.gov.au/exhibitions/bunyips/html-site/abor-stories/biami.html]</ref> However, this translation may not accurately represent the role of the bunyip in [[Aboriginal mythology]] or its possible origins before written accounts were made. Some modern sources allude to a linguistic connection between the bunyip and [[Bunjil]], "a mythic 'Great Man' who made the mountains and rivers and man and all the animals."<ref name=Oxford>Gwenda Davey and Graham Seal(eds)(1993) ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Folklore'', p.55-5. Oxford University Press, Melbourne ISBN 0-19-553057-8</ref> The word ''bunyip'' may not have appeared in print in English until the mid-1840s.<ref>See ''Geelong Advocate'' 2 July 1845 at Peter Ravenscroft’s ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://70.32.76.50/text/peter_ravenscroft/the_bunyip_and_inland_seal_archive_of_australia]</ref>

By the 1850s, ''bunyip'' had also become a "synonym for impostor, pretender, humbug and the like" in the broader Australian community.<ref name=Hughes /> The term ''[[bunyip aristocracy]]'' was first coined in 1853 to describe Australians aspiring to be aristocrats. In the early 1990s, it was famously used by Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] to describe members of the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia]] opposition.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1732 | title = Parliamentary decorum}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=But those names will never hurt them|first=Don|last=McGillivray|newspaper=[[Windsor Star]]|date=15 August 1994}}</ref>

The word ''bunyip'' can still be found in a number of Australian contexts, including place names such as the [[Bunyip River]] (which flows into [[Westernport Bay]] in southern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) and the town of [[Bunyip, Victoria|Bunyip]], Victoria.

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Bunyip (1935).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Bunyip'' (1935), artist unknown, from the [[National Library of Australia]] digital collections, demonstrates the variety in descriptions of the legendary creature.]]
Descriptions of bunyips vary widely. George French Angus may have collected a description of a bunyip in his account of a "water spirit" from the Moorundi people of the [[Murray River]] before 1847, stating it is "much dreaded by them… It inhabits the Murray; but…they have some difficulty describing it. Its most usual form…is said to be that of an enormous starfish."<ref>George French Angus(1847) ''Savage Life and Scenes in Australia and New Zealand''. Vol 1, p.99. London. Reprinted 1969 Libraries Board of South Australia.</ref> Robert Brough Smyth's ''Aborigines of Victoria'' of 1878 devoted ten pages to the bunyip, but concluded "in truth little is known among the blacks respecting its form, covering or habits; they appear to have been in such dread of it as to have been unable to take note of its characteristics."<ref>Smyth cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p=175}}</ref> However, common features in many 19th-century newspaper accounts include a dog-like face, dark fur, a [[horse]]-like [[tail]], [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s, and [[walrus]]-like [[tusks]] or horns or a [[duck]]-like bill.<ref>For numerous examples see Peter Ravenscroft’s survey of nineteenth century newspaper accounts of the bunyip at ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://70.32.76.50/text/peter_ravenscroft/the_bunyip_and_inland_seal_archive_of_australia]</ref>

The Challicum bunyip, an outline image of a bunyip carved by Aborigines into the bank of Fiery Creek, near [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]], Victoria, was first recorded by ''The Australasian'' newspaper in 1851. According to the report, the bunyip had been speared after killing an Aboriginal man. Antiquarian Reynell Johns claimed that until the mid-1850s, Aboriginal people made a "habit of visiting the place annually and retracing the outlines of the figure [of the bunyip] which is about 11 paces long and 4 paces in extreme breadth."<ref>Johns cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p=176}}</ref> The outline image no longer exists.{{sfn|Holden|2001|p=176}}

==Debate over origins of the bunyip==
Non-Aboriginal Australians have made various attempts to understand and explain the origins of the bunyip as a physical entity over the past 150 years.

Writing in 1933, Charles Fenner suggested that it was likely that the "actual origin of the bunyip myth lies in the fact that from time to time seals have made their way up the&nbsp;... Murray and Darling (Rivers)". He provided examples of seals found as far inland as [[Barmera, South Australia|Overland Corner]], [[Loxton, South Australia|Loxton]], and [[Conargo, New South Wales|Conargo]] and reminded readers that "the smooth fur, prominent 'apricot' eyes and the bellowing cry are characteristic of the seal."{{sfn|Fenner|1933|pp=2-6}}

Another suggestion is that the bunyip may be a [[cultural memory]] of extinct Australian marsupials such as the ''[[Diprotodon]]'', ''[[Zygomaturus]]'', ''[[Nototherium]]'' or ''[[Palorchestes]]''. This connection was first formally made by Dr George Bennett of the Australian Museum in 1871,{{sfn|Holden|2001|p=90}} but in the early 1990s, palaeontologist Pat Vickers-Rich and geologist Neil Archbold also cautiously suggested that Aboriginal legends "perhaps had stemmed from an acquaintance with prehistoric bones or even living prehistoric animals themselves&nbsp;... When confronted with the remains of some of the now extinct Australian marsupials, Aborigines would often identify them as the bunyip."<ref name=PVR>{{citation|editor1-first=Pat|editor1-last=Vikers-Rich|editor2-first=J.M.|editor2-last=Monaghan|editor3-first=R.F.|editor3-last=Baird|editor4-first=T.H.|editor4-last=Rich|year=1991|title=Vertebrate Palaeontology of Australasia|page=2|publisher=Pioneer Design Studio and Monash University|isbn=0-909674-36-1}}</ref> They also note that "legends about the'' mihirung paringmal'' of western Victorian Aborigines …may allude to the …extinct giant birds the Dromornithidae."<ref name=PVR/>

Another connection to the bunyip is the shy Australasian bittern (''[[Botaurus poiciloptilus]]'').{{sfn|Fenner|1933|p=6}} During the breeding season, the male call of this marsh-dwelling bird is a "low pitched boom";<ref>{{citation|first1=Ken|last1=Simpson|first2=Nicolas|last2=Day|first3=Peter|last3=Trusler|year=1999|title=[[Field Guide to the Birds of Australia (Simpson & Day)|Field Guide to the Birds of Australia]]|page=72|publisher=Viking Books, Australia|isbn=0-670-87918-5}}</ref> hence, it is occasionally called the "bunyip bird".<ref name=Oxford />

==Early accounts of settlers==
[[File:Story of the bunyip 1882.jpg|thumb|right|An 1882 illustration of an Aboriginal man telling the story of the bunyip to two white children]]

During the early settlement of Australia by Europeans, the notion that the bunyip was an actual unknown animal that awaited discovery became common. Early European settlers, unfamiliar with the sights and sounds of the island continent's peculiar fauna, regarded the bunyip as one more strange Australian animal and sometimes attributed unfamiliar animal calls or cries to it. It has also been suggested that 19th-century bunyip lore was reinforced by imported European memories, such as that of the Irish [[Púca]].<ref name=Oxford />

A large number of bunyip sightings occurred during the 1840s and 1850s, particularly in the southeastern colonies of [[Colony of Victoria|Victoria]], [[Colony of New South Wales|New South Wales]] and [[Colony of South Australia|South Australia]], as European settlers extended their reach. The following is not an exhaustive list of accounts:

===Hume find of 1818===
One of the earliest accounts relating to a large unknown freshwater animal was in 1818,{{sfn|Holden|2001|p=86}} when [[Hamilton Hume]] and James Meehan found some large bones at [[Lake Bathurst]] in [[New South Wales]]. They did not call the animal a bunyip, but described the remains indicating the creature as very much like a [[hippopotamus]] or [[manatee]]. The Philosophical Society of Australasia later offered to reimburse Hume for any costs incurred in recovering a specimen of the unknown animal, but for various reasons, Hume did not return to the lake.<ref>See minutes cited (19 December 1821) in Peter Ravenscroft's ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://70.32.76.50/text/peter_ravenscroft/the_bunyip_and_inland_seal_archive_of_australia]</ref>

===Wellington Caves fossils, 1830===
More significant was the discovery of fossilised bones of "some quadruped much larger than the ox or buffalo"<ref>Ranken, George cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p=86}}</ref> in the [[Wellington Caves]] in mid-1830 by bushman George Rankin and later by [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]]. Sydney's Reverend [[John Dunmore Lang]] announced the find as "convincing proof of the deluge".<ref>Lang cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p=86}}</ref> However, it was British anatomist [[Sir Richard Owen]] who identified the fossils as the gigantic marsupials ''[[Nototherium]]'' and ''[[Diprotodon]]''. At the same time, some settlers observed "all natives throughout these... districts have a tradition (of) a very large animal having at one time existed in the large creeks and rivers and by many it is said that such animals now exist."<ref>Cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p=88}}</ref> 

===First written use of the word ''bunyip'', 1845===
In July 1845, ''The [[Geelong Advertiser]]'' announced the discovery of fossils found near [[Geelong]], under the headline "Wonderful Discovery of a new Animal".<ref name="firstuse">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article94443733 |title=WONDERFUL DISCOVERY OF A NEW ANIMAL. |newspaper=Geelong Advertiser and Squatters' Advocate (Vic. : 1845 - 1847) |location=Vic. |date=2 July 1845 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> This was a continuation of a story on 'fossil remains' from the previous issue.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article91122742 |title=No Title. |newspaper=Geelong Advertiser and Squatters' Advocate (Vic. : 1845 - 1847) |location=Vic. |date=28 June 1845 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The newspaper continued, "On the bone being shown to an intelligent black (sic), he at once recognised it as belonging to the bunyip, which he declared he had seen.<ref name="firstuse"/> On being requested to make a drawing of it, he did so without hesitation." The account noted a story of an Aboriginal woman being killed by a bunyip and the "most direct evidence of all" – that of a man named Mumbowran "who showed several deep wounds on his breast made by the claws of the animal".<ref name="firstuse"/> The account provided this description of the creature:

{{quote|"The Bunyip, then, is represented as uniting the characteristics of a bird and of an alligator. It has a head resembling an emu, with a long bill, at the extremity of which is a transverse projection on each side, with serrated edges like the bone of the stingray. Its body and legs partake of the nature of the alligator. The hind legs are remarkably thick and strong, and the fore legs are much longer, but still of great strength. The extremities are furnished with long claws, but the blacks say its usual method of killing its prey is by hugging it to death. When in the water it swims like a frog, and when on shore it walks on its hind legs with its head erect, in which position it measures twelve or thirteen feet in height."<ref>''The Geelong Advertiser'' 2 July 1845 in Peter Ravenscroft's ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://70.32.76.50/text/peter_ravenscroft/the_bunyip_and_inland_seal_archive_of_australia]</ref>}}

Shortly after this account appeared, it was repeated in other Australian newspapers. However, it appears to be the first use of the word ''bunyip'' in a written publication.

===The Australian Museum's bunyip of 1847===
[[Image:Bunyip skull.jpg|thumb|The so-called bunyip skull]]

In January 1846, a peculiar skull was taken from the banks of [[Murrumbidgee River]] near [[Balranald, New South Wales|Balranald]], New South Wales. Initial reports suggested that it was the skull of something unknown to science.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article94445051 |title=PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES. |newspaper=Geelong Advertiser and Squatters' Advocate (Vic. : 1845 - 1847) |location=Vic. |date=12 January 1847 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |page=2 Edition: EVENING |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The squatter who found it remarked, "all the natives to whom it was shown called [it] a bunyip".<ref>Cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p=91}}</ref> By July 1847, several experts, including W.S. Macleay and Professor Owen, had identified the skull as the deformed foetal skull of a foal or calf.{{sfn|Holden|2001|pp=92-93}} At the same time, however, the so-called bunyip skull was put on display in the [[Australian Museum]] (Sydney) for two days. Visitors flocked to see it, and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' said that it prompted many people to speak out about their "bunyip sightings".<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/exhibitions/bunyips/html-site/evidence/skull.html] National library of Australia.

In March of that year 'a bunyip or an immense Platibus' ([[Platypus]]) was sighted 'sunning himself on the placid bosom of the Yarra, just opposite the Custom House' in [[Melbourne]]. 'Immeadiately a crowd gathered' and three men set off by boat 'to secure the stranger' who 'disappeared' when they were 'about a yard from him'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71607452 |title=PORT PHILLIP. |newspaper=[[South Australian|South Australian (Adelaide, SA : 1844 - 1851)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=2 March 1847 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

===William Buckley's account of bunyips, 1852===
Another early written account is attributed to escaped convict [[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]] in his 1852 biography of thirty years living with the [[Wathaurong]] people. His 1852 account records "in... Lake Moodewarri [now Lake Modewarre] as well as in most of the others inland...is a...very extraordinary amphibious animal, which the natives call Bunyip." Buckley's account suggests he saw such a creature on several occasions. He adds, "I could never see any part, except the back, which appeared to be covered with feathers of a dusky grey colour. It seemed to be about the size of a full grown calf... I could never learn from any of the natives that they had seen either the head or tail."<ref>Tim Flannery(Ed.)(2002): ''The Life and Adventures of William Buckley; 32 Years a wanderer amongst the Aborigines of the then unexplored country around Port Phillip, now the Province of Victoria'' by John Morgan. First published 1852. This edition, Text Publishing, Melbourne Australia. p.66. ISBN 1-877008-20-6</ref> Buckley also claimed the creature was common in the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] and cites an example he heard of an Aboriginal woman being killed by one. He emphasized the bunyip was believed to have supernatural powers.<ref>Tim Flannery(Ed.)(2002) ''The Life and Adventures of William Buckley.'' p.138-9</ref>

==In popular culture and fiction==
The word ''bunyip'' has been used in other Australian contexts, including ''The Bunyip'' newspaper as the banner of a local weekly newspaper published in the town of [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]], [[South Australia]]. First published as a pamphlet by the Gawler Humbug Society in 1863, the name was chosen because "the Bunyip is the true type of Australian Humbug!"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bunyippress.com.au/fixed/history.html | title = ''The Bunyip'' |  year=2000 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060721004112/http://www.bunyippress.com.au/fixed/history.html|archivedate=21 July 2006| work = Home Page | publisher = ''The Bunyip'', (Gawler's Weekly Newspaper) | quote = Beneath the nineteenth-century dignity of colonial Gawler ran an undercurrent of excitement.

Numerous tales of the bunyip in written literature appeared in the 19th and early 20th centuries. These included a story in [[Andrew Lang]]'s ''[[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books#Brown Fairy Book (1904)|The Brown Fairy Book]]'' (1904). ''The Bunyip of Berkeley's Creek''<ref>{{citation|title=The Bunyip of Berkeley's Creek|first=Jenny|last=Wagner|isbn= 0-14-050126-6}}</ref> is a contemporary Australian children's picture book about a bunyip.

Bunyips appear in [[Naomi Novik]]'s fantasy novel ''[[Tongues of Serpents]]''.,<ref>{{citation|first=Naomi |last=Novik|title=Tongues of Serpents|publisher= Ballantine Books|year= 2010|isbn=9780345496904}}</ref> and in the short story ''Bunyip's Gift'' in [[Mind's Eye]] by [[Jackie French]]. It also makes an appearance as the primary threat to the treasure seekers in the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] novel called [[Chander Pahar]] by [[Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay]].

In the early 1950s, [[Bertie the Bunyip]] was a popular character on Channel 3 in Philadelphia.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/bertiethebunyip.html |title= Bertie The Bunyip on Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia|author=Gerry Wilkinson|publisher= Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130731022850/http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/bertiethebunyip.html|archivedate=31 July 2013}}</ref>

The 1977 film [[Dot and the Kangaroo]] contains a song "The Bunyip (Bunyip Moon)".<ref>{{citation|url=http://sweetsoundtrack.com/Movies/dot-and-the-kangaroo-1977|publisher=Sweet Soundtrack|title=Dot and the Kangaroo (1977)|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131123063920/http://sweetsoundtrack.com/Movies/dot-and-the-kangaroo-1977|archivedate=23 November 2013}}</ref>

The Bunyip is also a [[familiar spirit|familiar]] in the [[MMORPG]] ''[[RuneScape]]''. As a reference to its origins, it speaks with a thick Australian accent.

A character named Bruce Bunyip appears in the book ''The Neddiad'' by [[Daniel Pinkwater]].  He is initially described as "big and swarthy, and had tiny eyes, a scowl and his eyebrows grew together."  Later, the character wails that his mother "says my father is a monster and I'm a monster too."<ref>{{citation|first=Daniel|last=Pinkwater|year=2009|title=The Neddiad: How Neddie Took the Train, Went to Hollywood, and Saved Civilization|publisher=HMH Books for Young Readers|format=Kindle AZW file}}</ref>

In the popular indie game [[Minecraft]], on Australian English language choice, a "creeper" is changed to a Bunyip.

In the [[Nintendo DS]] version of [[The Sims 2]], the player will sometimes have the option to buy a pet Bunyip as a special item.

In the 2011 film Toomelah, one of the main characters, Linden, sings a song about a Bunyip.
