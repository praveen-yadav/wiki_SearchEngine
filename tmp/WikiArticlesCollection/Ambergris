'''Ambergris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|b|ər|g|r|iː|s|}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|b|ər|g|r|I|s|}}, {{lang-la|Ambra grisea}}, ''Ambre gris'', ''ambergrease'' or ''grey amber'') is a solid, waxy, flammable substance of a dull grey or blackish color produced in the digestive system of [[sperm whale]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18871/ambergris |title=ambergris |date= |author= |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}</ref>

Freshly produced ambergris has a marine, [[feces|fecal]] odor.  However, as it ages, it acquires a sweet, earthy scent commonly likened to the fragrance of [[rubbing alcohol]] without the vaporous chemical astringency.<ref name="Burr">{{cite book | author=Burr, Chandler | title=The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses | year=2003 | location=New York | publisher=Random House | isbn=978-0-375-50797-7}}</ref> Although Ambergris had been highly valued by [[Perfume|perfumers]] as a fixative (allowing the scent to last much longer), it has largely been replaced by synthetics.

==Sources==
Ambergris occurs as a [[biliary]] [[secretion]] of the [[intestines]] of the [[sperm whale]] and can be found floating upon the sea, or lying on the coast. It is also sometimes found in the [[abdomen]]s of [[whale]]s. Because the beaks of [[giant squid]]s have been found embedded within lumps of ambergris, scientists have theorized that the substance is produced by the whale's gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard, sharp objects that the whale might have eaten. The sperm whale usually vomits these, but if one travels further down the gut, it will be covered in ambergris.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ChivtjDjh4</ref>

Ambergris is usually passed in the fecal matter. It is speculated that an ambergris mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth, leading to the reputation of ambergris as primarily coming from whale vomit.<ref>{{cite book |author=William F. Perrin, Bernd Wursig, J. G.M. Thewissen |title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0080919936 |page=28 }}</ref> It takes years for ambergris to form. Christopher Kemp, the author of ''Floating Gold: A Natural (and Unnatural) History of Ambergris'', says, “It is only produced by sperm whales, and only by an estimated one percent of them. Once expelled by a whale, it must float for years, then it must make landfall, avoid being broken into pieces by rough seas, and someone must find it. In other words, the odds of finding ambergris are extremely small.” The very small chance of finding ambergris and the legal ambiguity involved led perfume makers away from ambergris.

Ambergris can be found in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and on the coasts of [[South Africa]], [[Brazil]], [[Madagascar]], the [[East Indies]], [[The Maldives]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Maluku Islands|Molucca Islands]]. In rarer cases, it can be found in other locations. Most commercially collected ambergris comes from the [[Bahamas]] in the [[Caribbean]], particularly [[New Providence]].  Fossilized ambergris from 1.75 million years ago has also been found.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baldanza|first=Angela|coauthors=Roberto Bizzarri, Federico Famiani, Paolo Monaco, Roberto Pellegrino and Paola Sassi|title=Enigmatic, biogenically induced structures in Pleistocene marine deposits: A first record of fossil ambergris|journal=Geology|date=30 July 2013|doi=10.1130/G34731.1|url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2013/07/30/G34731.1}}</ref>

==Physical properties==
Ambergris is found in lumps of various shapes and sizes, weighing from 15&nbsp;g (~½&nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]) to 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;pounds) or more. When initially expelled by or removed from the whale, the fatty precursor of ambergris is pale white in color (sometimes streaked with black), soft, with a strong fecal smell. Following months to years of [[photodegradation]] and [[oxidation]] in the ocean, this precursor gradually hardens, developing a dark grey or black color, a crusty and waxy texture, and a peculiar odor that is at once sweet, earthy, marine, and animalic. Its smell has been generally described as a vastly richer and smoother version of [[isopropanol]] without its stinging harshness. In this developed condition, ambergris has a [[specific gravity]] ranging from 0.780 to 0.926. It melts at about 62 °C to a fatty, yellow resinous liquid; and at {{convert|100|C|0|abbr=on}} it is volatilized into a white vapor. It is soluble in [[diethyl ether|ether]], and in volatile and fixed oils.

==Chemical properties==
Ambergris is relatively nonreactive to [[acid]]. White crystals of a substance called [[ambrein]] can be separated from ambergris by heating raw ambergris in alcohol, then allowing the resulting solution to cool. Breakdown of the relatively scentless ambrein through oxidation results in the formation of ambrox and ambrinol, which are the main odour components of ambergris.

[[Ambroxan]], which is used widely in perfumery, is one of the many synthetics that emulate natural ambergris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://perfumeshrine.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/ambroxambroxan-modern-fascination-on.html |title=Ambrox/Ambroxan: a Modern Fascination on an Elegant Material |date=5 November 2010 |author= |publisher=Perfume Shrine |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}</ref>

==Applications==
Ambergris has been mostly known for its use in creating perfume and fragrance much like [[musk]]. Perfumes can still be found with ambergris around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/ambergris-treasure-of-the-deep-01122012.html |title=Ambergris, Treasure of the Deep |date=January 12, 2012 |first=Eric |last=Spitznagel |publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}</ref> It is collected from remains found at sea and on beaches, although its precursor originates from the [[sperm whale]], which is a vulnerable species.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/41755/0 |title=Physeter macrocephalus |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}</ref>

Ancient Egyptians burned ambergris as incense, while in modern Egypt ambergris is used for scenting cigarettes.<ref name="MatHB">{{cite book |chapter=Ambergris |title=Materials Handbook: An Encyclopedia for Managers, Technical Professionals, Purchasing and Production Managers, Technicians, and Supervisors |page=64 |last1=Brady |first1=George Stuart |last2=Clauser |first2=Henry R. |last3=Vaccari |first3=John A. |isbn=978-0-07-136076-0 |year=2002 |publisher=McGraw-Hill}}</ref> The ancient Chinese called the substance "dragon's spittle fragrance".<ref name=sciam>{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-whale-waste-is-valuable |title=Strange but True: Whale Waste Is Extremely Valuable |date=April 26, 2007 |first=Cynthia |last=Graber |publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=31 January 2013}}</ref> During the [[Black Death]] in Europe, people believed that carrying a ball of ambergris could help prevent them from getting the plague.  This was because the fragrance covered the smell of the air which was believed to be the [[Miasma theory of disease|cause of plague]].

This substance has also been used historically as a flavouring for food, and some people consider it an aphrodisiac. During the Middle Ages, Europeans used ambergris as a medication for headaches, colds, epilepsy, and other ailments.<ref name=sciam />

===Legality===
{{Main|International Whaling Commission#1986 moratorium}}
From 18th to the mid 19th century, the whaling industry prospered. By some reports, nearly 5,000 whales, including sperm whales, were killed each year. Due to studies showing the whale populations were being threatened, the International Whaling Commission instituted a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. Although ambergris is not harvested from whales, many countries also ban the trade of ambergris as part of the more general ban on the hunting and exploitation of whales.

'''Illegal'''
*United States – the possession and trade of ambergris is prohibited by the [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1973.<ref>http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/ambergris-treasure-of-the-deep-01122012.html#p2</ref>
*Australia – Under federal law, the export and import of ambergris for commercial purposes is banned by the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]].  The various States and Territories have additional laws regarding ambergris.<ref>http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/cetaceans/education/ambergris.html</ref>

==In culture==
Eggs and ambergris was reportedly King [[Charles II of England]]'s favorite dish.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] |title=[[The History of England from the Accession of James II]] |year=1848 |publisher=Harper |isbn= |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468 |volume=1 |chapter=IV |page=222 }}</ref>

In chapter 91 of Herman Melville's ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851), Stubb, one of the mates of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]],'' fools the captain of a French whaler (''Rose-bud'') into abandoning the corpse of a sperm whale found floating in the sea. His plan is to recover the corpse himself in hopes that it contains ambergris. His hope proves well founded, and the ''Pequod'''s crew recovers a valuable quantity of the substance. [[Herman Melville|Melville]] devotes the following chapter to a discussion of ambergris, with special attention to the irony that "fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale."

In the 2001 film ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'', [[Hannibal Lecter]] sends Clarice Starling a letter which he writes while intentionally wearing a hand lotion containing ambergris, correctly assuming that this would lead her to discover his location in [[Florence, Italy]], due to lotion utilizing ambergris being legal in only a few countries.

In the 2007 film [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]], the character Beadle Bamford declares ambergris to be the secret of the source of his exotic aroma.
