In [[linguistics]], a '''copula''' (plural: '''copulas''' or '''copulae''') is a word used to link the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] with a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (a [[subject complement]]), such as the word ''is'' in the sentence "The sky '''is''' blue." The word ''copula'' derives from the [[Latin]] noun for a "link" or "tie" that connects two different things.<ref>See the appendix to Moro 1997 and the references cited there for a short history of the copula.</ref>

A copula is often a [[verb]] or a verb-like word, though this is not universally the case.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pustet |first=Regina |title=Copulas: Universals in the Categorization of the Lexicon |series=Oxford studies in typology and linguistic theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-928180-7}}</ref> A verb that is a copula is sometimes called a '''copulative''' or '''copular verb'''.  In English [[primary education]] [[grammar]] courses, a copula is often called a '''linking verb'''. In other languages, copulas show more resemblances to [[pronoun]]s, as in [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Guarani language|Guarani]], or may take the form of [[suffix]]es attached to a noun, as in [[Beja language|Beja]], [[Ket language|Ket]], and [[Inuit languages]].

Most languages have one main copula (although some, like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Thai language|Thai]], have more than one, and some have none). In the case of English, this is the verb ''to be''. While the term ''copula'' is generally used to refer to such principal forms, it may also be used to refer to some other verbs with similar functions, like ''become'', ''get'', ''feel'' and ''seem'' in English (these may also be called "semi-copulas" or "pseudo-copulas").

==Grammatical function==
The principal use of a copula is to link the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a [[clause (grammar)|clause]] to the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. A copular verb is often considered to be part of the predicate, the remainder being called a [[predicative expression]]. A simple clause containing a copula is illustrated below:
::The book '''is''' on the table.
In this English sentence, the [[noun phrase]] ''the book'' is the subject, the verb ''is'' serves as the copula, and the [[prepositional phrase]] ''on the table'' is the predicative expression. The whole expression ''is on the table'' may (in some theories of grammar) be called a predicate or a [[verb phrase]].

The predicative expression accompanying the copula – also known as the [[complement (grammar)|complement]] of the copula – may take any of several possible forms: it may for example be a noun or noun phrase, an [[adjective]] or adjective phrase, a prepositional phrase (as above) or another adverb or adverbial phrase expressing time or location. Examples are given below (with the copula in bold and the predicative expression in italics):
::Mary and John '''are''' ''my friends''.
::The sky '''was''' ''blue''.
::I '''am''' ''taller than most people''.
::The birds and the beasts '''were''' ''there''.

The three components (subject, copula and predicative expression) do not necessarily appear in that order – their positioning depends on the rules for [[word order]] applicable to the language in question. In English (an [[subject-verb-object|SVO]] language) the ordering given is the normal one, although here too certain variation is possible:
*In many questions and other clauses with [[subject–auxiliary inversion]], the copula moves in front of the subject: '''''Are you''' happy?''
*In [[inverse copular constructions]] (see below) the predicative expression precedes the copula, while the subject follows it: ''In the room were three men.''

It is also possible in certain circumstances for one (or even two) of the three components to be absent:
*In [[null-subject language|null-subject]] (pro-drop) languages, the subject may be omitted, as it may from other types of sentence. For example, in Italian, ''sono stanco'' means "I am tired", literally "am tired".
*In [[non-finite clause]]s in languages such as English, the subject is often absent, as in the [[participial phrase]] ''being tired'' or the [[infinitive phrase]] ''to be tired''. The same applies to most imperative sentences, such as ''Be good!''
*For cases where no copula appears, see {{p/s|Zero copula}} below.
*Any of the three components may be omitted as a result of various general types of [[ellipsis (grammar)|ellipsis]]. In particular, in English, the predicative expression may be elided in a construction similar to [[verb phrase ellipsis]], as in short sentences like ''I am''; ''Are they?'' (where the predicative expression is understood from the previous context).

[[Inverse copular constructions]], in which the positions of the predicative expression and the subject are reversed, are found in various languages.<ref>See Everaert et al. 2006.</ref> These have been the subject of much theoretical analysis, particularly in regard to the difficulty of maintaining, in the case of such sentences, the usual division into a subject [[noun phrase]] and a predicate [[verb phrase]]. Another issue is [[agreement (linguistics)|verb agreement]] when both subject and predicative expression are noun phrases (and differ in number or person): in English the copula normally agrees with the preceding phrase, even if it is not logically the subject, as in ''the cause of the riot '''is''''' (not ''are'') ''these pictures of the wall''. Compare Italian ''la causa della rivolta '''sono''''' ("are", not ''è'' "is") ''queste foto del muro''.

==Meanings==
Predicates formed using a copula may express identity – that the two noun phrases (subject and complement) have the same [[referent]] or express an identical concept:
::I only want ''to be'' myself.
::The Morning Star ''is'' the Evening Star.
 
They may also express membership of a class, or a [[subset]] relationship:
::She ''was'' a nurse.
::Dogs ''are'' carnivorous mammals.

Similarly they may express some property, relation or position, whether permanent or temporary:
:: The trees ''are'' green.
:: I ''am'' your boss.
:: The hen ''is'' next to the cockerel.
:: The children ''are'' confused.

Other special uses of copular verbs are described in some of the following sections.

===Essence versus state===
Some languages use different copulas, or different syntax, when denoting a permanent, essential characteristic of something and when denoting a temporary state. For examples of this, see the sections below on the [[#Romance|Romance languages]], [[#Slavic|Slavic languages]] and [[#Irish|Irish]].

==Forms==
In many languages the principal copula is a [[verb]], such as English ''(to) be'', German ''sein'', French ''être'', etc. This may inflect for [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]] such as [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]], like other verbs in the language. As a very commonly used verb, it is likely that the copula will have [[irregular verb|irregular]] inflected forms; this is the case in English, where the verb ''be'' has a number of highly irregular ([[suppletion|suppletive]]) forms, and in fact has a larger number of different inflected forms than any other English verb (''am'', ''is'', ''are'', ''was'', ''were'', etc.; see [[English verbs]] for details).

Other copulas show more resemblances to [[pronoun]]s. This is the case for [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Guarani language|Guarani]], for instance. In highly [[synthetic language]]s, copulas are often [[suffix]]es, attached to a noun, that may still behave otherwise like ordinary verbs, for example ''-u-'' in [[Inuit languages]]. In some other languages, such as [[Beja language|Beja]] and [[Ket language|Ket]], the copula takes the form of suffixes that attach to a noun but are distinct from the [[grammatical conjugation|person agreement markers]] used on [[predicative verb]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stassen |first=Leon |year=1997 |title=Intransitive Predication |series=Oxford studies in typology and linguistic theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=39 |isbn=978-0-19-925893-2}}</ref> This phenomenon is known as ''[[nonverbal person agreement]]'' (or ''nonverbal subject agreement'') and the relevant markers are always established as deriving from [[clitic]]ized independent pronouns.

For cases where the copula is omitted or takes [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] form, see {{p/s|Zero copula}} below.

==Additional uses of copular verbs==
A copular verb may also have other uses supplementary to or distinct from its uses as a copula.

===As auxiliary verbs===
The English copular verb ''be'' can be used as an [[English auxiliaries|auxiliary verb]], expressing [[passive voice]] (together with the [[past participle]]) or expressing [[progressive aspect]] (together with the [[present participle]]). For example:
::The man '''was''' killed. (passive)
::It '''is''' raining. (progressive)
Other languages' copulas also have uses as auxiliaries. For example, French ''être'' can be used to express passive voice similarly to English ''be'', and both French ''être'' and German ''sein'' are used to express the [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect forms]] of certain verbs:
::''Je '''suis''' venu.'' French for "I have come", literally "I am come."
This last usage was formerly prevalent in English also. The auxiliary functions of these verbs derive from their copular function, and can be interpreted as a special case of the copular function (the verbal form that follows it being considered adjectival).

Another auxiliary-type usage of the copula in English is together with the [[to-infinitive|''to''-infinitive]] to denote an obligatory action or expected occurrence: "I am to serve you"; "The manager is to resign". This can also be put into past tense: "We were to leave at 9". For forms like "if I was/were to come", see [[English conditional sentences]].

===Existential usage===
The English ''to be'', and its equivalents in certain other languages, also have a non-copular use as an existential verb, meaning "to exist". This use is illustrated in the following sentences: ''I want only '''to be''', and that is enough''; ''[[Cogito ergo sum|I think therefore I '''am''']]''; ''[[To be, or not to be|'''To be''' or not '''to be''']], that is the question.'' In these cases the verb itself expresses a predicate (that of [[existence]]), rather than linking to a predicative expression as it does when used as a copula. In [[ontology]] it is sometimes suggested that the "is" of existence is reducible to the "is" of property attribution or class membership; to be, [[Aristotle]] held, is to be ''something''. However [[Abelard]] in his ''Dialectica'' made a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' argument against the idea that the copula can express existence.<ref>Kneale - Kneale 1962 and Moro 1997</ref>

Similar examples can be found in many other languages; for example, the French and Latin equivalents of ''I think therefore I am'' are ''Je pense, donc je '''suis''''' and ''Cogito ergo '''sum''''', where ''suis'' and ''sum'' are the equivalents of English ''am'', normally used as copulas. However other languages prefer a different verb for existential use, as in the Spanish version ''Pienso, luego '''existo''''' (where the verb ''existir'' "to exist" is used rather than the copula ''ser'' or ''estar'' "to be"). 

Another type of existential usage is in clauses of the ''[[there is]]...'' or ''there are...'' type. Languages differ in the way they express such meanings; some of them use the copular verb, possibly with an [[expletive pronoun]] like the English ''there'', while other languages use different verbs and constructions, like the French ''il y a'' (which uses parts of the verb ''avoir'' "to have", not the copula ''être'') or the Swedish ''finns'' (the passive voice of the verb for "to find"). For details, see [[existential clause]].

Relying on a unified theory of copular sentences, it has been proposed that the English ''there''-sentences are subtypes of [[inverse copular construction]]s.<ref>See Moro 1997, and "existential sentences and expletive ''there''" in Everaert et al. 2006, for a detailed discussion of this issue and a historical survey of the major proposals.</ref>

==Zero copula==
{{main|Zero copula}}
In some languages, copula omission occurs within a particular grammatical context. For example, speakers of [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Quechuan languages]] consistently drop the copula in present tense: Russian: я&nbsp;&mdash; человек, ''ya&nbsp;&mdash; chelovek'' "I (am a) person"; Hungarian: ''ő ember'', "s/he (is) a human"; Arabic: أنا إنسان ''ʔanā ʔinsān'', "I (am) a human"; Hebrew: אני אדם ''ʔani ʔadam'' "I (am a) human"; Southern Quechua: ''payqa runam'' "s/he (is) a human".  This usage is known generically as the zero copula. Note that in other tenses (sometimes in other persons besides third singular) the copula usually reappears.

In informal speech of English, the copula may be dropped. This is a feature of [[African American vernacular English]] but is also used by a variety of English speakers in informal contexts.<ref>Bender, Emily (2000) Syntactic Variation and Linguistic Competence: The Case of AAVE Copula Absence. Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford University</ref> An example: "Where you at? We at the store."

In Ancient Greek, when an adjective precedes a noun with an article, the copula is understood.  Thus, ὁ οἴκος ἐστὶ μακρός, "the house is large," can be written μακρός ὁ οἴκος, "large the house (is)."

In Quechua ([[Southern Quechua]] used for the examples) zero copula is restricted to present tense in third person singular only (''kan''): ''Payqa runam'' &nbsp;&mdash; "(s)he is a human"; but: ''(paykuna) runakunam kanku'' "(they) are human".

In Hungarian, zero copula is restricted to present tense in third person singular and plural: ''Ő ember''/''Ők emberek''&nbsp;&mdash; "s/he is a human"/"they are humans"; but: ''(én) ember vagyok'' "I am a human", ''(te) ember vagy'' "you are a human", ''mi emberek vagyunk'' "we are humans", ''(ti) emberek vagytok'' "you (all) are humans". The copula also reappears for stating locations: ''az emberek a házban vannak'', "the people are in the house," and for stating time: ''hat óra van'', "it is six o'clock." However, the copula may optionally get omitted in colloquial language: ''hat óra (van),'' "it is six o'clock."

Hungarian uses a copula to say ''Itt van Róbert'' "Bob is here" (and this not only with regard to third person singular/plural), but not to say ''Róbert öreg'' "Bob is old". This is to relate a subject to a more temporary condition/state taking place in ''space'' (very often in the sense of [[Lojban]] ''zvati'': ''la rabyrt. zvati ne'i le zdani'' "Robert is in the house").

Further restrictions may apply before omission is permitted. For example, in the [[Irish language]], ''is'', the present tense of the copula, may be omitted when the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is a noun. ''Ba'' the past/conditional cannot be deleted. If the present copula is omitted, the following pronoun ''é, í, iad'' preceding the noun is omitted as well.

==Additional copulas==
Sometimes the term ''copula'' is taken to include not only a language's equivalent(s) to the verb ''be'', but also other verbs or forms which serve to link a subject to a predicative expression (while adding [[semantic]] content of their own). For example, English verbs such as ''become'', ''get'', ''feel'', ''look'' and ''seem'' can have this function, as in the following sentences (where the predicative expression – the complement of the verb – is in italics):
::She became ''a student''.
::They look ''tired''.
(This usage should be distinguished from the use of some of these verbs as "action" verbs, as in ''They look at the wall'', where ''look'' denotes an action and cannot be replaced by the basic copula ''are''.) 

Some verbs have rarer, secondary uses as copular verbs, such as the verb ''fall'' in sentences like ''The zebra fell victim to the lion.''

These extra copulas are sometimes called "semi-copulas" or "pseudo-copulas".<ref>C.S. Butler, ''Structure and Function: A Guide to the Three Major Structural-Functional Theories'', John Benjamins Publishing, 2003, pp. 425–426.</ref> For a list of common verbs of this type in English, see [[List of English copulae]].

==Copulas in particular languages==

===English===
The English copular verb ''be'' has eight forms (more than any other English verb): ''be'', ''am'', ''is'', ''are'', ''being'', ''was'', ''were'', ''been''. Additional archaic forms include ''art'', ''wast'', ''wert'', and occasionally ''beest'' (as a [[English subjunctive|subjunctive]]). For more details see [[English verbs]]. For the etymology of the various forms, see [[Indo-European copula]].

The main uses of the copula in English are described in the above sections. The possibility of copula omission is mentioned under {{p/s|Zero copula}}.

A particular construction found in English (particularly in speech) is the use of two successive copulas when only one is necessary, as in ''My point is, is that...'' (the acceptability of this construction is one of the [[disputes in English grammar|disputed matters]] in English grammar). For more information see [[Double copula]].

===Indo-European===
{{main|Indo-European copula}}
In [[Indo-European language]]s, the words meaning ''to be'' are sometimes similar to each other. Due to the high frequency of their use, their inflection retains a considerable degree of similarity in some cases. Thus, for example, the English form ''is'' is a [[cognate]] of German ''ist'', Latin ''est'' and Russian ''<nowiki>jest'</nowiki>'', even though the Germanic, Italic and Slavic language groups split at least 3000 years ago. The origins of the copulas of most Indo-European languages can be traced back to four [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] stems: ''*es-'' (''*h<sub>1</sub>es-''), ''*sta-'' (''*steh<sub>2</sub>-''), ''*wes-'' and ''*bhu-'' (''*bʰuH-'').

===Georgian===
As in English, the verb "to be" (''qopna'') is irregular in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] (a [[South Caucasian languages|Kartvelian language]]); different verb roots are employed in different tenses. The roots -''ar''-, -''kn''-, -''qav''-, and -''qop''- (past participle) are used in the present tense, future tense, past tense and the perfective tenses respectively. Examples:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli v''ar.
| "I ''am'' a teacher."
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli vi''kn''ebi''.
| "I ''will be'' a teacher."
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli vi''qav''i''.
| "I ''was'' a teacher."
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli v''qop''ilv''ar.
| "I ''have been'' a teacher."
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli v''qop''ili''qav''i''.
| "I ''had been'' a teacher."
|}

Note that, in the last two examples (perfective and pluperfect), two roots are used in one verb compound. In the perfective tense, the root ''qop'' (which is the expected root for the perfective tense) is followed by the root ''ar'', which is the root for the present tense. In the pluperfective tense, again, the root ''qop'' is followed by the past tense root ''qav''. This formation is very similar to [[German language|German]] (an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]]), where the perfect and the pluperfect are expressed in the following way:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Ich'' bin ''Lehrer'' gewesen.
| "I have been a teacher", literally "I ''am'' teacher ''been''."
|-
| ''Ich'' war ''Lehrer'' gewesen.
| "I had been a teacher", literally "I ''was'' teacher ''been''."
|}

Here, ''gewesen'' is the past participle of ''sein'' ("to be") in German. In both examples, as in Georgian, this participle is used together with the present and the past forms of the verb in order to conjugate for the perfect and the pluperfect aspects.

===Romance===
{{main|Romance copula}}
Copulas in the [[Romance languages]] usually consist of two different verbs that can be translated as "to be", the main one from the Latin ''esse'' (via [[Vulgar Latin]] ''essere''; ''esse'' deriving from ''*es-''), often referenced as ''sum'', another of the Latin verb's [[principal parts]]), and a secondary one from ''stare'' (from ''*sta-''), often referenced as ''sto'', another of that Latin verb's [[principal parts]].  The resulting distinction in the modern forms is found in all the [[Iberian Romance languages]], and to a lesser extent Italian, but not in French or Romanian.  The difference is that the first usually refers to essential characteristics, while the second refers to states and situations, e.g., "Bob is old" versus "Bob is well". A similar division is found in the non-Romance Basque language (viz. ''egon'' and ''izan''). (Note that the English words just used, "essential" and "state", are also cognate with the Latin infinitives ''esse'' and ''stare''. The word "stay" also comes from Latin stare, through Middle French "estai", stem of Old French "ester".) In Spanish and Portuguese, the high degree of verbal [[inflection]], plus the existence of two copulas (''ser'' and ''estar''), means that there are 105 (Spanish) and 110 (Portuguese)<ref>http://www.conjuga-me.net</ref> separate forms to express the copula, compared to eight in English and one in Chinese.

{|class="wikitable"

|- align=left

| ''Bob'' sta ''bene''. || ''Bob'' está ''bien''. || "Bob is well."
|}

In some cases, the verb itself changes the meaning of the adjective/sentence. The following examples are from Portuguese: 

{|class="wikitable"

|- align=left
! align=left | ''Sto''-derived
| ''O Bob'' está ''bem''. || "Bob is feeling well." || ''O Bob'' está ''parvo''. || "Bob is acting/being silly."
|}

===Slavic===
Some [[Slavic language]]s make a distinction between essence and state (similar to that discussed in the above section on the [[#Romance|Romance]] languages), by putting a predicative expression denoting a state into the [[instrumental case]], while essential characteristics are in the [[nominative case|nominative]]. This can apply with other copula verbs as well (e.g. the verbs for "become" are normally used with the instrumental).

As noted above under {{p/s|Zero copula}}, Russian and other [[East Slavic languages]] generally omit the copula in the present tense.

===Irish===
In [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]], not only are there two copulas but the [[syntax]] is also changed when one is distinguishing between states or situations and essential characteristics. Describing the subject's state or situation typically uses the normal [[verb–subject–object|VSO ordering]] with the verb ''bí''. The copula ''is'' is used to state essential characteristics or equivalences.

In Irish, the copula is used for things that are in a permanent state. 

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1" valign="top"
| align=left valign=top|  || align=right valign=top |  || align=left valign=top | 
|- 
|''Is fear Liam''|| "Liam is a man" ||(lit., is man Liam)
|- 
|''Is leabhar &eacute; sin''|| "That is a book" ||(lit., is book it that) 
|}

The word "is" is the copula (rhymes with the English word "hiss").  
The pronoun used with the copula is different from the normal pronoun.  For a masculine singular noun, "&eacute;" is used (for "he" or "it"), as opposed to the normal pronoun "s&eacute;"; for a feminine singular noun, "&iacute;" is used (for "she" or "it"), as opposed to normal pronoun "s&iacute;"; for plural nouns, "iad" is used (for "they" or "those"), as opposed to the normal pronoun "siad".<ref>Myles Dillon and Donncha &oacute; Cr&oacute;in&iacute;n, Irish, Teach Yourself Books, Saint Paul's House, Warwick Lane London EC4. Lesson VIII, "The Copula", p. 52</ref>

To describe non-permanent states, "to be" is used, e.g., ''Tá mé ag rith'' "I am running".

===Haitian Creole===
[[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]], a [[French-based creole language]], has three forms of the copula: ''se'', ''ye'', and the [[zero copula]], no word at all (the position of which will be indicated with ''Ø'', just for purposes of illustration).

Although no textual record exists of Haitian-Creole at its earliest stages of development from French, ''se'' is derived from French {{IPA-fr|se|}} (written ''c'est''), which is the normal French contraction of {{IPA-fr|sə|}} (that, written ''ce'') and the copula {{IPA-fr|e|}} (is, written ''est'') (a form of the verb ''être'').

The derivation of ''ye'' is less obvious; but we can assume that the French source was {{IPA-fr|ile|}} ("he/it is", written ''il est''), which, in rapidly spoken French, is very commonly pronounced as {{IPA-fr|je|}} (typically written ''y est'').

The use of a zero copula is unknown in French, and it is thought to be an innovation from the early days when Haitian-Creole was first developing as a Romance-based [[pidgin]].  Latin also sometimes used a zero copula.

Which of ''se'' / ''ye'' / ''Ø'' is used in any given copula clause depends on complex syntactic factors that we can superficially summarize in the following four rules:

1. Use ''Ø'' (i.e., no word at all) in declarative sentences where the complement is an adjective phrase, prepositional phrase, or adverb phrase:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Li te Ø an Ayiti.''
| "She was in Haiti." || (she ''past-tense'' in Haiti)
|-
| ''Liv-la Ø jon.''
| "The book is yellow." || (book-the yellow)
|-
| ''Timoun-yo Ø lakay.''
| "The kids are [at] home." || (kids-the home)
|}

2. Use ''se'' when the complement is a noun phrase.  But note that, whereas other verbs come ''after'' any tense/mood/aspect particles (like ''pa'' to mark negation, or ''te'' to explicitly mark past tense, or ''ap'' to mark progressive aspect), ''se'' comes ''before'' any such particles:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Chal se ekriven.''
| "Charles is writer."
|-
| ''Chal se pa ekriven.''
| "Charles is not writer." cf. with the verb ''kouri'' ("run"): ''Chal pa kouri'', not ''Chal kouri pa.''
|-
| ''Chal, ki se ekriven, pa vini.''
| "Charles, who is writer, not come."
|}

3. Use ''se'' where French and English have a [[dummy pronoun|dummy "it"]] subject:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Se mwen!''
| "It's me!" French ''C'est moi!''
|-
| ''Se pa fasil.''
| "It's not easy," colloquial French ''C'est pas facile.''
|}

4. Finally, use the other copula form ''ye'' in situations where the sentence's syntax leaves the copula at the end of a phrase:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Kijan ou ye?''
| "How you are?"
|-
| ''Pou kimoun liv-la te ye?''
| "Whose book was it?" || (of who book-the ''past-tense'' is?)
|-
| ''M pa konnen kimoun li ye.''
| "I don't know who he is." || (I not know who he is)
|-
| ''Se yon ekriven Chal ye.''
| "Charles is a ''writer''!" || (it's a writer Charles is; cf. French ''C'est un écrivain qu'il est.'')
|}

The above is, however, only a simplified analysis.<ref>[[#Howe90|Howe 1990]]. Source for most of the Haitian data in this article; for more details on syntactic conditions as well as Haitian-specific copula constructions, such as ''se kouri m ap kouri'' (It's run I ''progressive'' run; "I'm really running!"), see the grammar sketch in this publication.</ref><ref>[[#Vald88|Valdman & Rosemond 1988]].</ref>

===Japanese===
[[Japanese language|Japanese]] has copulas that would most often be translated as one of the so-called be-verbs of English.

The '''Japanese copula''' has many forms. The words ''da'' and ''desu'' are used to [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] sentences, while ''na'' and ''de'' are particles used within sentences to modify or connect.

Japanese sentences with copulas most often equate one thing with another, that is, they are of the form "A is B." Examples:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| 私は学生だ。
| ''Watashi wa gakusei da.'' || "I'm a student." || (lit., I <small>TOPIC</small> student <small>COPULA</small>)
|-
| これはペンです。
| ''Kore wa pen desu.'' || "This is a pen." || (lit., this <small>TOPIC</small> pen <small>COPULA-POLITE</small>)
|}

The difference between ''da'' and ''desu'' appears simple. For instance ''desu'' is [[Honorific speech in Japanese|more formal and polite]] than ''da''. Thus, many sentences such as the ones below are almost identical in meaning and differ in the speaker's politeness to the [[addressee]] and in nuance of how assured the person is of their statement. However, ''desu'' may never come before the end of a sentence, and ''da'' is used exclusively to delineate subordinate clauses. In addition, ''da'' is always declarative, never interrogative.

Japanese sentences may be predicated with copulas or with verbs. However, ''desu'' may not always be a predicate. In some cases, its only function is to make a sentence predicated with a [[stative verb]] more polite.  However, ''da'' always functions as a predicate, so it cannot be combined with a stative verb, because sentences need only one predicate. See the examples below.

|-
| <sup>*</sup>このビールはおいしいだ。
| <sup>*</sup>''Kono bīru wa oishii da.'' || colspan=2 | This is unacceptable because ''da'' may only serve as a predicate.
|}

There are several [[theories]] as to the origin of ''desu''; one is that it is a shortened form of であります ''de arimasu'', which is a polite form of である ''de aru''. In general, both forms are used in only writing and more formal situations. Another form, でございます ''de gozaimasu'', which is the more formal version of ''de arimasu'', in the etymological sense a conjugation of でござる ''de gozaru'' and an honorific suffix -ます ''-masu'', is also used in some situations and is very polite. Note that ''de aru'' and ''de gozaru'' are considered to be compounds of a particle で ''de'', and existential verbs ''aru'' and ''gozaru''. です ''desu'' may be pronounced っす ''ssu'' in colloquial speech. The copula is subject to dialectal variation throughout Japan, resulting in forms such as や ''ya'' (in [[Kansai dialect|Kansai]]) and じゃ ''ja'' (in [[Hiroshima]]).

Japanese also has two verbs corresponding to English "to be": ''aru'' and ''iru''. They are not copulas but existential verbs. ''Aru'' is used for inanimate objects, including plants, whereas ''iru'' is used for animate things like people, animals, and robots, though there are exceptions to this generalization.

[[Japanese language|Japanese]] speakers, when learning English, usually drop the auxiliary verbs "be" and "do" due to believing incorrectly that "be" is a semantically empty copula equivalent to "desu" and "da".<ref>{{cite journal | journal = TESL Working Paper Series | title = The English Copula Be: Japanese Learners’ Confusion | author = Sayuri Kusutani | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | date = Fall 2006 | url = http://www.hpu.edu/CHSS/LangLing/TESOL/ProfessionalDevelopment/200680TWPfall06/04Kusutani_Syntax.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

===Korean===
For sentences with '''predicate nominatives''', the copula "이다" (i-da) is added to the predicate nominative (with no space in between).

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| 바나나는 과일이다. 
| ''Ba-na-na-neun gwa-il-i-da.''. || "Bananas are a fruit."
|}

Some adjectives (usually color adjectives) are nominalized and used with the copula "이다".

1. Without the copula "이다":

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| 바나나는 노랗다. 
| ''ba-na-na-neun no-rat-da.''. || "Bananas are yellow."
|}

2. With the copula "이다":

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| 바나나는 노란색이다. 
| ''ba-na-na-neun no-ran-saek-i-da.''. || "Bananas are yellow-coloured."
|}

Some Korean adjectives are derived using the copula. Separating these articles and nominalizing the former part will often result in a sentence with a related, but different meaning. Using the separated sentence in a situation where the un-separated sentence is appropriate is usually acceptable as the listener can decide what the speaker is trying to say using the context.

===Chinese===
<small>N.B. The characters used are [[Simplified Chinese|simplified]] ones, and the transcriptions given in italics reflect [[Standard Chinese]] pronunciation, using the [[Pinyin]] system.</small>

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] languages, both states and qualities are, in general, expressed with [[stative verb]]s (SV) with no need for a copula, e.g., in Mandarin, "to be tired" (累 ''lèi''), "to be hungry" (饿 ''è''), "to be located at" (在 ''zài''), "to be stupid" (笨 ''bèn'') and so forth. These verbs are usually preceded by an adverb such as 很 ''hěn'' ("very") or 不 ''bù'' ("not"). A sentence could also simply use a pronoun and a verb: for example, 我饿。 ''wǒ è.'' "I am hungry." See also [[Chinese adjectives]], and [[Chinese grammar]].

Only sentences with a noun as the complement (e.g., "this is my sister") use the verb "to be": 是 ''shì''. This is used frequently: For example, instead of having a verb meaning "to be Chinese", the usual expression is "to be a Chinese person", using 是 ''shì''.  Some scholars call this verb form an equative verb (EV), as published in some Yale Chinese textbooks.

The history of the Chinese copula 是 is a controversial subject.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Before the [[Han Dynasty]], the character served as a [[demonstrative pronoun]] meaning "this" (this usage survives in some idioms and proverbs, as well as in Japanese). Some linguists argue that 是 developed into a copula because it often appeared, as a repetitive subject, after the subject of a sentence (in [[classical Chinese]] we can say, for example: "George W. Bush, ''this'' president of the United States" meaning "George W. Bush ''is'' the president of the United States).<ref>{{cite book|last=Pulleyblank|first=Edwin G.|title=Outline of Classical Chinese Grammar|publisher=UBC Press|year=1995|location=Vancouver|isbn=0-7748-0541-2}}</ref> Other scholars do not completely accept the explanation, proposing that 是 served as a demonstrative pronoun and a copula at the same time in ancient Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} [[Etymology|Etymologically]], 是 developed from the meaning of "straight"; in modern Chinese, however, it can be combined with the modifier 的 ''de'' to mean "yes" or to show agreement.
e.g. Question: 你的汽车是不是红色的？ ''nǐ de qìchē shì bú shì hóngsè de?'' "Is your car red or not?"
Response: 是的。 ''shì de.'' "Is.", meaning "Yes.", or 不是。 ''bú shì.'' "Not is.", meaning "No."
A more common way of showing that the person asking the question is correct is by simply saying "right" or "correct", 对 ''duì'', which drops the modifier 的 ''de''; the corresponding negative answer is 不对 ''bú duì'', "Not right."

In [[Hokkien]] 是 ''sī'' acts as the copula, and 是 {{IPA|/z/}} is the equivalent in [[Wu Chinese]]. [[Cantonese]] uses 係 ([[Jyutping]]: hai6) instead of 是; similarly, [[Hakka language|Hakka]] uses 係 ''he<sup>55</sup>''.

===Siouan languages===<!-- This section is linked from [[Medicine man]] -->
In Siouan languages like [[Lakota language|Lakota]], in principle almost all words — according to their structure — are verbs. So not only (transitive, intransitive and so-called 'stative') verbs but even nouns often behave like verbs and do not need to have copulas.

For example, the word ''wičháša'' refers to a man, and the verb "to-be-a-man" is expressed as ''wimáčhaša/winíčhaša/wičháša'' (I am/you are/he is a man). Yet there also is a copula ''héčha'' (to be a ...) that in most cases is used: ''wičháša hemáčha/heníčha/héčha'' (I am/you are/he is a man).

In order to express the statement "I am a doctor of profession," one has to say ''pezuta wičháša hemáčha''. But, in order to express that that person is THE doctor (say, that had been phoned to help), one must use another copula ''iyé'' (to be the one): ''pežúta wičháša (kiŋ) miyé yeló'' (medicine-man DEF ART I-am-the-one MALE ASSERT).

In order to refer to space (e.g., Robert is in the house), various verbs are used, e.g., ''yaŋkÁ'' (lit.: to sit) for humans, or ''háŋ/hé'' (to stand upright) for inanimate objects of a certain shape. "Robert is in the house" could be translated as ''Robert thimáhel yaŋké (yeló)'', whereas "there's one restaurant next to the gas station" translates as "owótethipi wígli-oínažiŋ kiŋ hél isákhib waŋ hé".

===Constructed languages===
The [[constructed language]] [[Lojban]] has copulas, but they are rarely used, and are sometimes viewed with distaste in the Lojban community, because all words that express a predicate can be used as verbs. The three sentences "Bob runs", "Bob is old", and "Bob is a fireman", for instance, would all have the same form in Lojban: ''la bob. bajra'', ''la bob. tolcitno'', and ''la bob. fagdirpre''. There are several different copulas: ''me'' turns whatever follows the word ''me'' into a verb that means ''to be'' what it follows. For example, ''me la bob.'' means ''to be Bob.'' Another copula is ''du'', which is a verb that means all its arguments are the same thing (equal).<ref>[http://ptolemy.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/lojbanbrochure/lessons/less12eq.html Lojban For Beginners]</ref>

The [[E-Prime]] language, based on English, simply avoids the issue by not having a generic copula. It requires instead a specific form such as "remains", "becomes", "lies", or "equals".

[[Esperanto]] uses the copula much as English. The infinitive is ''esti'', and the whole conjugation is regular (as with all Esperanto verbs). In addition, adjectival roots can be turned into stative verbs: ''La ĉielo bluas.'' "The sky is blue."

Likewise, [[Ido (language)|Ido]] has a copula that works as English "to be". Its infinitive is ''esar'', and, as is the case in Esperanto, all of its forms are regular: The simple present is ''esas'' for all persons; the simple past is ''esis'', the simple future is ''esos'', and the imperative is ''esez'', among a few more forms. However, Ido also has an alternative irregular form for the simple present ("es"), which some Idists frown upon. The possibility to turn adjectives and even nouns into verbs also exist, although this is mostly done by means of an affix, on top of the verbal endings. The affix is "-es-". So, "The sky is blue." can be said as "La cielo bluesas". As can be seen, the suffix "-es-" plus the verbal desinence "-as" are simply the verb "to be" annexed to the adjectival or nominal root.

[[Interlingua]] speakers use copulas with the same freedom as speakers of Slavic, Germanic, and Romance languages. In addition to combinations with ''esser'' ('to be'), expressions such as ''cader prede'' ('to fall prey') are common. ''Esser'' is stated, rather than omitted as in Russian.
