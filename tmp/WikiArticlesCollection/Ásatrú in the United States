'''''{{lang|is|Ásatrú}}''''' (from [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] for "[[Æsir]] faith", pronounced {{IPA-is|auːsatruː|}}, in [[Old Norse]] {{IPA-non|aːsatruː|}}) is a form of [[Germanic neopaganism]] which developed in the  [[neopaganism in the United States|United States]] from the 1970s.
It focuses on historical   [[Norse paganism]] of the [[Viking Age]] as described in the [[Edda]]s, but proponents also take a more inclusive approach, defining it as "Northern European Heathenry" not limited to a specific historical period.

==Terminology==
''{{lang|is|Ásatrú}}'' is an [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (and equivalently [[Old Norse]]) term consisting of two parts. The first is ''{{lang|is|Ása}}-'', genitive of ''{{lang|is|Áss}}'', denoting one of the group of Norse gods called {{lang|is|[[Æsir]]}}.<ref>Zoega (1910): "one of the old heathen gods in general, or especially one of the older branch, in opposition to the younger ones (the [[Vanir]])"[http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h037.php]</ref> The second part, ''{{lang|is|trú}}'', means "faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief"<ref>[http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h442.php Zoega (1910)]</ref> (archaic English ''[[:wikt:troth|troth]]'' "loyalty, honesty, good faith"). Thus, ''{{lang|is|Ásatrú}}'' means "belief / faith in the Æsir / gods".

The term is the Old Norse/Icelandic translation of ''{{lang|sv|Asetro}}'', a [[neologism]] coined in the context of 19th century [[romantic nationalism]], used by [[Edvard Grieg]] in his 1870 opera ''[[Olaf Trygvason]]''. The use of the term ''Ásatrú'' for Germanic heathenism preceding 19th century revivalist movements is therefore an [[anachronism]].

''{{lang|is|Ásatrúarmaður}}'' (plural ''{{lang|is|Ásatrúarmenn}}''), the term used to identify those who practice Ásatrú, is a compound with ''{{lang|is|maður}}'' (Old Norse ''{{lang|non|maðr}}'') "man".<ref>Irrespective of sex. [http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h284.php], see [[Mannaz]].</ref> In English usage, the genitive ''{{lang|is|Asatruar}}'' "of Æsir faith" is often used on its own to denote adherents (both singular and plural).

===Differences from Scandinavian and German usage===
There are two main strains of contemporary Germanic Paganism known as ''Ásatrú'', originating near-simultaneously in Iceland (''{{lang|is|[[Ásatrúarfélagið]]}}'', 1972) and the USA ([[Asatru Free Assembly]], 1974). While the [[Neopaganism in Scandinavia|Scandinavian branch]] emphasizes [[polytheism|polytheistic]] spirituality rooted in medieval and contemporary [[Scandinavian folklore]], the [[Neopaganism in the United States|American branch]] postulates a "[[native religion]] of the peoples of [[Northern Europe]]" reaching back into the [[paleolithic]].<ref>"Asatru reflects the deeper religiosity common to virtually all the nations of Europe." ([http://runestone.org/home.html Asatru Folk Assembly]); "Ásatrú is thousands of years old. its beginnings are lost in prehistory, but as an organized system, it is older by far than Christianity. Strictly speaking, since Ásatrú is the religion which springs from the specific spiritual beliefs of the Northern Europeans, it is as old as this branch of the human race, which came into being 40,000 years ago." ([http://asatru.org/ Asatru Alliance])</ref> [[Neopaganism in Germany|In Germany]], the term ''Asatru'' is used in the wider sense of [[Germanic neopaganism]].

As ''Ásatrú'' implies a focus on polytheistic belief in the Æsir, usage of the term in Scandinavia has declined somewhat. In Scandinavia, ''forn sed'' / ''forn siðr'' "old custom", ''Nordisk sed'' "Nordic custom" or ''hedensk sed'' / ''heiðinn siður'' "heathen custom" are preferred.<ref>"We prefer to refer to our faith as 'den forna seden' (The Old Way) rather than Asatru." ([http://www.asatrosamfundet.se/ Sveriges Asatrosamfund])</ref> In both the [[Anglosphere]] and [[German-speaking Europe]], the word Asatru is widely used interchangeably with other terms for [[Germanic Neopaganism]].<ref name= "Germanic Spirituality">{{cite journal| author =Linzie, Bil| title =Germanic Spirituality| version =| publisher =| date =July 2003| url =http://www.northvegr.org/northern/book/spirituality.pdf| format =PDF| accessdate =February 2007 }}</ref>

There are notable differences of emphasis between ''Ásatrú'' as practiced in the USA and in Scandinavia. According to Strmiska and Sigurvinsson (2005), American Asatruar tend to prefer a more devotional form of worship and a more emotional conception of the Nordic gods than Scandinavian practitioners, reflecting the parallel tendency of highly emotional forms of Christianity prevalent in the United States.<ref>"American Nordic Pagans want to feel an intimate relationship with their gods, not unlike evangelical attitudes towards Jesus. Icelandic Asatruar, by contrast, are more focused on devotion to their past cultural heritage rather than to particular gods." Strmiska and Sigurvinsson (2005), p. 165.</ref>

==Organizations==
Most organized Nordic Paganism in the United States occurs in numerous local [[Kindred (Asatru)|Kindreds]] but there are three large national organizations.  The largest is [[The Troth]], followed by the [[Ásatrú Alliance]], and the [[Asatru Folk Assembly|Ásatrú Folk Assembly]].

[[The Troth]], currently headed by Steve Abell, publishes the "Idunna" journal, which is the most widely distributed Asatru journal in publication.  Yearly gatherings of [[The Troth]], called "TrothMoot," usually draws attendance of around 50-75 people.    [[The Troth]] held its 25th Anniversary Jubilee in 2012.

The [[Ásatrú Alliance]] is headed by Valgard Murray, and publishes the "Vor Tru" newsletter, and held its 25th annual "[[Althing]]" gathering in 2005.<ref name= "AA Althing Report">{{cite web| last =Murray| first =Valgard| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =AlThing 25 Report| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://asatru.org/Althingreport.html#top| doi =| accessdate =February 2007 }}</ref>

The [[Ásatrú Folk Assembly]], headed by [[Stephen McNallen]], holds a yearly Midsummer gathering which draws attendance of around 40 people.

A notable regional group is Jotun's Bane Kindred (JBK), headed by Mark Ludwig Stinson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://heathengods.com/jbk/index.htm |title=Jotun's Bane Kindred |last1=Stinson |first1=Mark |date=May 1, 2013 |website=Temple of Our Heathen Gods |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>  Stinson promotes "regional heathenry" over "Internet heathenry" and formed an active network of "Midwest Tribes".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heathengods.com/midwest/ |title=Midwest Tribes – The Midwest Thing |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=Aug 18, 2013 |website=Temple of Our Heathen Gods |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>  If organized, it would be the largest organization in America.  JBK's yearly event 'Lightning Across the Plains' regularly draws attendance of over 250.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heathengods.com/lightning/ |title=Lightning Across the Plains |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=Aug 18, 2013 |website=Temple of Our Heathen Gods |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

==History==
In the early 1970s, following the revival of Asatru in Iceland, [[Stephen McNallen]], a former [[U.S. Army]] [[Airborne forces|Airborne]] [[U.S. Army Ranger|Ranger]], began publishing a newsletter titled ''The Runestone''. He and Stine also formed an organization called the ''Ásatrú Free Assembly''. [[Else Christensen|Else Christensen's]] ''[[Odinism]]'', which is sometimes identified with the term ''Ásatrú'', originated around the same period.

In 1986, the "[[folkish]] vs. [[universalist]]" dispute and the dispute over the stance of Ásatrú towards [[white supremacism]] escalated, resulting in the breakup of the ''Asatru Free Assembly''. The universalist branch reformed as [[The Troth]], while the folkish branch became the [[Ásatrú Alliance]] (AA).

In 1994, McNallen formed a new organization, the  [[Ásatrú Folk Assembly]] (AFA), which some refer to as "the new AFA".

In 1997, the Britain based [[Odinic Rite]] (OR) founded a US chapter (ORV).

In 2003 Volkshof Kindred was formed and was the first Asatru Church recognized in the state of Minnesota. They were a driving force in the midwest which resulted in the formation of several Midwest kindreds.

In the late 2000s, former Kansas City police sergeant Mark Stinson formed The Jotun's Bane Kindred (JBK).

The [[Ásatrú Alliance]] is the oldest surviving organization.

==Beliefs and practice==

''Ásatrú'' groups and the individual ''Ásatrúarmenn'' have no universal means of practice.  Some general commonalities exist however, as outlined below:

===Blót===
{{Main|Blót}}
Many Ásatrú groups celebrate with ''blóts''. Historically, the blót was an event that focused on a communal sacrifice at various times of the year for a number of purposes. Families and extended family organizations would gather to participate in the communal event.

Modern blóts are celebrated several times during the year. Ásatrú communities (kindreds, hearths, mots) have different approaches to the frequency of blóts and their means of celebrating them.

===Sumbel===
{{Main|Sumbel}}
A central ritual of Ásatrú is the ''[[sumbel]]'', a drinking-ritual in which a [[drinking horn]] full of mead or ale is passed around and a series of toasts are made, usually to gods, ancestors, and/or heroes of the religion.  The toasts vary by group, and some groups make a distinction between a "regular" sumbel and a "high" sumbel, which have different levels of formality, and different rules during toasting. Participants may also make boasts of their own deeds, or oaths or promises of future actions. Words spoken during the sumbel are considered carefully and any oaths made are considered sacrosanct, becoming part of the destiny of those assembled.

===Goðar===
{{Main|Goði}}
A ''Goði'' or ''Gothi'' (plural ''goðar'') is the historical [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] term for a [[priest]] and [[tribal chief|chieftain]] in Norse paganism. ''Gyðja'' signifies a priestess. Goði literally means ''"speaker for the gods"'', and is used to denote the priesthood or those who officiate over rituals in Ásatrú. Several groups, most notably  [[the Troth]] have organized clergy programs.<ref name=CLERGY>Information regarding the Troth's clergy program can be found on their official website here: [http://www.thetroth.org/clergy/]</ref> However, there is no universal standard for the Goðar amongst organizations, and the title is usually only significant to the particular group with whom they work.<ref name= "Gothar">{{cite web| last =Murray| first =Valgard| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The Role of the Gothar in the Asatru Community| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://asatru.org/gothar.html| doi =| accessdate =February 2007}}</ref>

===Kindred===
{{Main|Kindred_(Asatru)}}
In the [[Heathenism (contemporary religion)|Heathen]] movements, a '''kindred''' is a local worship group and organizational unit. Other terms used are ''hearth'', ''theod'' (only within the [[Theodism|Theodish]] movement), ''blotgroup'', ''sippe'', and other less popular ones such as ''garth'', ''[[stead]]'', ''[[:wikt:church|church]]'',  and others.

Kindreds are usually grassroots groups which may or may not be affiliated with a national organization such as the [[Ásatrú Alliance]], or [[The Troth]], rather than the [[Swedish Forn Sed Assembly]] or the [[Odinic Rite]]. A kindred not associated with any other group is known as an ''independent kindred'', which is more typical within the US than elsewhere.

==Related movements==

===Theodism===
{{primary sources|date=November 2011}}
''Theodism'', or ''Þéodisc Geléafa''  ([[Old English language|Old English]]: "tribal belief") is another form of Germanic neopaganism that developed in the United States contemporaneous with Asatru.<ref>{{cite book | first=Garman | last=Lord | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=2000 | title=The Way of the Heathen: A Handbook of Greater Theodism | edition= | publisher=Theod | location= | isbn=1-929340-01-X }}.
{{cite book | first=Dan | last=O'Halloran | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=2005 | title=Thewbok: A Handbook of Theodish Thew | edition= | publisher= | location= | isbn=0-9777610-0-2 }}
</ref>

While there are some similarities between the two movements,  Theodism derived its origins primarily as a reaction to [[Wicca]]. In 1971, Garman Lord and other practitioners of Gardnerian Wicca founded The Coven Witan of Anglo-Saxon Wicca.<ref>Garman Lord, "The Evolution of Þéodisc Belief: Part I" Theod Magazine, Lammas, 1995</ref> 
Theodism is focused on the lore, beliefs and social structure - particularly the concept of ''[[:wikt:thew|thew]]'' (Old English ''[[:wikt:þeaw|þeaw]]'') or "customary law" - of various specific Germanic tribes. The main distinction between Theodism and other modern manifestations of [[Germanic Neopaganism]] along with pre-Christian religions, the Theodish are also attempting to reconstruct aspects of pre-Christian Germanic social order (including [[Germanic king|sacral kingship]]). 
In general, Theodish religious festivities are referred to as 'fainings' (meaning 'celebration'). As a rule, there are two sorts of rituals; [[blót]] and [[symbel]]. [[Húsel]] is technically part of blót.<ref>Swain Wodening, p. 100</ref> [[Symbel]] is normally held after the feast, inasmuch as it is custom not to have food present.<ref>Garman Lord, p. 27</ref>

Garman Lord formed the Witan Theod in [[Watertown, New York]], in 1976. A few years later, the Moody Hill Theod emerged as an offshoot of the Witan Theod.<ref name="ReferenceA">Garman Lord, "The Evolution of Þéodisc Belief: Part II" Theod Magazine, Lammas, 1995</ref>   In 1988 the Winland Rice was formed as an umbrella organization of Theodish groups.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Gert McQueen, Elder and Redesman of the [[The Troth|Ring of Troth]], was successful in lobbying the U.S. Army Chaplain’s Corps to adopt guidelines for recognizing heathen religions and Theodish belief in particular.

The Winland Rice dissolved in 2002. Several groups that have continued to call themselves Theodish. Axenthof Thiad originated in the early 1990s as the Fresena Thiad and part of the Winland Rice.<ref>http://www.axenthof.org</ref>  In 2005, Gerd Forsta Axenthoves changed the name to Axenthof Thiad.<ref>http://www.axenthof.org/aboutus.html</ref>  Eric Wodening founded Englatheod in July 2007, while Sweartfenn Theod was founded, by Jeffrey Runokivi, in December 2007. Both groups practice Anglo-Saxon Theodism, and have members that have belonged to both the Winland Rice and the Ealdriht.<ref>http://swainblog.englatheod.org/?p=36</ref> In New York, the New Normannii Reik of Theodish Belief was founded in 1997 and is led by [[Dan Halloran]],<ref name=Tanner2009>{{Citation

==Politics and controversies==
Ásatrú organizations have memberships which span the entire political and spiritual spectrum. There is a history of political controversy within organized US Ásatrú, mostly surrounding the question of how to deal with such adherents as place themselves in a context of the [[far right]] and [[white supremacy]], notably resulting in the fragmentation of the ''Asatru Free Assembly'' in 1986.

Externally, political activity on the part of Ásatrú organizations has surrounded campaigns against alleged [[Religious discrimination against Neopagans|religious discrimination]], such as the call for the introduction of an Ásatrú "emblem of  belief"  by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] to parallel the Wiccan pentacle granted to the widow of [[Patrick Stewart (soldier)|Patrick Stewart]] in 2006. In May 2013 the "Hammer of Thor" was added to the list of [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs emblems for headstones and markers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=National Cemetery Administration: Available Emblems of Belief for Placement on Government Headstones and Markers|url=http://www.cem.va.gov/hmm/emblems.asp|publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=12 May 2013|quote=55 – Hammer of Thor}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Elysia|title=Hammer of Thor now VA accepted symbol of faith|url=http://www.llewellyn.com/blog/2013/05/hammer-of-thor-now-va-accepted-symbol-of-faith/|publisher=Llewellyn|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>

===Folkish Ásatrú, Universalism and racialism===
{{Further|Neo-völkisch_movements#Nordic_racial_paganism}}

Historically, the main dispute between the national organizations has generally centered on the interpretation of "Nordic heritage" as either something cultural, or as something genetic or racial. In the internal discourse within American Ásatrú, this cultural/racial divide has long been known as "universalist" vs. "folkish" Asatru.<ref>Strmiska and Sigurvinsson (2005), pp. 134f.</ref>  
 
[[The Troth]] takes the "universalist" position,  claiming ''Asatru'' as a synonym for "Northern European Heathenry" taken to comprise "many variations, names, and practices, including [[Theodism]], Irminism, Odinism, and Anglo-Saxon Heathenry".  In the [[Neopaganism in the United Kingdom|UK]], Germanic Neopaganism is more commonly known as [[Odinism]] or as ''Heathenry''.  This is mostly a matter of terminology, and US Asatru may be equated with UK Odinism for practical purposes, as is evident in the short-lived [[International Asatru-Odinic Alliance]] of folkish Asatru/Odinist groups.

Some groups identifying as  Ásatrú have been associated with [[neo-Nazi]] and "[[White nationalism#White power|white power]]" movements.<ref name="Gods of the Blood">{{cite book | first =Matthias | last =Gardell | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2003 | month = | title =Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages =269–283 | publisher =Duke University Press | location = | isbn =0-8223-3071-7 | url = }}</ref> (See [[Wotanism]] for more details.)
This was notably an issue in the 1980s, when the ''Asatru Free Assembly'' disintegrated as a result of tensions between the folkish and the non-folkish factions{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.

Today, the three largest US American ''Ásatrú'' organizations have specifically denounced any association with racist groups.<ref>'''From the ''[[Asatru Alliance]]'s'' Bylaws:''' "The Alliance is apolitical; it is not a front for, nor shall it promote any political views of the 'Right' or 'Left'. Our Sacred temples, groves and Moots shall remain free of any political manifestations." [http://asatru.org/bylaws.html]</ref><ref>'''From the ''[[Asatru Folk Assembly]]'s'' Bylaws:''' "The belief that spirituality and ancestral heritage are related has nothing to do with notions of superiority. Ásatrú is not an excuse to look down on, much less to hate, members of any other race. On the contrary, we recognize the uniqueness and the value of all the different pieces that make up the human mosaic." [http://runestone.org/flash/home.html]</ref><ref>'''From ''[[The Troth]]'s'' Bylaws:''' "Discrimination on the basis of race, gender, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation shall not be practiced by the Troth or any affiliated group, whether in membership decisions or in conducting any of its activities."

[http://www.thetroth.org/organization/bylaws.html]</ref> A dividing issue is whether a person is "Folkish", meaning that an emphasis on ancestry and ancestor worship is a part of their belief system.

===Discrimination charges===
{{Further|Religious discrimination against Neopagans}}
Inmates of the "Intensive Management Unit"  at [[Washington State Penitentiary]] who are adherents of Ásatrú in 2001 were deprived of their [[Mjolnir|Thor's Hammer]] medallions.<ref>[http://www.prisonerlife.com/articles/articleID=3.cfm Walla Walla's Suppression of Religious Freedom]{{Verify credibility|date=July 2007}}</ref>
In 2007, a federal judge confirmed that Ásatrú adherents in US prisons have the right to possess a Thor’s Hammer pendant. An inmate sued the Virginia Department of Corrections after he was denied it while members of other religions were allowed their medallions.<ref>[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=18629 First Amendment Center: Va. inmate can challenge denial of Thor's Hammer]</ref>

In the Georgacarakos v. Watts case Peter N. Georgacarakos filed a pro se civil-rights complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against 19 prison officials for "interference with the free exercise of his Ásatrú religion" and "discrimination on the basis of his being Ásatrú".<ref>[http://www.kscourts.org/CA10/cases/2005/08/05-1180.htm Georgacarakos v.
