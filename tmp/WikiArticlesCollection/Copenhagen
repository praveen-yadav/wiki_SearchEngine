'''Copenhagen''' ({{IPAc-en|IPA|ˈ|k|oʊ|p|ən|h|eɪ|ɡ|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|
ˈ|k|oʊ|p|ən|h|ɑː|ɡ|ən}}; {{lang-da|København}} {{IPA-da|kʰøb̥m̩ˈhɑʊ̯ˀn|}} <small>({{Audio|da-København.ogg|listen|help=no}})</small>) is the capital and most populous city of [[Denmark]], with an [[Urban area|urban]] population of 1,230,728 and a [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] population of 1,967,727 ({{As of|2013|10|01|lc=on}}). Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of [[Zealand]], {{convert|42.3|km}} northwest of [[Malmö]], Sweden, {{convert|164|km}} northeast of [[Odense]], and {{convert|188|km}} southeast of [[Aarhus]] by sea and road via [[Sjaellands Odde]]. Copenhagen stretches across parts of [[Amager]] and also contains the enclave of [[Frederiksberg Municipality]], administered separately from [[Copenhagen Municipality]].

Originally a [[Viking]] fishing village founded in the 10th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the beginning of the 15th century. During the 17th century, under the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], it became a significant regional centre. Since the turn of the millennium, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by large investments in its institutions and infrastructure. Today Copenhagen is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark and one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Since the completion of the [[Øresund Bridge]], the metropolitan area of Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malmö. The combined area is known as the [[Øresund region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterized by promenades and waterfronts.

A diverse infrastructure allows for a blend of bicycles, cars and public transport while the [[Copenhagen Metro]] serves central Copenhagen together with the [[S-train]] network which also connects the outlying boroughs. Main-line railways also serve the surrounding areas and provide connections to southern Sweden via the airport and the Øresund Bridge. [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup]] is the largest airport in the Nordic countries, now serving over 2 million passengers a month.<ref name=autogeneret1>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/CPH/DK/INVESTOR/Trafik/2012/ |title=November - KÃ¸benhavns Lufthavne |publisher=Cph.dk |date= |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> There are currently many construction sites in the city as a result of infrastructure projects and [[City Circle Line|expansion of the Metro]].

==Etymology==
The city's origin as a harbour and a place of commerce is reflected in its name. Its original designation, from which the contemporary Danish name is derived, was ''Køpmannæhafn'', meaning "merchants' harbour", often simply ''Hafn'' or ''Havn''. The English [[cognate]] would be [[Chapmen|Chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|author=Oluf Nielsen|title=Kjøbenhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|year=1877|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> The English name for the city is derived from its [[Low German]] name, ''Kopenhagen''. The chemical element [[hafnium]] is also named for Copenhagen, whose [[Latin]] name is ''Hafnia'',{{sfn|Cardarelli|2008|p=336}} derived from the city's original name, ''Hafnæ'' ("harbour"). The bacterium ''[[Hafnia (bacterium)|Hafnia]]'' is also named after Copenhagen, being coined in 1954 by Vagn Møller of the [[State Serum Institute]] in Copenhagen.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360275/ |title=The Genus Hafnia: from Soup to Nuts |publisher=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health |date=30 January 2013 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Copenhagen}}
[[File:København1500.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstruction of Copenhagen as of {{circa|1500}}]]

===Early history===
Although the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metro have revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's [[Kongens Nytorv]] from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. But above all, close to the point where [[Strøget]] meets [[Rådhuspladsen]], the remains of an old church with graves dating to the 11th century have been unearthed. These finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins go back at least until the 11th century while substantial discoveries of flint tools in the area are evidence of settlements as far back as the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|title=Arkæologer graver ny teori om København op af mulden|publisher=''Videnskab.dk''|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Many historians believe the town dates to the late [[Viking Age]], and was possibly founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn I Forkbeard]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2013|p=35}} The natural harbour and good herring stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.<ref name=khdsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie|title=København - historie|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|date=|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> The first habitations seem to have been centred around [[Gammel Strand]] (literally "old shore") in the 11th century or even earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|title=Gammel Strand|publisher=Københavns Museum|accessdate=24 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref>

The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in [[Gesta Danorum]] refers to it as ''Portus Mercatorum'', which translates into Merchants' Harbour or in the [[Danish language|Danish]] of the time ''Købmannahavn''.<ref name=metro1415>Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pp. 14–15</ref> Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to [[Absalon|Bishop Absalon]]'s construction of a small fortress on the small island of [[Slotsholmen]] in 1167 where [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands today.{{sfn|Davies|1944|p=365}} The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} 
Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St Clemens Church had been built. Attacks with the Germans continued, and the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, replaced by [[Copenhagen Castle]].{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}}

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Arsenal Museum Copenhagen backend.jpg|thumb|Tøjhus Arsenal (1604)]]
[[File:Old Stock Exchange Copenhagen, pic-001.JPG|thumb|Børsen (completed 1640)]]
In 1186, a letter from [[Pope Urban III]] states that the castle of ''Hafn'' (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands including the town of Hafn were given to Archbishop Absalom of Roskilde by King [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]]. On Absalom's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the [[Diocese of Roskilde (Roman-Catholic)|Bishopric of Roskilde]].<ref name=khdsd/> Around 1200, the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]] was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town which began to expand around it.<ref name=khdsd/>

The town rose in prominence but was repeatedly attacked by the [[Hanseatic League]]. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]]<ref name="Copenhagen1898">{{cite book|last=Copenhagen|first=Dansk turistforening,|title=Copenhagen, the Capital of Denmark|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kJPVAAAAMAAJ|year=1898|page=49}}</ref> who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges.{{sfn|Booth|2003|p=9}} In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.{{sfn|Booth|2003|p=9}}

With the establishment of the [[Kalmar Union]] (1397–1523) between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when [[Eric of Pomerania]] moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle.<ref name="Ingebritsen2006">{{cite book|author=Christine Ingebritsen|title=Scandinavia in World Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v1VRPBAF9NcC&pg=PA7|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-0966-5|pages=7–}}</ref>{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}} The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]], following approval from Pope [[Sixtus IV]].<ref name="histuni">{{cite web|url=http://introduction.ku.dk/presentation/history/|title=History of the University|publisher=University of Copenhagen|accessdate=12 November 2013}}</ref> The university's Christian role in Danish society was forced to change during the [[Reformation]] in the late 1530s.<ref name="histuni"/>

===16th and 17th centuries===

In disputes prior to the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]] of 1536, the city which had been faithful to [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]] was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of [[Frederik I of Denmark|Frederik I]] who supported [[Lutheranism]]. Thereafter, Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536 during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malmö]] and [[Lübeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the Baltic supported by Dutch shipping. The high-ranking statesman [[Christoffer Valkendorff]] defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.<ref name=khdsd/>

During the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen experienced dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative, at the beginning of the 17th century there were two major developments on [[Slotsholmen]]: the  [[Tøjhus Museum|Tøjhus Arsenal]] and [[Børsen]], the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the [[Danish East India Company|East India Company]] was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of [[Christianshavn]] with its canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen.<ref name=kher>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavn_(Historie_-_Efter_Reformationen)|title=Københavns historie efter Reformationen|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|date=|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Christian IV was also responsible for sponsoring an array of ambitious building projects including [[Rosenborg Slot]] and the [[Rundetarn]].{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} In 1658–59, the city withstood a siege by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] under [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X]] and successfully repelled [[Assault on Copenhagen (1659)|a major assault]].<ref name=kher/>

By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Citadel]] in 1664 and the extension of [[Christianshavns Vold]] with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Nyholm]].<ref name=kher/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Milit%C3%A6r/S%C3%B8v%C3%A6rnet/Holmen|title=Holmen|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref>

===18th century===
[[File:Kbh amalienborg mpazdziora.jpg|thumb|Amalienborg Palace in Frederiksstaden (1750)]]
In 1711 the [[The plague during the Great Northern War|plague]] reduced Copenhagen's population of about 65,000 by one-third.{{sfn|Woodward|1998|p=10}} The city was also struck by two major fires, which destroyed much of infrastructure in the city.{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}} The [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728]] was the largest fire in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of October 20, 1728, and continued to burn until the morning of October 23. It destroyed approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost, and along with the [[Copenhagen fire of 1795|1795 fire]], it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.<ref>Raabyemagle, p. 16.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lauring|first=Kåre|title=Byen brænder|pages=86–88}}</ref>

A substantial amount of rebuilding followed the fire. In 1733, construction of the royal residence of [[Christiansborg Palace (1st)|Christiansborg Palace]] started, completed in 1745. In 1749, work began on the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] designed by [[Nicolai Eigtved]] in the [[Rococo]] style with the mansions which now form [[Amalienborg|Amalienborg Palace]] at its centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=1921 |title=Frederiksstaden, København|publisher=arkark.dk|date=|accessdate= 14 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Major extensions to the naval base of [[Holmen naval base|Holmen]] were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]].<ref name="K.C3.B8benhavns_historie_1728-1914">{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavns_historie_1728-1914 |title=Københavns historie 1728-1914|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|date=|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefitted from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of [[Højbro Plads]] while [[Nytorv]] and [[Gammel Torv]] were converged.<ref name="Københavns historie 1728-1914">[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavns_historie_1728-1914 "Københavns historie 1728-1914"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 14 November 2013.</ref>

===19th century===
On 2 April 1801 a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fleet under the command of [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Admiral Sir Hyde Parker]] defeated a [[Denmark–Norway|Danish-Norwegian]] [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|fleet]] anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] led the main attack. {{Sfn|Nelson|2005|p=247}} He famously disobeyed Parker's order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed.{{sfn|Cowie|1990|p=130}} Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].{{Sfn|Pocock|1994|p=229}} It was during this battle that Lord Nelson famously "put the telescope to the blind eye" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to [[Ceasefire|cease fire]].<ref name="TimesOnline">{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article2372230.ece|title=Copenhagen's second battle remembered – 200 years on |work=The Times |first=Peter|last=Davies|date=3 September 2007}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Second Battle of Copenhagen]] (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August – 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a [[preemptive war|preemptive attack]] on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population in order to seize the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|Dano-Norwegian fleet]].{{Sfn|Smith|1998|p=204}} But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary [[Congreve rocket]]s (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, ''[[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Vor frue kirke]]'', was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle was the first [[Terrorism|terror attack]] against a major European city in modern times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishbattles.com/waterloo/battle-copenhagen.htm |title=The Battle of Copenhagen|publisher=BritishBattles.com|date=|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/K%C3%B8benhavns_bombardement?highlight=K%C3%B8benhavns%20bombardement|title=Københavns bombardement|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|date=|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Despite the disasters of the early 19th century, Copenhagen experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the [[Danish Golden Age]]. Painting prospered under [[C.W. Eckersberg]] and his students while [[C.F. Hansen]] and [[Gottlieb Bindesbøll]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to the city's architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guldalder.dk/|title=Guide til Dansk Guldalder|publisher=Golden Days|date=|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> In the early 1850s, the ramparts of the city were opened to allow new housing to be built around [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|The Lakes]] ({{lang-da|Søerne}}) that bordered the old defences to the west. By the 1880s, the districts of [[Nørrebro]] and [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] developed to accommodate those who came from the provinces to participate in the city's industrialization. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad [[sanitation]] in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the [[Freeport of Copenhagen]] 1892-94.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavns_Havn|title=Københavns Havn|work=Den Store Danske |language=Danish |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>  Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The spread of housing to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population. In 1840, Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 120,000 people. By 1901, it had some 400,000 inhabitants.<ref name="Københavns historie 1728-1914"/>

===20th century===
By the beginning of the 20th century, Copenhagen has become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new [[Copenhagen City Hall|city hall]] and [[Copenhagen Central Station|railway station]], its centre was drawn towards the west.<ref name="Københavns historie 1728-1914"/> New housing developments grew up in [[Brønshøj]] and [[Valby]] while [[Frederiksberg]] became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/Frederiksberg_Kommune/Frederiksberg_Kommune_(Historie)|title=Frederiksberg Kommune - historie|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|date=|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> The northern part of [[Amager]] and [[Valby]] were also incorporated into the City of Copenhagen in 1901-02.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/khsd/1900/1900.html|author=Steffen Linvald|title=Københavns hvornår skete det|publisher=København: københavnshistorie.dk|year=1979|accessdate=24 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref>

As a result of Denmark's neutrality in the [[First World War]], Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/monumenter/artikel.aspx?xid=denmark_and_southern_jutland |author=Jan Baltzersen|title=Denmark and Southern Jutland during the First World War|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|date=|accessdate= November 2013|language=}}</ref>

In the 1920s there were serious shortages of goods and housing, and plans were made to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and rid of the worst of the city's slum areas.{{sfn|Schaldemose|2005|p=161}} However, it wasn't until the 1930s that substantial developments of apartment blocks and houses occurred,<ref name="Københavns historie siden 1914">{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn_-_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie_siden_1914?highlight=k%C3%B8benhavns%20historie |title=Københavns historie siden 1914|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|date=|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> with the tearing down of one side of the Torvegade to build five large blocks of flats.{{sfn|Schaldemose|2005|p=161}}

During [[World War II]], Copenhagen was [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied by German troops]] along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. The occupation was not a part of the Nazi German expansion, and in the first years German authorities wanted a kind of understanding with the Danish government. Even a general parliamentary election was granted in 1943, with only the [[Communist Party of Denmark|Communist Party]] excluded. But in August 1943, when the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were [[scuttling|scuttled]] in Copenhagen Harbour by the [[Royal Danish Navy]] to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|started to arrest Jews]], although many managed to escape to [[Sweden]].<ref name=occupation>{{cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/en/society/history/occupation/|title=The Occupation of Denmark|publisher=Denmark.dk|date=|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

After the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]] the Germans feared that the Danish police could become a problem, and in early September 1944 the entire Danish police force was meant to be arrested. But a majority of them managed either to hide or escape to Sweden. Out of 2,000 policemen captured and deported to Germany fewer than half returned after the war. During the last eight months of occupation Copenhagen suffered a high rate of common criminality as a result.<ref name=occupation/>

Ole Lippman, the leader of the [[Special Operations Executive|Danish resistance movement (SOE)]], asked for [[RAF]] assistance in attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, [[Air vice-marshal|Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Basil Embry|Sir Basil Embry]] drew the plans for a spectacular precision attack on the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] and [[Gestapo]] building, the former office of the [[Shell Oil Company]]. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building. The attack came on 22 March 1945, coming in three small waves. All six planes (carrying one bomb each) in the first wave hit their target, but unfortunately one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg girls school. Due to this crash four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the military target, and aimed their bombs at the school. 123 civilians (of which 87 were young girls) were killed.<ref name="milhist.dk">{{cite web|url=http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/shell/shell.html |title=The Bombing of the Shellhus on March 21, 1945 |publisher=Dansk Militærhistorie |date=21 March 1945 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> However from the Shell-building, 18 of a total of 26 political prisoners managed to escape, the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed.<ref name="milhist.dk"/>

;Post-war decades:
[[File:SHL - Black Diamond.jpg|thumb|left|The Black Diamond (1999)]]
Shortly after the end of the war, an innovative urban development project known as the [[Finger Plan]] was introduced in 1947, encouraging the creation of new housing and businesses interspersed with large green areas along five "fingers" stretching out from the city centre along the [[S-train]] routes.<ref name="OECD2010">{{cite book|title=Regional Development Policies in OECD Countries|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3SK4Pg3zEHUC&pg=PA357|date=4 November 2010|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-08722-4|page=357}}</ref>{{sfn|Cervero|1998|p=132}} With the expansion of the welfare state and women entering the work force, schools, nurseries, sports facilities and hospitals were established across the city.

[[File:Bridge over Øresund.jpg|thumb|Øresund Bridge (1999)]]
Motor traffic in the city grew significantly and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect [[Jan Gehl]], pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/%E2%80%98copenhagenizing%E2%80%99-world-one-city-time|author=Elise Beacom|title='Copenhagenizing' the world, one city at a time|publisher=''the Copenhagen post''|date=10 November 2012|accessdate=24 November 2013 |language=}}</ref> Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with the closure of the Holmen naval base.

===2000 to present===
[[File:Copenaghen Opera House.jpg|thumb|left|Copenhagen Opera House (2004)]]
Since the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of [[Malmö]] have been connected by a toll bridge/tunnel ([[Øresund Bridge]]), which carries railway and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area which spans both nations. The construction of the bridge has led to many changes to the public [[transport network|transport system]] and extensive redevelopment of [[Amager]], south of Copenhagen.<ref name=kkkh/> The city's service and trade sectors have developed while a number of banking and financial institutions have been established. Educational institutions have also gained importance, especially the [[University of Copenhagen]] with its 35,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/koebenhavn/|title=København|publisher=Danmarkshistorien.dk|date=|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Another important development for the city was the [[Copenhagen Metro]], the underground railway system opened in 2000 with additions up to 2007, transporting some 54 million passengers by 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/copenhagen/|title=Copenhagen Metro, Denmark|publisher=railwaytechnology.com|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=}}</ref>

[[File:Copenhagen skyline.jpg|thumb|right|Skyline of the old city core of Copenhagen.]]
[[File:Copenhagen 12.57744E 55.66605N.jpg|thumb|Satellite view]]
Copenhagen is part of the [[Øresund Region]], which consists of Zealand, [[Lolland-Falster]] and [[Bornholm]] in Denmark and [[Scania]] in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oresundsregionen.org/en/about-the-oeresund-region|title=What is the Øresund Region?|publisher=Øresund|date=|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> It is located on the eastern shore of the island of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], partly on the island of [[Amager]] and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the [[Øresund]] to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from [[Sweden]], and which connects the [[North Sea]] with the [[Baltic Sea]]. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] towns of [[Malmö]] and [[Landskrona]] lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/travel/copenhagen-19.html|title=Copenhagen (København), Denmark|publisher=Danishnet.com|date=|accessdate=16 November 2013|language=}}</ref> By road, Copenhagen is {{convert|42.3|km}} northwest of [[Malmö]], Sweden, {{convert|85.5|km}} northeast of [[Næstved]], {{convert|164|km}} northeast of [[Odense]], {{convert|295|km}} east of [[Esbjerg]] and {{convert|188|km}} southeast of [[Aarhus]] by sea and road via [[Sjaellands Odde]].<ref>{{Google maps | url =https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Copenhagen&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF-8&ei=USGSUuWnH_KA7QaTz4CYBA&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg  | accessdate =24 November 2013}}</ref>

The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old ramparts that are still referred to as the [[Fortification Ring, Copenhagen|Fortification Ring]] (''Fæstningsringen'') and kept as a partial green band around it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/parker/indre-by|title=Parker I Indre By|language=Danish|publisher=Copenhagen Municipality|accessdate=2013-11-25}}</ref>  Then come the late 19th and early 20th century residential neighbourhoods of [[Østerbro]], [[Nørrebro]], [[Vesterbro]] and [[Amagerbro]]. The outlying areas of [[Kongens Enghave]], [[Valby]], [[Vigerslev]], [[Vanløse]], [[Brønshøj]], [[Utterslev]] and [[Sundby, Copenhagen|Sundby]] followed from 1920 to 1960. They consist mainly of residential housing and apartments often enhanced with parks and greenery.<ref name=kgdsd/>

===Topography===
The central area of the city consists of relatively low-lying flat ground formed by [[moraine]]s from the last ice age while the hilly areas to the north and west frequently rise to {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The slopes of [[Valby]] and [[Brønshøj]] reach heights of over {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}}, divided by valleys running from the northeast to the southwest. Close to the centre are the [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|Copenhagen lakes]] of Sortedams Sø, Peblinge Sø and Sankt Jørgens Sø.<ref name=kgdsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn_-_geografi|title=København - geografi|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|date=|accessdate=16 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Copenhagen rests on a subsoil of flint-layered limestone deposited in the [[Danian]] period some 60 to 65 million years ago. Some [[greensand]] from the [[Selandian]] is also present. There are a few faults in the area, the most important of which is the Carlsberg fault which runs northwest to southeast through the centre of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocenter.dk/xpdf/geoviden-4-2005.pdf|author=Lars Nielsen, Alexander Lassen, Hans Thybo|title=Carlsbergforkastningen|publisher=''Geoviden''|issue=4|pages=8–11|year=2005|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> During the last ice age, glaciers eroded the surface leaving a layer of moraines up to {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} thick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_(Geologi)|title=København - geologi|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|date=|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

===Beaches===
[[File:Amager Strandpark - kite surfers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Amager Strandpark]]]]
Copenhagen and the surrounding areas have 3 beaches with a total of approx. {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=off}} of sandy beaches within 30 minutes cycling from the city centre. This includes [[Amager Strandpark]], which opened in 2005 and includes a {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} long artificial island and a total of {{convert|4.6|km|1|abbr=on}} of beaches, located just 15 minutes by bicycle or a few minutes by metro from the city centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amager-strand.dk/content/stranden|title=Stranden|publisher=Amagerstrand|accessdate=21 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

The beaches are supplemented by a system of [[Copenhagen Harbour Baths|Harbour Baths]] along the Copenhagen waterfront. The first and most popular of these is located at [[Islands Brygge]] and has won international acclaim for its design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture-page.com/go/people/profiles/bjarke-ingels-group|title=2007 IOC Honorable Mention|publisher=ap architecture-page|accessdate=5 January 2009}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Frederiksberg Palace from above (winter).JPG|thumb|Frederiksberg Palace in the snow]]
Copenhagen is in the [[oceanic climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb&#x202f;'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Denmark.htm|title=Denmark|publisher=Weather Online|date=|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=}}</ref> Copenhagen's weather is subject to [[low pressure area|low-pressure systems]] from the Atlantic which result in unstable weather throughout the year. The [[Gulf Stream]] brings warmer water across from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] causing average temperatures to be some 5 degrees higher than would be expected for the city's latitude of 55 degrees North. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While there can be snow from late December to early March, there can also be rain with average temperatures around freezing point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,copenhagen,Denmark|title=Average weather in Copenhagen, Denmark|publisher=World Weather and Climate Information|date=|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a day. July and August are warm too with daytime temperatures around {{convert|20|°C|0}} although rainfall averages 69&nbsp;mm per month. By contrast, the average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with from four to six hours of sunshine per day from March to May. March is the driest month of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Copenhagen-weather-averages/Hovedstaden/DK.aspx|title=Copenhagen Weather, Denmark Weather Averages|publisher=World Weather Online|date=|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50&nbsp;cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24 hour period during the winter months<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/CPH/DK/MAIN/Foer+afrejse/Vejr+og+flyvning/Kl%C3%A6dt+p%C3%A5+til+vinteren.htm|title=Københavns Lufthavn er klædt på til vinteren|publisher=CPH|date=|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> while summer temperatures have been know to rise to heights of {{convert|33|°C|0}} (91°F).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/danmark/varmeste-dag-i-37-aar|title=Exceptionel varm sommerdag i København|publisher=''BT''|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Due to Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. In mid-summer, the sun rises at 4.28 am and sets at 9.55 pm, providing 17 hours 27 minutes of daylight. In mid-winter, it rises at 8.39 am and sets at 15.36 pm with just 6 hours 57 minutes of daylight. There is therefore a difference of about ten and a half hours in the length of days and nights between summer and winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torbenhermansen.dk/almanak/almanak.php#|title=Sol op/ned |publisher=Almanak|date=|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon neutral by 2025. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in  2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20-30 % of cars will run on electricity or [[biofuel]] by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/apr/12/copenhagen-push-carbon-neutral-2025 Copenhagen's ambitious push to be carbon-neutral by 2025] Guardian 12 April 2013</ref>

The city's architectural planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of [[Low-energy house|low-energy standards]]. Priorities here include [[Water conservation|recycling rainwater]], [[green roof]]s and efficient [[waste management]] solutions. In regard to city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kk.sites.itera.dk/apps/kk_pub2/pdf/961_BLdBaJTGzV.pdf|title=Copenhagen City of Architecture: The architecture policy of the City of Copenhagen|publisher= Technical and Environmental Administation, City of Copenhagen |year=2010|accessdate=2 December 2013 |language=}}</ref>

As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been rewarded for its [[green economy]], becoming the world's leading green city in the 2012 Global Green Economy Index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meetincopenhagen.com/news-and-events/business-news/new-green-city-survey-ranks-copenhagen-no-1|title=New green city survey ranks Copenhagen No. 1|publisher=MeetinCopenhagen|date=12 September 2012|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=}}</ref> It has also received the title of "European Green Capital 2014" as a result of its environmental record and its ambitious goals.

==Demographics and society==
[[File:Christiansborg, Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|[[Christiansborg Palace]] which seats the [[Danish Parliament]], the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Danish Prime Minister's Office]] and the [[Supreme Court of Denmark|Danish Supreme Court]].]]
As of 2012, 77.8% of Copenhagen's population is [[Danes|Danish]], 7.5% are immigrants from Western countries and 14.6% of a non-Western background.<ref name=osf/>

===Population===
Depending on the boundaries used, the population of Copenhagen differs. [[Statistics Denmark]] uses a measure of the contiguously built-up urban area of Copenhagen. As a result, the number of communities included in this statistical abstract has changed several times, with about 1.21 million (1,213,822 (2012)) inhabitants. Statistics Denmark has never specified the geographical area of urban Copenhagen. However, we know it consists of [[Copenhagen Municipality]], [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]] and 16 of the 20 municipalities in the old counties [[Copenhagen County|Copenhagen]] and [[Roskilde County|Roskilde]], though five of them only partially.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/Nyt/2007/NR415.pdf|publisher=Danmarks Statistik|title=Byopgørelse 1. januar 2007 (Largest cities of Denmark 2007)|language=Danish|accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref>

The urban area of Copenhagen counts 1,230,728 inhabitants (2013) and the metropolitan area 1,937,611 (2012). The latter is equivalent to the local traffic area and ticket fare zones, covering {{convert|3030|km2|0|abbr=off}}.{{sfn|Brebbia|2013|p=24}}

Based on a 10%-isoline (data from 2002) in which at least 10% commutes into central parts of the Copenhagen area, most of Zealand would be covered and this area has a population of about 2.3&nbsp;million inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bvl.aau.dk/dansk/fase1/plancher/pendler_hreg.jpg |title=Andel af befolkningen der pendler til den centrale del a HUR-området |date= |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

Since the opening of the Øresund Bridge in 2000, commuting between and integration of Zealand and Scania have increased rather rapidly. Known as the Øresund Region, it has 3.8 million inhabitants (of which 2.5 million live in the Danish part of the region).<ref>http://www.orestat.se/ diagram top left shows Danish and Swedish population within the Øresund Region and under top left diagram "''Indbyggertal''" which means "inhabitants" (3.8 million)</ref>

===Religion===
{{See also|Religion in Denmark}}
The majority of those living in Copenhagen are members of the Lutheran [[Church of Denmark]]. However as of 1 January 2013, at 61.6%, the percentage of the population specifically confirming their membership by paying church taxes is well below the national average of 79.1%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miliki.dk/kirke/statistik/folkekirkens-medlemstal/|title=Medlemmer af folkekirken|publisher=Ministeriet for Ligestilling og Kirke|accessdate=26 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> There are also several other Christian communities in the city, of which the largest is [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.katolsk.dk/fileadmin/katolsk/User_oploads/dokumenter_bispekontoret/Noegletal_2010_Sogneoekonomi.pdf|title=Nøgletal for sognene|publisher=Katolsk.dk|accessdate=26 November 2013 |language=}}</ref> The second most important religion practised in the city is [[Islam]].

===Quality of living===
For a number of years, Copenhagen has ranked high in international surveys for its quality of life. Its stable economy together with its education services and level of social safety make it attractive for locals and visitors alike. Although it is one of the world's most expensive cities, it is also one of the most liveable with its public transport, facilities for cyclists and its environmental policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20110906-living-in-copenhagen|author=Sunshine Flint|title=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20110906-living-in-copenhagen|publisher=BBC|date=September 2011|accessdate=30 November 2013 |language=}}</ref> In elevating Copenhagen to "most liveable city" in 2013, ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'' pointed to its open spaces, increasing activity on the streets, city planning in favour of cyclists and pedestrians, and features to encourage inhabitants to enjoy city life with an emphasis on community, culture and cuisine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://monocle.com/film/affairs/most-liveable-city-copenhagen/|title=Most liveable city: Copenhagen|publisher=''Monocle''|accessdate=30 November 2013 |language=}}</ref> Other sources have ranked Copenhagen high for its business environment, accessibility, restaurants and environmental planning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/prestigious-titles-and-rankings-copenhagen|title=Prestigious titles and rankings to Copenhagen|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|date=6 September 2013|accessdate=30 November 2013 |language=}}</ref> For students, however, Copenhagen ranks only No. 39 for student friendliness in 2012 while Stockholm was rated No. 27.

==Cityscape==
The city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, the many parks, and the [[Segregated cycle facilities|bicycle paths]] that line most streets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.dk/da/koebenhavn/arkitektur/koebenhavns-forskellige-bydele|title=Københavns forskellige bydele|publisher=Visit Denmark|accessdate=18 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Sometimes referred to as "the City of Spires", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, only broken by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the [[Baroque]] spire of the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Danske_kirker/Vor_Frelsers_Kirke|title=Vor Frelsers Kirke (København)|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=21 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> Other important spires are those of [[Christiansborg Palace]], the [[Copenhagen City Hall|City Hall]] and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a [[modern art]] venue. A bit lower are the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] spires of [[Rosenborg Castle]] and the "dragon spire" of [[Børsen|Christian IV's former stock exchange]], so named because it resembles the tails of four dragons twined together.<ref>{{cite book|author=Knud Kapper Hansen|title=Tårne, spir og kupler: om Københavns og Frederiksbergs karakteristiske tårnlandskab|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F5hqGQAACAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Tårngruppen}}</ref>

For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects from international star architects. At the same time, a number of Danish architects have achieved success in Copenhagen and abroad. Buildings in Copenhagen have won [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA European Awards]] four years in a row ("Sampension" in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/awards/riba_awards_2005.htm|title=RIBA European Awards 2005|publisher=RIBA}}</ref> "Kilen" in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/2006/Kilen/KilenDenmark.aspx|title=RIBA European Awards 2006|publisher=RIBA}}</ref> "Tietgenkollegiet" in 2007 and the [[Royal Danish Playhouse|Royal Playhouse]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/2008/RoyalPlayhouse.aspx|title=RIBA European Awards 2009|publisher=RIBA}}</ref>) The last three are all by [[Lundgaard & Tranberg|Lundgaard & Tranberg Architects]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ltarkitekter.dk/ |title=Lundgaard & Tranberg Architects |publisher=Ltarkitekter.dk |date= |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> At the 2008 [[World Architecture Festival]] in Barcelona, [[Bjarke Ingels|Bjarke Ingels Group]] won an award for the World's Best Residential Building 2008 for a house in Ørestad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturefestival.com/news-detail.cfm?newsId=33|title=World's Best Residential Building 2008|publisher=World Architecture Festival}}</ref> The Forum AID Award for Best building in Scandinavia went to Copenhagen buildings both in 2006 and 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designboom.com/weblog/read.php?CATEGORY_PK=&TOPIC_PK=2388|title=Ørestad Gymnasium Best Building in Scandinavia 2008|publisher=designboom}}</ref> In 2008 British design magazine ''[[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle]]'' named Copenhagen the ''World's best design city 2008''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/copenhagen-probably-the-best-city-in-the-world-842782.html|title=World's best design city 2008|work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Emily|last=Dugan|date=9 June 2008}}</ref>

The boom in [[urban planning|urban development]] and [[modern architecture]] has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. [[Ørestad]] now has seen most of the recent development. Located near [[Copenhagen Airport]], it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the [[IT University of Copenhagen|IT University]] and a high school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orestad.dk/~/media/Orestad/pdf/Copenhagen-Growing_web.ashx|title=Copenhagen growing|publisher=''By&Havn''|accessdate=21 November 2013|language=}}</ref>

In Copenhagen, many [[cemetery|cemeteries]] double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]], the burial place of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], is an important green space for the district of [[Nørrebro|Inner Nørrebro]] and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known [[Vestre Cemetery|Vestre Kirkegaard]] is the largest (54&nbsp;hectares) cemetery in Denmark and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown [[tomb]]s, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other [[List of garden features|garden feature]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde|title=Kirkegårde|publisher=Københavns Kommune|language=Danish|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>

===Landmarks by district===
[[File:Christianshavns Kanal boats.jpg|thumb|left|Christianshavn Canal]]

====Indre By====
The historic centre of the city, [[Indre By]] or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as [[Frederiksstaden]] developed by [[Frederik V of Denmark|Frederik V]] in the second half of the 18th century in the [[Rococo]] style has the four mansions of [[Amalienborg]], the royal residence, and the wide-domed [[Frederik's Church|Marble Church]] at its centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie/Frederiksstaden|title=Frederiksstaden|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed [[Copenhagen Opera]] stands on the island of [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Holmen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktalink.dk/titelliste/open|author=Charlotte Haase, Susanne Nørgaard|title=Operaen|publisher=Faktalink|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> To the south of Frederiksstaden, the [[Nyhavn]] canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th century, many now with lively restaurants and bars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenet.dk/cph-map/cph-nyhavn.asp|title=Nyhavn|publisher=Copenhagenet.dk|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=}}</ref> The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of [[Kongens Nytorv]] which was laid out by [[Christian V]] in 1670. Important buildings include [[Charlottenborg Palace]], famous for its art exhibitions, the [[Embassy of France, Copenhagen|Thott Palace]] (now the French embassy), the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] and the [[Hotel D'Angleterre]], dated to 1755.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/kings-new-square-gdk428111|title=King's New Square|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=}}</ref> Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of [[Christiansborg]], the [[Copenhagen City Hall|City Hall]] and [[Rundetårn]], originally an observatory.

====Christianshavn====
[[File:Halmtorvet seen from Øksnehallen.jpg|thumb|Halmtorvet in Vesterbro]]
[[Christianshavn]] lies to the southeast of Indre By on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of [[Amsterdam]], he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its [[Christianshavns Vold|ramparts]] which are still well preserved today.<ref name=kher/> The canals themselves, branching off the central [[Christianshavns Kanal|Christianshavn Canal]] and  lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions. Another interesting feature is [[Freetown Christiania]], a fairly large area of landing occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971 and still maintaining a level of autonomy. The inhabitants openly sell drugs on "Pusher Street" as well as their arts and crafts. Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] with its spiralling steeple, the magnificent Rococo [[Christian's Church, Copenhagen|Christian's Church]], and the [[North Atlantic House]] which now displays culture from Iceland and Greenland and houses the [[Noma (restaurant)|Noma]] restaurant, known for its Nordic cuisine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/maritime-christianshavn-holmen|title=Maritime Christianshavn & Holmen|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byliv/guide-to-christianshavn|title=Guide to Christianshavn|publisher=AOK|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=}}</ref>

====Nørrebro====
[[File:Gefion fountain, Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|The Gefion Fountain]]
[[Nørrebro]] to the northwest of the city centre has recently developed from a working-class district into a colourful cosmopolitan area with antique shops and ethnic food stores and restaurants. Much of the activity is centred around [[Sankt Hans Torv]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byliv/guide-to-noerrebro|title=Guide to: Nørrebro|publisher=AOK|accessdate=28 November 2013 |language=}}</ref>  Copenhagen's historic cemetery, [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Kirkegård]] half way up Nørrebrogade, is the resting place of many famous figures including [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]] but is also used by locals as a park and recreation area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde/assistens-kirkegaard|title=Assistens Kirkegård |publisher=Københavns Kommune|accessdate=28 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref>
