{{Politics of Cameroon}}
The '''politics of Cameroon''' takes place in a framework of a [[unitary republic|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Cameroon]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[National Assembly of Cameroon]].

==Political background==
The government adopted legislation in 1990 to authorize the formation of multiple [[political party|political parties]] and ease restrictions on forming animalistic associations and private newspapers. Cameroon' s first multiparty legislative and presidential elections were held in 1992 followed by [[municipal]] elections in 1996 and another round of legislative and presidential elections in 1997. Because the government refused to consider opposition demands for an independent election commission, the three major opposition parties boycotted the October 1997 presidential election, which Biya easily won. The leader of one of the opposition parties, [[Bello Bouba Maigari]] of the [[NUDP]], subsequently joined the government.

Cameroon has a number of independent newspapers. [[Censorship]] was abolished in 1996, but the government sometimes seizes or suspends newspapers and occasionally arrests [[journalist]]s. Although a 1990 law authorizes private radio and television stations, the government has not granted any licenses as of March 1998.

The Cameroonian Government's [[human rights]] record has been improving over the years but remains flawed. There continue to be reported abuses, including beatings of detainees, arbitrary arrests, and illegal searches. The judiciary is frequently corrupt, inefficient, and subject to political influence.<ref>[http://report.globalintegrity.org/Cameroon/2008 ''Global Integrity Report: Cameroon 2008''] Retrieved 2012-02-14.</ref>

Worthy of note is the fact that Cameroon is the only country in which two Constitutions are applicable side-by-side. For example, the 1972 Constitution designates the Prime Minister as constitutional successor of the Head of State in case of incapacity, death, resignation or unaccountable absence of the incumbent. Contrarily, the 1996 Constitutional Reform designates the President of the Senate as constitutional successor; but the Senate (provided for by 1996 Reform) does not exist. Apart from increasing the presidential mandate from 5 years to 7 years, very few amendments of the 1996 Constitutional Reform have been applied.

The 1972 [[constitution]] of the '''Republic of Cameroon''' as modified by 1996 reforms provides for a strong central government dominated by the executive. The [[Presidents of Cameroon|president]] is empowered to name and dismiss [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members (regardless of parliamentary representation), [[judge]]s, [[general]]s, provincial [[governor]]s, [[prefect]]s, [[sub-prefect]]s, and heads of Cameroon's [[parastatal]] (about 100 state-controlled) firms, obligate or disburse expenditures, approve or [[veto]] regulations, declare states of emergency, and appropriate and spend profits of parastatal firms. The president is not required to consult the National Assembly.  In 2008, a constitutional amendment was passed that eliminated term limits for president.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cameroon parliament extends Biya's term limit|date=11 April 2008|newspaper=France 24|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080411-cameroon-parliament-paul-biya-term-limit-extension|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091008042404/http://www.france24.com/en/20080411-cameroon-parliament-paul-biya-term-limit-extension|archivedate=8 October 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The judiciary is subordinate to the executive branch's [[Ministry of Justice of Cameroon|Ministry of Justice]]. The [[Supreme Court]] may review the constitutionality of a law only at the president's request.

All local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.

While the president, the minister of justice, and the president's judicial advisers (the Supreme Court) top the judicial hierarchy, traditional rulers, courts, and councils also exercise functions of government. Traditional courts still play a major role in domestic, property, and [[probate law]]. [[Tribal law]]s and customs are honored in the formal court system when not in conflict with national law. Traditional rulers receive stipends from the national government.

==Legislative branch==
The 180-member National Assembly meets in ordinary session three times a year (March/April, June/July, and November/December), and has seldom, until recently, made major changes in legislation proposed by the executive. Laws are adopted by majority vote of members present or, if the president demands a second reading, of a total membership.

Following government pledges to reform the strongly centralized 1972 constitution, the National Assembly adopted a number of amendments in December 1995 which were promulgated in January 1996. The amendments call for the establishment of a 100-member [[senate]] as part of a [[bicameral legislature]], the creation of regional councils, and the fixing of the presidential term to 7 years, renewable once. One-third of senators are to be appointed by the President, and the remaining two-thirds are to be chosen by indirect elections. As of July 2008, the government has not established the Senate or regional councils.
