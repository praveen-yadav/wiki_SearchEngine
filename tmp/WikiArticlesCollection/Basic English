'''Basic English''' is an [[English language|English]]-based  [[controlled language]] created by linguist and philosopher [[Charles Kay Ogden]] as an [[international auxiliary language]], and as an aid for teaching [[ESL|English as a Second Language]]. Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English. It was presented in Ogden's book ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930). Capitalised, ''BASIC'' is sometimes taken as an [[acronym]] that stands for ''British American Scientific International Commercial''.<ref>Brutt-Griffler, Evans Davies, English and Ethnicity, Palgrave Macmillan, 2006</ref>

Ogden's Basic, and the concept of a simplified English, gained its greatest publicity just after the Allied victory in the [[Second World War]] as a means for world peace. Although Basic English was not built into a program, similar simplifications have been devised for various international uses. Ogden's associate [[I. A. Richards]] promoted its use in schools in China.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886748,00.html Time Magazine. Dec. 31, 1945. ''Education: Globalingo'']</ref> More recently, it has influenced the creation of [[Voice of America]]'s [[Special English]] for news broadcasting, and [[Simplified English]], another English-based controlled language designed to write technical manuals.

What survives today of Ogden's Basic English is the basic 850-word list used as the beginner's vocabulary of the English language taught worldwide, especially in [[Asia]].<ref>Edmond H Weiss ''The Elements of International English Style'', pp. 17-18, M. E. Sharpe, 2005 ISBN 978-0-7656-1572-5</ref>

== Design principles ==
Ogden tried to simplify English while keeping it normal for native speakers, by specifying grammar restrictions and a controlled small vocabulary which makes an extensive use of [[Paraphrase|paraphrasis]]. Most notably, Ogden allowed only 18 verbs, which he called "operators".  His ''General Introduction'' says "There are no 'verbs' in Basic English", with the underlying assumption that, as noun use in English is very straightforward but verb use/conjugation is not, the elimination of verbs would be a welcome simplification.<ref>A good summary in Bill Templer: ''Towards a People's English: Back to BASIC in EIL'' [http://www.hltmag.co.uk/sep05/mart05.htm#C5 Humanising Language Teaching].</ref>

== Word lists ==
Ogden's word lists include only word roots, which in practice are extended with the defined set of affixes and the full set of forms allowed for any available word (noun, pronoun, or the limited set of verbs).<ref>See [http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordthere.html the list of words which are assumed and not counted] for details.</ref>

The 850 core words of Basic English are found in Wiktionary's [[wikt:Appendix:Basic English word list|Basic English word list]]. This core is theoretically enough for everyday life. However, Ogden prescribed that any student should learn an additional 150-word list for everyday work in some particular field, by adding a list of 100 words particularly useful in a general field (e.g., science, verse, business, etc.), along with a 50-word list from a more specialised subset of that general field, to make a [[wikt:Appendix:1000 basic English words|basic 1000-word]] vocabulary for everyday work and life.

Moreover, Ogden assumed that any student already should be familiar with (and thus may only review) a core subset of around 200 "international" words.<ref>[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpi.html Ogden's "International Word" List - Alphabetic]</ref> Therefore, a first-level student should graduate with a core vocabulary of around 1200 words. A realistic general core vocabulary could contain 2000 words (the core 850 words, plus 200 international words, and 1000 words for the general fields of trade, economics, and science). It is enough for a "standard" English level.<ref>[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpn.html Ogden's Basic English Next Steps]</ref><ref>[http://ogden.basic-english.org/word2000.html Ogden's Basic English Combined Word Lists]</ref> This 2000 words vocabulary represents "what any learner should know". At this level students could start to move on their own.

== Rules ==
''See also: [[:simple:Wikipedia:Basic English ordered wordlist|Basic English ordered wordlist]] from [[Wikipedia:Simple English Wikipedia|Simple English Wikipedia]].''

The [[grammar|word use]] of Basic English is similar to full English, but the rules are much simpler, and there are fewer [[wikt:exception|exceptions]]. Not all meanings of each word are allowed.

Ogden's rules of [[grammar]] for Basic English help people use the 850 words to talk about things and events in a normal way.<ref>{{cite web | title = Rules of Grammar | url = http://ogden.basic-english.org/rules.html | date = 1 January 1996 | accessdate = 2009-07-28 }}</ref>

*Form plurals by appending an "S" on the end of the word. Where special rules are normally necessary, such as using "ES" or "IES", use them.
*There are two word endings to change each of the 150 adjectives:  "-ER" and "-EST".
*There are two word endings to change the verb word endings, "-ING" and "-ED".
*Form adverbs from qualifiers by adding "-LY".
*Talk about amounts with "MORE" and "MOST".  Use and know "-ER" and "-EST".
*Give adjectives a negative meaning with "UN-"
*Form questions with the opposite word order, and with "DO".
*Operators and pronouns [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] as in normal English.
*Make [[:simple:Wikipedia:Basic English compound wordlist|combined words]] ([[compound word|compound]]s) from two nouns (for example "milkman") or a noun and a directive ("sundown").
*Measures, numbers, money, days, months, years, clock time, and international words are in English forms, e.g. Date/Time: 20 May 1972 at 21:00
*Where necessary, technical expressions or other terms required for the task at hand may be used and take on their local form.

== Criticism ==
Like all [[international auxiliary language]]s (or IALs), Basic English may be criticised as inevitably based on personal preferences, and thus, paradoxically, inherently divisive.<ref>Rick Harrison, ''[http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html Farewell to Auxiliary Languages]''</ref> Moreover, like all natural language based IALs, Basic is subject to criticism as unfairly biased towards the native speaker community.<ref>For instance, a sample quotation from [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0512A&L=AUXLANG&T=0&F=&S=&P=2560 the auxlang mailing list archives] and another from noted linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].</ref>

As a teaching aid for [[ESL|English as a Second Language]], Basic English has been criticised for the choice of the core vocabulary and for its grammatical constraints.<ref>For instance, by proponents of Essential World English. See [http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/eswldeng.htm a summary of EWE] for instance and, again, the linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].</ref>

In 1944, [[readability]] expert [[Rudolf Flesch]] published an article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', "How Basic is Basic English?" in which he claimed, "It's not basic, and it's not English." The basic complaint was that the vocabulary is too restricted, and, as a result, the text ends up being awkward and more difficult than necessary. He also notes that the words in the Basic vocabulary were arbitrarily selected, and there have been no empirical studies showing that it makes language simpler.<ref name="Flesch">Flesch, R. F. "How Basic is Basic English?" ''Harper's Magazine'', March 1944. pp. 339-343.</ref>

== Literary references ==
In the novel ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', published in 1933, [[H. G. Wells]] depicted Basic English as the [[lingua franca]] of a new elite which after a prolonged struggle succeeds in uniting the world and establishing a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]]. In the future world of Wells' vision, virtually all members of humanity know this language.

From 1942 to 1944 [[George Orwell]] was a proponent of Basic English, but in 1945 he became critical of [[universal language]]s. Basic English later inspired his use of [[Newspeak]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Illich |first=Ivan |authorlink=Ivan Illich |coauthors=Barry Sanders |title=ABC: The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind |year=1988 |publisher=[[North Point Press]] |location=[[San Francisco]] |language=[[English language]] |isbn=0-86547-291-2 |pages=109 |quote=The satirical force with which Orwell used Newspeak to serve as his portrait of one of those totalitarian ideas that he saw taking root in the minds of intellectuals everywhere can be understood only if we remember that he speaks with shame about a belief that he formerly held... From 1942 to 1944, working as a colleague of William Empson's, he produced a series of broadcasts to India written in Basic English, trying to use its programmed simplicity, as a ''Tribune'' article put it, "as a sort of corrective to the oratory of statesmen and publicists." Only during the last year of the war did he write "Politics and the English Language," insisting that the defense of English language has nothing to do with the setting up of a Standard English."}}</ref>

[[Evelyn Waugh]] criticized his own 1945 novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'', which he had previously called his magnum opus, in the preface of the 1959 reprint: "It <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[World War II]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> was a bleak period of present privation and threatening disaster — the period of [[soya beans]] and Basic English — and in consequence the book is infused with a kind of gluttony, for food and wine, for the splendours of the recent past, and for rhetorical and ornamental language which now, with a full stomach, I find distasteful."<ref>{{cite book | last=Waugh | first=Evelyn | title=Brideshead Revisited  | location=New York | publisher=Dell | origyear=1946 | year=1959}}.

In his story "[[Gulf (novella)|Gulf]]", science fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] used a [[constructed language]] called [[Speedtalk]], in which every Basic English word is replaced with a single [[phoneme]], as an appropriate means of communication for a race of genius supermen.<ref>Heinlein, Robert A., "Gulf", in ''Assignment in Eternity'', published by Signet Science Fiction (New American Library), 1953. Page 52-53: "It was possible to establish a one-to-one relationship with Basic English so that ''one phonetic symbol'' was equivalent to an entire word".</ref>
