==Postal service==
{{See also|Afghan Post|Postage stamps and postal history of Afghanistan}}
In 1870, a central [[post office]] was established at [[Bala Hissar, Kabul|Bala Hissar]] in Kabul and a post office in the capital of each province. The service was slowly being expanded over the years as more postal offices were established in each large city by 1918. Afghanistan became a member of the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1928,<ref name="BBC News">{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14806350 |title=Kabul: Streets with no names |accessdate=2011-09-30|work=BBC News|date=September 29, 2011}}</ref> and the postal administration elevated to the [[Afghan Ministry of Communications|Ministry of Communication]] in 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afghanpost.gov.af/about.htm|title=afghanpost.gov.af - About}}</ref> Civil war caused a disruption in issuing official stamps during the 1980s-90s war<ref name=fabio>{{cite web|url=http://digilander.libero.it/fabioalarici/a.html|title=Postal Authorities A}}</ref> but in 1999 postal service was operating again. Postal services to/from Kabul worked remarkably well all throughout the war years. Postal services to/from Herat resumed in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afghan-network.net/Culture/stamps.html|title=Afghanistan @ Stamps}}</ref> The Afghan government has reported to the UPU several times about illegal stamps being issued and sold in 2003 and 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upu.int/philately/en/2003/002_upu_circular_en.pdf|title=2003 UPU Circular}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upu.int/philately/en/2007/177_upu_circular_en.pdf|title=2007 UPU Circular}}</ref>

Afghanistan Post has been reorganizing the postal service in 2000s with the help of [[Pakistan Post]].<ref name=fabio/> The Afghanistan Postal commission was formed to prepare a written policy for the development of the postal sector, which will form the basis of a new postal services law governing licensing of postal services providers. The project was expected to finish by 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcit.gov.af/Documents/RunningProjects/AfghanPost.pdf|title=Afghanistan Postal commission}}</ref>

== Satellite ==
The Afghan Ministry of Communications announced that they plan to send its own [[satellite]] into space.<ref name=satellite>http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/02/17/3-firms-ready-launch-afghan-satellite</ref> The satellite will be launched at a position of 50 degrees east, due to geographical position of Afghanistan, the satellite will be able to cover Asia, Europe, Australia and Africa. According to the Afghan Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT), the geographical existence of Afghanistan is very valuable to connect all communications to this satellite.<ref name="mcit.gov.af">http://mcit.gov.af/en/Documents?DID=35</ref><ref name="tolonews.com">http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/5858-afghanistan-to-launch-its-first-space-satellite</ref><ref name="chinadaily.com.cn">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2012-04/09/content_15007116.htm</ref><ref name="guardian.co.uk">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/09/afghanistan-satellite</ref>

The satellite is expected to improve the country's television and internet coverage. In addition, it will save Afghanistan money in fees; Afghanistan currently pays around 100 million dollars a year to provide communication services.<ref>http://tolonews.com/en/6:30-report/5969-afghanistans-first-satellite</ref> Based on statistics from the MCIT, Afghanistan needs around 1,700 megabytes for its communications per year. It will take at least three years to launch the satellite, with the total cost ranging between 200 to 300 million, major international countries have shown interest in sharing the costs with the Afghan government.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/>
