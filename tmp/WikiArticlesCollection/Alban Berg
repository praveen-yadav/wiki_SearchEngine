'''Alban Maria Johannes Berg''' (February 9, 1885 – December 24, 1935) was an [[Austria]]n [[composer]]. He was a member of the [[Second Viennese School]] with [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton Webern]], and produced compositions that combined [[Gustav Mahler|Mahlerian]] [[Romantic music|Romanticism]] with a personal adaptation of Schoenberg's [[twelve-tone technique]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Berg was born in [[Vienna]], the third of four children of Johanna and Conrad Berg. His family lived comfortably until the death of his father in 1900.

===Education===
He was more interested in [[literature]] than [[music]] as a child and did not begin to compose until he was fifteen, when he started to teach himself music. In late February or early March 1902 he fathered a child with Marie Scheuchl, a servant girl in the Berg family household. His daughter, Albine, was born on December 4, 1902.

Berg had little formal music education before he became a student of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] in October 1904. With Schoenberg he studied [[counterpoint]], [[music theory]], and [[harmony]].<ref>Schoenberg, Arnold. Trans. Joe Monzo. {{Wayback|url=http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/harm/monzo-intro.htm|title="Schoenberg's Harmonielehre", ''Sonic Arts''|date=20120405095622}}</ref> By 1906, he was studying music full-time; by 1907, he began [[musical composition|composition]] lessons. His student compositions included five drafts for [[piano sonata]]s. He also wrote songs, including his ''[[Seven Early Songs (Berg)|Seven Early Songs]]'' (''Sieben Frühe Lieder''), three of which were Berg's first publicly performed work in a concert that featured the music of Schoenberg's pupils in Vienna that year. The early sonata sketches eventually culminated in Berg's [[Piano sonata (Berg)|Piano Sonata]], [[opus number|Op]]. 1 (1907–1908); it is one of the most formidable "first" works ever written.<ref>Lauder (1986)</ref>

Berg studied with Schoenberg for six years until 1911. Berg admired him as a composer and mentor, and they remained close lifelong friends.

Among Schoenberg's teaching was the idea that the unity of a musical composition depends upon all its aspects being derived from a single basic idea; this idea was later known as ''developing variation''. Berg passed this on to his students, one of whom, [[Theodor Adorno]], stated: "The main principle he conveyed was that of variation: everything was supposed to develop out of something else and yet be intrinsically different".<ref>Adorno, p. 33</ref> The Piano Sonata is an example—the whole composition is derived from the work's opening [[quartal and quintal harmony|quartal]] gesture and its opening phrase.

===Innovation===
Berg was a part of Vienna's cultural elite during the heady ''[[fin de siècle]]'' period. His circle included the musicians [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] and [[Franz Schreker]], the painter [[Gustav Klimt]], the writer and satirist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], the architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the poet [[Peter Altenberg]]. In 1906, Berg met the singer Helene Nahowski, daughter of a wealthy family (said by some to be in fact the illegitimate daughter of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] from his liaison with [[Anna Nahowski]]);<ref>Georg Markus, ''Der Kaiser Franz Joseph I.: Bilder und Dokumente''; Anna Nahowski and Friedrich Saathen, ''Anna Nahowski und Kaiser Franz Joseph : Aufzeichnungen / erstmalig herausgegeben und kommentiert von Friedrich Saathen'', Böhlau, 1986.</ref> despite the outward hostility of her family, the two were married on May 3, 1911.

In 1913, two of Berg's ''Five Songs on Picture Postcard Texts by Peter Altenberg'' (1912) were premièred in Vienna, [[conducting|conducted]] by Schoenberg in the infamous ''[[Skandalkonzert]]''. Settings of aphoristic poetic utterances, the songs are accompanied by a very large orchestra. The performance caused a riot, and had to be halted. This was a crippling blow to Berg's self-confidence: he effectively withdrew the work, which is surely one of the most extraordinarily innovative and assured first orchestral compositions in the literature, and it was not performed in full until 1952. The full score remained unpublished until 1966.

From 1915 to 1918, Berg served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and during a period of leave in 1917 he accelerated work on his first [[opera]], ''[[Wozzeck]]''. After the end of [[World War I]], he settled again in Vienna where he taught private pupils. He also helped Schoenberg run his [[Society for Private Musical Performances]], which sought to create the ideal environment for the exploration and appreciation of unfamiliar new music by means of open rehearsals, repeat performances, and the exclusion of professional critics.

Berg had a particular interest in the number 23, using it to structure several works.  Various suggestions have been made as to the reason for this interest: that he took it from the [[Biorhythms]] theory of [[Wilhelm Fliess]], in which a 23 day cycle is considered significant,<ref>Jarman, D. (1983). [http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/962034?uid=3738032&uid=373072751&uid=2&uid=3&uid=60&sid=21102523353593 Alban Berg, Wilhelm Fliess and the Secret Programme of the Violin Concerto]. ''The Musical Times'' Vol. 124, No. 1682 (Apr. 1983), pp. 218-223</ref> or because he first suffered an asthma attack on 23rd of the month.<ref>Jarman, D. (1985).

Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 228-230</ref>

===Success of ''Wozzeck''===
Three excerpts from ''Wozzeck'' were performed in 1924, and this brought Berg his first public success. The opera, which Berg completed in 1922, was first performed on December 14, 1925, when [[Erich Kleiber]] directed the first performance in [[Berlin]]. Today ''Wozzeck'' is seen as one of the century's most important works. Berg completed the orchestration of only the first two acts of his later three-act opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', before he died. The first two acts were successfully premièred in Zürich in 1937, but for personal reasons Helene Berg subsequently imposed a ban on any attempt to "complete" the final act, which Berg had in fact completed in particell (short score) format. An orchestration was therefore commissioned in secret from [[Friedrich Cerha]] and premièred in Paris (under [[Pierre Boulez]]) only in 1979, soon after Helene Berg's own death. The complete opera has rapidly entered the repertoire as one of the landmarks of contemporary music and, like Wozzeck, remains a consistent audience draw.

Berg had interrupted the orchestration of ''Lulu'' because of an unexpected (and financially much-needed) commission from the Russian-American violinist Louis Krasner for a [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] (1935). This profoundly elegiac work, composed at unaccustomed speed and posthumously premièred, has become Berg's best-known and beloved composition. Like much of his mature work, it employs an idiosyncratic adaptation of Schoenberg's [[twelve-tone technique]] that enables the composer to produce passages openly evoking tonality, including quotations from historical tonal music, such as a [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] chorale and a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] folk song. The Violin Concerto was dedicated "to the memory of an Angel", [[Manon Gropius]], the deceased daughter of architect [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Alma Mahler]].

Other well-known Berg compositions include the ''[[Lyric Suite]]'' (1926), which was later shown to employ elaborate cyphers to document a secret love affair; the extraordinarily elaborate post-Mahlerian Three Pieces for Orchestra (completed in 1915 but not performed until after ''Wozzeck''); and the ''[[Kammerkonzert (Berg)|Chamber Concerto]]'' (''Kammerkonzert'', 1923–25) for [[violin]], [[piano]] and 13 [[Woodwind instrument|wind]] instruments: this latter is written so conscientiously that Pierre Boulez has called it "Berg's strictest composition" and it, too, is permeated by cyphers and posthumously disclosed hidden programs.

===Death===
Berg died in Vienna, on Christmas Eve 1935, from [[blood poisoning]] apparently caused by an insect-sting-induced [[carbuncle]] on his back.  He had been reduced to near-poverty and it is said that to save money his wife carried out an ill-advised operation using a pair of scissors.  Later he was taken to hospital, although too late to prevent the onset of blood poisoning. He was 50 years old.

==Legacy==
Berg is remembered as one of the most important composers of the 20th century and to date is the most widely performed opera composer among the [[Second Viennese School]].<ref>Jarman, Grove</ref>  He is considered to have brought more human values to the twelve-tone system, his works seen as more emotional than Schoenberg's.<ref>The Complete Book of 20th Century Music, pg.20, by David Ewen, Prentice-Hall Inc. 1963</ref> Critically he is seen to have preserved the Viennese tradition in his music.<ref>The Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians, pg.638, St. Martin's Press, Inc. 1961</ref>{{Verify source|date=September 2011}}<!--OCLC WorldCat fails to discover this title. Is this meant to be Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th edition? If so, Eric Blom should be credited as editor, and the primary publisher is Macmillan Publishers in London. Moreover, major articles in Grove 5 are signed.--> His popularity has been more easily secured than many other Modernists since he plausibly combined both Romantic and Expressionist idioms.  Though Berg's Romanticism at one time seemed a drawback for some more modernist composers,{{Weasel-inline|date=September 2011}}<!--Jarman does not say this, so who exactly are these "more modernist composers"?--> the Berg scholar Douglas Jarman writes in the [[New Grove]]: "As the 20th century closed, the 'backward-looking' Berg suddenly came as [George] [[George Perle|Perle]] remarked, to look like its most forward-looking composer."<ref>Jarman, Grove</ref>
