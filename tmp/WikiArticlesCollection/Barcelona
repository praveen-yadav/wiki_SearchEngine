Founded as a Roman city, Barcelona became the capital of the [[Counts of Barcelona|County of Barcelona]]. After merging with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], Barcelona continued to be an important city in the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Besieged several times during its history, Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]], which have been designated UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The headquarters of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] is located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] as well as world-class [[Barcelona#Trade fair and exhibitions|conferences and expositions]] and also many [[Sport in Barcelona#International tournaments|international sport tournaments]].

Barcelona is today one of the world's leading tourist, economic, trade fair/exhibitions and cultural-sports centres, and its influence in commerce, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the [[global city|world's major global cities]].<ref name=GAWC>{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |title=The World According to GaWC 2010 |publisher=Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network, [[Loughborough University]] |accessdate=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |title=Inventory of World Cities |publisher=Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group and Network |accessdate=1 December 2007}}</ref> It is a major cultural and economic centre in southwestern Europe ([[Iberian Peninsula]]), 24th in the world (after [[Zürich]], before [[Frankfurt]])<ref>[http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a 2012 Global Cities Index]</ref> and a growing financial centre ([[Diagonal Mar]] and [[Gran Via (Barcelona)|Gran Via]]).

==Names==
The name ''Barcelona'' comes from the ancient Iberian [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''Barkeno'', attested in an ancient coin inscription in [[Iberian scripts|Iberian script]] as [[File:Barkeno.png|34px|Barkeno in Levantine Iberian script]],<ref>''Emerita: Revista de Lingüística y Filología clasica'' 11 (1943), p.468</ref> in [[Ancient Greek]] sources as {{lang|grc|Βαρκινών}}, ''Barkinṓn'';<ref>[[Ptolemy]], ii. 6. §&nbsp;8</ref> and in [[Latin]] as ''Barcino''{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, ''Barcilonum''<ref>[[Rufus Festus Avienus]] ''Ora Maritima'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/avienus.ora.html « et Barcilonum amoena sedes ditium. » v514]</ref> and ''Barceno''.<ref>[[Antonine Itinerary|Itin. Ant.]]</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

During [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], the city was variously known as ''Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa'', and ''Barchenona''.

Some sources say that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general [[Hamilcar Barca]], who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Barcelona |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>

Barcelona's name is sometimes abbreviated as 'Barna'. Nowadays, foreign people sometimes mistakenly refer to Barcelona as 'Barça', the popular name of the F.C. Barcelona sports club. Some people (mainly in Spanish/Catalan) also use 'BCN', often written 'Bcn', which actually corresponds to the [[IATA airport code]] of the [[Barcelona-El Prat Airport]]. The city is also referred to as the "ciudad condal" in Spanish and "ciutat comtal" in Catalan, owing to its past as home to the [[Count of Barcelona]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Barcelona}}
The founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city to the mythological [[Hercules]]. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] [[Hamilcar Barca]], father of [[Hannibal]], who named the city ''Barcino'' after his family in the 3rd century BC.<ref>Oros. vii. 143; Miñano, ''Diccion.'' vol.&nbsp;i. p.&nbsp;391; Auson. ''Epist.'' xxiv. 68, 69, ''Punica Barcino''.</ref>

In about [[15 BC|15&nbsp;BC]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] redrew the town as a ''[[castra|castrum]]'' (Roman military camp) centred on the "''Mons Taber''", a little hill near the contemporary city hall ([[Plaça de Sant Jaume]]). Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of ''Faventia'',<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] iii. 3. s.&nbsp;4</ref> or, in full, ''Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino''<ref>Inscr. ap. Gruter, p. 426, nos. 5, 6.</ref> or ''Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino''. [[Pomponius Mela]]<ref>ii. 6</ref> mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour ''[[Tarragona|Tarraco]]'' (modern [[Tarragona]]), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.<ref>Avien. ''Ora Maritima.'' 520: "Et Barcilonum amoena sedes ditium."</ref> It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.<ref>Paul. Dig. 1. tit. 15, de Cens.</ref> The city minted its own coins; some from the era of [[Galba]] survive.
[[File:Basílica de la Mercè es del carrer d'en Carabassa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Basilica of La Mercè (Mare de Déu de la Mercè)]]
Some important Roman ruins are exposed under the [[Plaça del Rei]], its entrance located by the city museum (''[[Museu d'Història de la Ciutat]]''); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' ("Gothic Quarter"). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/spain/barcelona/walls/walls.html |title=Roman walls, Barcelona |publisher=Bluffton.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> The cathedral, also known as the Basilica ''La Seu'', is said to have been founded in 343. The city was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all [[Hispania]]. After being conquered by the [[Arabs]] in the early 8th century, it was conquered in 801 by [[Charlemagne]]'s son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian "[[Marca Hispanica|Hispanic March]]" (''Marca Hispanica''), a [[buffer zone]] ruled by the [[Counts of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]].

The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include all of [[Catalonia]]. In 1137, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[Counts of Barcelona|County of Barcelona]] merged in [[dynastic union]]<ref name="bisson_31">{{cite book |title=The medieval Crown of Aragon.

His territories were later to be known as the [[Crown of Aragon]], which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] with outlying territories [[Naples|in Naples]] and Sicily and as far as [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] in the 13th century. The forging of a dynastic link between the Crowns of Aragon and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] marked the beginning of Barcelona's decline. The Bank of Barcelona, probably the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city [[magistrate]]s in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the [[Medici Bank#Rise|Bank of Venice]] (1402) and the [[Bank of Saint George|Bank of Genoa]] (1407).<ref>The Bankers magazine, volume 11, page 595, J. Smith Homans Jr., New York 1857.</ref>

[[File:Barcelona 1563.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Barcelona in 1563]]
The marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469 united the two royal lines. [[Madrid]] became the centre of political power whilst the colonisation of the Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of Mediterranean trade. Barcelona had always been the stronghold of [[Catalan separatism]] and was the center of the [[Catalan Revolt]] (1640–52) against [[Philip IV of Spain]]. The [[Black Death|great plague]] of 1650–1654 halved the city's population.<ref>[http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm Chapter 15: A History of Spain and Portugal], Stanley G. Payne</ref>

[[File:Monjuic's castle in Barcelona.jpg|thumb|The fortress at Montjuïc, most southerly point from which measurements were made when calculating the [[History of the metre#Meridional definition|meridional definition]] of the metre]]
In the 18th century, a fortress was built at [[Montjuïc]] that overlooked the harbour. In 1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer [[Pierre Méchain|Pierre François André Méchain]] for observations relating to a survey stretching to [[Dunkirk]] that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre.<ref>{{cite book

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were "collectivised" by the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of [[anarchist]] groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939 caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[coup d'état]] was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of [[Catalonia]] were abolished,<ref>Decree of 5 April 1938.</ref> and the use of the [[Catalan language]] in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]]. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly [[Andalusia]], [[Murcia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation. Barcelona hosted the Olympic Games in 1992, which helped revitalise the city.<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/53030/Barcelona Barcelona (Spain)]". Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Barcelona ISS009-E-9987.jpg|thumb|right|Barcelona from high altitude]]
Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], facing the [[Mediterranean Sea]], on a [[plain]] approximately {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide limited by the mountain range of [[Serra de Collserola|Collserola]], the [[Llobregat]] river to the southwest and the [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]] river to the north.<ref name="gec_3">{{cite encyclopaedia |encyclopedia=Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana |title=Barcelona |year=1971 |month=July |publisher=Edicions 62 |volume=3 |location=Barcelona |pages=193–229}}</ref> This plain covers an area of {{convert|170|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},<ref name="gec_3"/> of which {{convert|101|km²|1|abbr=on}}<ref name="guies_estadistiques">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |title=11 Barcelona.indd |format=PDF |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref> are occupied by the city itself.

Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as [[El Carmel|Carmel]] (267&nbsp;m), [[Putxet]] (181&nbsp;m) and Rovira (261&nbsp;m). The escarpment of [[Montjuïc]] (173&nbsp;m), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montjuïc castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.

The city borders on the municipalities of [[Santa Coloma de Gramenet]] and [[Sant Adrià de Besòs]] to the north; the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east; [[El Prat de Llobregat]] and [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]] to the south; and [[Sant Feliu de Llobregat]], [[Sant Just Desvern]], [[Esplugues de Llobregat]], [[Sant Cugat del Vallès]], and [[Montcada i Reixac]] to the west.

[[File:Barcelona Iglesia Sagrada Familia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sagrada Família]] church, [[Antoni Gaudí|Gaudi]]'s masterpiece]]
The ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (Catalan for "Gothic Quarter") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan ''[[Modernisme|modernista]]'' architecture (related to the movement known as [[Art Nouveau]] in the rest of Europe), developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are [[World Heritage Site]]s. Especially remarkable is the work of architect [[Antoni Gaudí]], which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the [[Sagrada Família]], which has been under construction since 1882, and is still financed by private donations. As of 2007, completion is planned for 2026.

Barcelona was also home to [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s [[Barcelona Pavilion]]. Designed in 1929 for the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|International Exposition]] for Germany, it is an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms "less is more" and "God is in the details." The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure, and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.

Barcelona won the 1999 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] for its architecture,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080227000034/http://www.architecture.com/fileLibrary/pdf/Royal_Gold_Medallists_at_09112006.pdf RIBA Royal Gold Medallists]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref> the first (and as of 2012, only) time that the winner has been a city, and not an individual architect.

[[Sant Sebastià]], [[La Barceloneta, Barcelona|Barceloneta]] and [[Somorrostro]] beaches, both {{convert|1100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in length,<ref name="guies_estadistiques"/> are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona. The [[Olympic Harbour]] separates them from the other city beaches: [[Nova Icària]], [[Bogatell]], [[Mar Bella]], [[Nova Mar Bella]] and [[Llevant, Barcelona|Llevant]]. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640&nbsp;m/1,300 to 2,100&nbsp;ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline.

==Demographics==
[[File:Demografía Barcelona (España).PNG|right|300px|thumb|Demographic evolution, 1900–2007, according to the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estadística]]

In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000 people,<ref name="gec_3"/> which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 with 1,906,998 people, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher [[quality of life]] in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 people, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201010.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071221131641/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201010.htm |archivedate=21 December 2007 |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Estadística: Evolució de la població. 1900–2005 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>

===Population density===
''Note: This text is entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city council.''

Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,628,090 living in the 102.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre.

In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited [[Zona Franca (Barcelona)|Zona Franca]] industrial area and [[Montjuïc]] forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 km2 at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.

Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22,7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of [[Sagrada Família, Barcelona|la Sagrada Família]] where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.

Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the region was one of the earliest to begin industrialization in [[continental Europe]], beginning with textile-related works from the mid-1780s but really gathering momentum in the mid-19th century, when it became a major centre for the production of textiles and machinery. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.

Borsa de Barcelona (''Barcelona Stock Exchange'') is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.

The region's leading industries today are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, telecommunications and information technology services. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Fashion===
[[File:Pasarela The Brandery 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Brandery]], fashion show in Barcelona.]]
The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the prestigious [[Bread & Butter]] urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organisers announced that it would be returning to Berlin.<ref name="bread">{{cite web |title=Bread & Butter Barcelona.

==Government and administrative divisions==
{{See also|Municipal elections in Barcelona|List of mayors of Barcelona}}
[[File:Casa generalitat web.jpg|thumb|[[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya]]]]
As the capital of the autonomous community of [[Catalonia]], Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the ''[[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat de Catalunya]]''; of particular note are the [[Government of Catalonia|executive branch]], the [[Parliament of Catalonia|parliament]], and the [[Supreme Court]] of [[Catalonia]]. The city is also the capital of the [[Province of Barcelona]] and the [[Barcelonès]] [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]] (district).

Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|elected]] for a four-year term by [[universal suffrage]]. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the ''Carta Municipal'' (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.<ref name="ley 1/2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&id=2006/04583 |title=BOE – LEY 1/2006, de 13 de marzo, por la que se regula el Régimen Especial del municipio de Barcelona |publisher=Boe.es |date=14 March 2006 |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref> According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,2687,200713899_200720868_1,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona> Ajuntament> El Govern de la Ciutat |publisher=W3.bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100728231233/http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,2687,200713899_200720868_1,00.html| archivedate= 28 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.cat/catala/laciutat/barcelona/organitzacio.htm |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Organització política |publisher=Bcn.cat |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref> It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, [[road traffic safety|road safety]] and [[public safety]].

The ''Comissió de Govern'' (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the [[List of mayors of Barcelona|Mayor]], with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,4358,200713899_200720894_3,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona> Council> The city government> Council Executive |publisher=W3.bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref> The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,4358,200713899_200720876_3,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona> Council> The city government> Plenary |publisher=W3.bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>
The six ''Commissions del Consell Municipal'' (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction.

The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor.

The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|coming of the Spanish democracy]], Barcelona [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|had been governed]] by the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|PSC]], first with an [[absolute majority]] and later in coalition with [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]] and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens|ICV]]. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.

After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, [[Convergence and Union|CiU]] gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.

===Districts===
[[File:Districtes de Barcelona.svg|right|thumb|Districts of Barcelona]]
{{main|Districts of Barcelona}}
Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10&nbsp;administrative [[Districts of Barcelona|districts]] (''districtes'' in Catalan, ''distritos'' in Spanish), each one with its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.

The districts are based mostly on historical divisions. Several of the city's districts are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. The official names of these districts are in the Catalan language.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Spain}}
[[File:Paranimf de la Universitat de Barcelona.jpg|thumb|Main hall of the [[University of Barcelona]]]]
Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of [[public university|public universities]]. Most prominent among these is the [[University of Barcelona]] (established in 1450), a world-renowned research and teaching institution with campuses around the city. Barcelona is also home to the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]], and the newer [[Pompeu Fabra University]], and, in the private sector the [[EADA Business School]] founded in 1957, became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. [[IESE|IESE Business School]], as well as the largest private educational institution, the [[Ramon Llull University]], which encompasses internationally prestigious schools and institutes such as the [[ESADE]] Business School. The [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]], another public university, is located in [[Bellaterra]], a town in the [[Àmbit metropolità de Barcelona|Metropolitan Area]]. The [[Open University of Catalonia]], a private Internet-centered [[open university]], is also based in Barcelona.
[[File:Vestíbul Universitat de Barcelona.jpg|thumb|right|Historic building of the [[University of Barcelona]], entrance vestibule]]
The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as ''escoles concertades'', they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (''escoles privades'').

The language of instruction at public schools and ''escoles concertades'' is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or ''escola concertada'' in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or ''escola concertada'' offer International Baccalaureate programmes.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Barcelona}}
[[File:Palau de la Música - Interior general (2).JPG|thumb|[[Palau de la Música Catalana]]]]
Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. To a greater extent than the rest of Catalonia, where Catalonia's native [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is more dominant, Barcelona is a bilingual city: [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and Spanish are both [[official language]]s and widely spoken. The Catalan spoken in Barcelona, [[Central Catalan]], is the one closest to standard Catalan. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|arrival of democracy]], the Catalan culture (very much repressed during the [[Spanish State|dictatorship of Franco]]) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a [[global city|world-class city]] by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |title=Globalization and World Cities Study Group & Network – Inventory of World Cities |accessdate=7 July 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070630222000/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html| archivedate= 30 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

{{Main|Barcelona-El Prat Airport}}
Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about {{convert|17|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the [[Mediterranean]] coast, which handles above 35 million passengers per year and annual upward trend.<ref>[http://www.aena.es/csee/ccurl/74/661/anual-provisional-2012.pdf Informes Anuales - 2012] - AENA</ref> It is a main hub for [[Vueling Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]], and also a focus for [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] and [[Air Europa]]. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, but some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, commuter train ([[Aeroport railway station (el Prat)|Barcelona Airport railway station]]) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.

[[Sabadell Airport]] is a smaller airport in the nearby town of [[Sabadell]], devoted to [[Flight training|pilot training]], aerotaxi and private flights. Some low-cost airlines, such as [[Transavia.com]] and [[Ryanair]], prefer to use [[Girona-Costa Brava Airport]], situated about {{convert|90|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the north of Barcelona, the [[Reus Airport]], situated {{convert|77|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south, though they offer some flights from Barcelona-El Prat Airport and also [[Lleida-Alguaire Airport]] situated about {{convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the west of the city. The [[World's busiest city airport systems by passenger traffic|city airport system]], measured by passenger traffic, is one of busiest city airport systems in Europe, having nearly 40 million passengers per year.

===Seaport===
{{Main|Port of Barcelona}}
[[File:BarcelonaHarbour.jpg|thumb|[[Port of Barcelona]]]]
The [[Port of Barcelona]] has a 2000-year old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest [[containerization|container]] port, with a trade volume of 2.57 million TEU's in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/Statistics/WORLD%20PORT%20RANKINGS%2020081.pdf |title=AAPA World Port Rankings 2008 |format=PDF |accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref> The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its {{convert|7.86|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the Old Port), the commercial port and the logistics port ([[Barcelona Free Port]]). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the [[Llobregat]] river {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=off}} (1¼&nbsp;mi) to the south.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apb.es/wps/portal/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hgz2DDIFNLYwMLfzcDAyNjQy9vLwNTV38LM_1wkA6zeH_nIEcnJ0NHAwNfUxegCh8XA2-nUCMDdzOIvAEO4Gig7-eRn5uqX5CdneboqKgIAAeNRE8!/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfU0lTMVI1OTMwOE9GMDAyMzFKS0owNUVPODY!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/ExtranetAnglesLib/El%20Port%20de%20Barcelona/el+port/historia+del+port/cami+cap+el+futur/ |title=Port de Barcelona |language={{es icon}} |publisher=Apb.es |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>

The [[Port Vell]] area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the [[IMAX]] Port Vell and Europe's largest [[aquarium]] – [[Aquarium Barcelona]], containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 6 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, due to being situated in a designated tourist zone, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.

===Public transport===
{{Main|Autoritat del Transport Metropolità}}
{{double image|right|LlefiàL10.JPG|150|Barcelona Tram 01.jpg|150|Metro in Barcelona and Tram in Barcelona.}}
Barcelona is served by a comprehensive local public transport network that includes a [[rapid transit|metro]], a [[bus]] network, two separate modern tram networks, a separate historic tram line, and several funiculars and [[aerial tramway|aerial cable cars]]. The [[Barcelona Metro]] network comprises eleven lines, identified by an "L" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. Most of the network (nine lines) is operated by the [[Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona]] (TMB), but three lines are FGC commuter lines that run through the city. When finished, the L9 will be the second longest underground metro line in Europe with 42.6&nbsp;km; only shorter than London's {{convert|76|km|0|abbr=off}} Central Line.

The [[Estació del Nord Sports Hall|Estació del Nord]] (Northern Station), a former [[railway station]] which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.{{double image|left|Prius Taxi Barcelona.jpg|157|Estacio bicing bcn.jpg|143|Barcelona taxi and Barcelona [[Bicing|bicing station]].}}

Another company, [[TRAMMET]], operates the city's two modern tram networks, known as [[Trambaix]] and [[Trambesòs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V01/Serveis/Noticies/V01NoticiesLlistatNoticiesCtl/0,2138,1653_35144087_1_573780100,00.html?accio=detall&home=HomeBCN&nomtipusMCM=Noticia |title=News related with the council plans for the tram network union |publisher=W3.bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref> The historic tram line, the [[Tramvia Blau]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmb.net/en_US/barcelona/moute/planols/planotramviablau.jsp |title=Information of Tramvia Blau |publisher=Tmb.net |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref> connects the metro (L7, operated by FGC) to the [[Funicular del Tibidabo]] (operated by TMB). The Funicular de Tibidabo climbs the Tibidabo hill, as does the [[Funicular de Vallvidrera]] (FGC). The [[Funicular de Montjuïc]] (TMB) climbs the [[Montjuïc]] hill. The city has two [[aerial lift|aerial cable cars]]: the [[Montjuïc Cable Car]] (to the Montjuïc castle) and the [[Port Vell Aerial Tramway]] that runs via [[Torre Jaume I]] and [[Torre Sant Sebastia|Torre Sant Sebastià]] over the port.

Barcelona has a [[taxicab|metered taxi]] fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of [[Self-employment|self-employed]] drivers.<ref>[http://bcnweb2.bcn.es:8885/taxi/infocorp/informacio.html L'Administració i la gestió del Taxi de Barcelona]</ref> With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted.

===Railway===
Barcelona is a major hub for [[RENFE]], the Spanish state railway network, and its main [[Inter-city rail]] [[railway station|station]] is [[Barcelona Sants railway station|Barcelona-Sants]] station. The [[AVE]] [[high-speed rail]] system – designed for speeds of {{convert|310|km/h|0|abbr=on}} – was extended from [[Madrid]] to Barcelona ([[Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line]]) in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avui.cat/noticia/article/2-societat/5-societat/252283-barcelona-estrena-tgv.html |title=Barcelona estrena TGV|publisher=[[Avui]] |date=9 February 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |language=catalan}}</ref> Generally, Barcelona has high-speed rail links with major cities of Spain.

A high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France – [[LGV Perpignan–Figueres]] was launched in January 2013. [[Rodalies de Catalunya]] and the [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]] (FGC) run Barcelona's widespread [[commuter rail|commuter train]] service.

===Roads and highways===
[[File:BCN-rdaDalt-9976sh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[B-20 motorway (Spain)|B-20 motorway]] in Barcelona.]]
Barcelona lies on three international routes, including [[European route E15]] (north-south), [[European route E90]] (west-east) and [[European route E09]]; it also has a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including [[Autovía A-2|A-2]], [[Autovía A-7|A-7]]/[[Autopista AP-7|AP-7]], [[C-16 highway (Spain)|C-16]], [[C-17 highway (Spain)|C-17]], [[C-31 highway (Spain)|C-31]], [[C-32 highway (Spain)|C-32]], [[Autopista C-33|C-33]], [[Autovia C-60|C-60]]. The city is circled by three half [[Beltway|ring roads]] or bypasses, [[B20 motorway (Spain)|Ronda de Dalt (B-20)]] (on the mountain side), [[B10 motorway (Spain)|Ronda del Litoral (B-10)]] (along the coast) and [[Ronda del Mig]] (separated into two parts: [[Travessera de Dalt]] in the north and the [[Gran Via de Carles III]]), two partially covered<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/turisme/english/turisme/rutes/rondes_fr.htm |title=The covered Rondes (by-pass) |publisher=Bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref> fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.

The city's main arteries include [[Avinguda Diagonal, Barcelona|Diagonal Avenue]], which crosses it diagonally, [[Avinguda Meridiana, Barcelona|Meridiana Avenue]] which leads to [[Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, Barcelona|Glòries]] and connects with Diagonal Avenue and [[Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, Barcelona|Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes]], which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre.
