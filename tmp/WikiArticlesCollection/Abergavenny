'''Abergavenny''' ({{lang-cy|Y Fenni}}), meaning ''Mouth of the River Gavenny'', is a [[market town]] in [[Monmouthshire]], Wales.  It is located 15 miles (24&nbsp;km) west of [[Monmouth]] on the [[A40 road|A40]] and [[A465 road|A465]] roads, 6 miles (10&nbsp;km) from the English border. Originally the site of a [[Castra|Roman fort]], ''[[Gobannium]]'', it became a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Defensive wall|walled town]] within the [[Welsh Marches]]. The town contains the remains of a medieval stone [[castle]] built soon after the [[Norman invasion of Wales|Norman conquest of Wales]].  

Abergavenny is promoted as the "Gateway to Wales".<ref name="BBC">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/abergavenny/pages/article_pip.shtml | title=The Gateway to Wales | author=BBC | accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref><ref name="Frommers">{{cite web | url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/abergavenny/2501010001.html | title=Introduction to Abergavenny | author=Frommers | accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> Situated at the [[confluence]] of a [[tributary]] stream, the Gavenny, and the [[River Usk]],<<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |title=Abergavenny|edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=29}}</ref> it is almost surrounded by two mountains – the [[Blorenge]] (559&nbsp;m)<ref>Geograph British Isles – [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/498684 The Blorenge from the B4598 road at Ty'r-pwll]</ref> and the [[Sugar Loaf Mountain, Wales|Sugar Loaf]] (596&nbsp;m)<ref>Geograph British Isles – [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/493390 River Usk with Sugar Loaf in background]</ref> – and five hills: [[Ysgyryd Fawr]] (The Skirrid), Ysgyryd Fach (Skirrid Fach), Deri, Rholben and Mynydd Llanwenarth, known locally as "[[Llanwenarth]] Breast". It provides access to the nearby [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]] and the [[Brecon Beacons]] [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]]. The [[Offa's Dyke Path]] is close by and the [[Marches Way]], the [[Beacons Way]] and [[Usk Valley Walk]] all pass through the town.

== History ==

=== Origins of the town and its name ===
[[File:Abergaveny.jpg|thumb|left|Part of Abergavenny and Skirrid Fach (Little Skirrid) seen from the castle ruins]]
The [[Welsh placenames|name]] derives from a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] word ''Gobannia'' meaning "river of the blacksmiths", and relates to the town's pre-Roman importance in iron [[smelting|smelt]]ing. The name is related to the modern Welsh word ''gof'' ([[blacksmith]]), and so is also associated with the Welsh smith ''[[Gofannon]]'' from folklore. The river later became, in Welsh, ''Gafenni'', and the town's name became Abergavenny, meaning "mouth of (Welsh: ''Aber'') the Gavenny (''Gafenni'')".  In Welsh, the shortened form ''Y Fenni'' may have come into use for a very short period after about the 15th century, although pronounced similarly in English or Welsh the English spelling Abergavenny is in general use.<ref>Hywel Wyn Owen, ''The Place-Names of Wales'', 1998, ISBN 0-7083-1458-9</ref>

=== Roman period ===
Gobannium was a Roman fort guarding the road along the valley of the River Usk<ref name=EB/> which linked the legionary fortress of ''[[Burrium]]'' ([[Usk]]) and later ''[[Isca Augusta]]'' or Isca Silurum, ([[Caerleon]]) in the south with [[Y Gaer, Brecon]] and [[Mid Wales]]. It was also built to keep the peace among the local [[British Iron Age]] tribe, the [[Silures]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Remains of the walls of this fort were discovered west of the castle when excavating the foundations for a new [[post office]] and [[telephone exchange]] building in the late 1960s.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== 11th century ===
Abergavenny grew as a town in early [[Normans|Norman]] times under the protection of the [[Baron Bergavenny|Lords of Abergavenny]]. The first Baron was [[Hamelin de Balun]], from [[Ballon, Sarthe|Ballon]], a small town and castle in [[Maine-Anjou]] called "Gateway to Maine", near [[Le Mans]], today in the [[Sarthe]] ''[[département]]'' of France. He founded the [[Benedictine]] [[priory]], now the [[Priory Church of St Mary, Abergavenny|Priory Church of St Mary]], in the late 11th century. The Priory belonged originally to the [[Benedictine]] foundation of St. Vincent Abbaye at Le Mans. It was subsequently endowed by [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]], with a tenth or ''"[[tithe]]"'' of the profits of the castle and town. The church contains some unique [[alabaster]] [[Effigy|effigies]], [[church monument]]s and unique medieval wood carving, such as the [[Tree of Jesse]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== 12th and 13th centuries ===
Owing to its geographical location the town was frequently embroiled in the border warfare and power play of the 12th and 13th centuries in the Welsh Marches. In 1175, [[Abergavenny Castle]] was the site of the Massacre.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Reference to a market at Abergavenny is found in a charter granted to the Prior by William de Braose (d. 1211).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== 15th to 17th centuries ===
[[File:Abergavenny and Holy Mountain, Wales, 1890-1900.jpg|thumb|Abergavenny and [[Ysgyryd Fawr|Holy Mountain]] in the 1890s]]
[[Owain Glyndŵr]] attacked Abergavenny in 1404. According to popular legend, his raiders gained access to the walled town with the aid of a local woman who sympathised with the rebellion, letting a small party in via the Market Street gate at midnight. They were able to open the gate and allow a much larger party who set fire to the town and plundered its churches and homes leaving Abergavenny Castle intact. Market Street has been referred to as ''Traitors' Lane'' thereafter. In 1404 Abergavenny was declared its own nation by [[Ieuan ab Owain Glyndŵr]], illegitimate son of [[Owain Glyndŵr]]. The arrangement lasted approximately two weeks.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

At the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1541 the priory's endowment went towards the foundation of a free [[grammar school]], [[King Henry VIII Grammar School]], the site itself passing to the Gunter family.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], prior to the siege of [[Raglan Castle]] in 1645, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] visited Abergavenny and presided in person over the trial of [[Sir Trevor Williams, 1st Baronet|Sir Trefor Williams, 1st Baronet]] of [[Llangybi, Monmouthshire|Llangibby]], a [[Royalist]] who changed sides, and other [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1639 Abergavenny received a [[charter]] of incorporation under the title of [[bailiff]] and [[Burgess (word)|burgesses]]. A charter with extended privileges was drafted in 1657, but appears never to have been enrolled or to have come into effect. Owing to the refusal of the chief officers of the corporation to take the [[oath of allegiance]] to [[William III of England|William III]] in 1688, the charter was annulled, and the town subsequently declined in prosperity. Chapter 28 of the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|1535 Act of Henry VIII]], which provided that Monmouth, as [[county town]], should return one burgess to Parliament, further stated that other [[Monmouthshire (historic)|ancient Monmouthshire boroughs]] were to contribute towards the payment of the member. In consequence of this clause Abergavenny on various occasions shared in the election, the last instance being in 1685.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The right to hold two weekly markets and three yearly [[fair]]s, beginning in the 13th century, was held ever since as confirmed in 1657.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Abergavenny was celebrated for the production of Welsh [[flannel]], and also for the manufacture, whilst the fashion prevailed, of goats' hair [[periwig]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
[[Abergavenny railway station]] opened 2 January 1854 and is on the [[Welsh Marches Line]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} [[Adolf Hitler]]'s deputy [[Rudolf Hess]] was kept under escort at [[Maindiff Court Military Hospital]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], after his flight to Britain.<ref>BBC. WW2 People's War – [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/40/a5279240.shtml Marjorie's War]</ref>

== Baron of Abergavenny ==
The title of [[Baron Bergavenny|Baron Abergavenny]], in the Nevill family, dates from [[Edward Nevill, 3rd Baron Bergavenny]] (d. 1476), who was the youngest son of [[Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]] by his second wife [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Joan Beaufort]], daughter of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], first [[Duke of Lancaster]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} He married the heiress of [[Richard de Beauchamp, 1st Earl of Worcester]], whose father had inherited the castle and estate of Abergavenny, and was summoned in 1392 to parliament as Lord Bergavenny.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Edward Nevill was summoned to parliament with this title in 1450.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} His direct male descendants ended in 1387 in [[Henry Nevill, 6th Baron Bergavenny]], but a cousin, [[Edward Nevill, 8th Baron Bergavenny]] (d. 1622), was confirmed in the Barony in 1604.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} From him it has descended continuously, through fifteen individuals, the title being increased to an [[Earl]]dom in 1784; and in 1876 [[William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny|William Nevill]] {{sic}} 5th Earl (b. 1826), (d.1915) an indefatigable and powerful supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory Party]], was created 1st [[Marquess of Abergavenny]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Coldbrook Park was a country house in an estate some 2 km south east of the town. The house was originally built in the 14th century and belonged to the Herbert family for many generations until purchased by John Hanbury for his son, the diplomat Sir [[Charles Hanbury Williams]].<ref> {{cite book|title= An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire |volume =2|page=270}} </ref> Sir Charles reconstructed the house in 1746 with the addition of a 9 bay 2 storey Georgian facade with a Doric portico. It subsequently passed down in the Hanbury Williams family until it was demolished in 1954. <ref> {{cite web| url = http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/36701/details/COLDBROOK+HOUSE+%28DEMOLISHED%29/|title= COLDBROOK HOUSE (DEMOLISHED)|publisher= Royal Commission on the Ancient and Histoorical Sites of Wales|accessdate= 3 July 2013}} </ref>

==Welsh language==
In recent decades the number of Welsh speakers in the town has increased dramatically. The 2001 census recorded 10% of the local population spoke the language, a five fold increase over ten years from the figure of 2% recorded in 1991.<ref name="Welsh Language Board">{{cite web | url=http://www.byig-wlb.org.uk/english/news/pages/abergavennywelshspeakerseagertopromotelanguage.aspx|title=Abergavenny Welsh speakers eager to promote language}}</ref>

== Sporting traditions ==
Abergavenny is the home of [[Abergavenny Thursdays F.C.]], which was formed in 1927, and is currently a member of the Gwent County League Division 3. The club's current position comes within 15 years of their being one of the top sides in Welsh football, winning the old format [[Welsh Football League]] in 1991 and 1992, but being relegated in 1993 after just one season in the newly formed [[Welsh Premier League|League of Wales]]. The club suffered relegation from the Welsh Football League in 2001 and has since slipped down through the next two divisions into its current position, although the future is now looking brighter.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Abergavenny Cricket Club play at [[Pen-y-Pound, Abergavenny|Pen-y-Pound]], Avenue Road, and [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan CCC]] also play some of their games here.

== Markets and fairs ==

=== Cattle market ===
A [[cattle]] market has been held in Abergavenny on its current site since 1863.<ref name=EB/> During the period 1825–1863 a [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] market was held at a site in Castle Street, to stop the sale of sheep on the streets of the town. Today the market is leased and operated by Abergavenny Market Auctioneers Ltd, who hold regular livestock auctions on the site. Market days are: Tuesday – auction sale of finished sheep, cull ewe/store and fodder (hay and straw). Some Fridays - auction sale of cattle. A few other sales are held at the market on other days throughout the year.  Following the closure of [[Newport]]'s cattle market for redevelopment, Newport’s sales are held at Abergavenny every Wednesday.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 2011, doubts about the future of Abergavenny Cattle Market were raised following the granting of planning permission by [[Monmouthshire County Council]] for its demolition and replacement with a supermarket, car park, and library.<ref>[http://www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/download/meetings/id/4017/planning_committee_minutes_dated_14th_june_2011.pdf  Minutes of the Planning Committee held at County Hall, Cwmbran on 14 June 2011]</ref>

In January 2012, the Welsh Government announced the repeal the Abergavenny Improvement Acts of 1854 to 1871 which obliged the holding of a livestock market within the boundaries of Abergavenny town;<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-16525378 BBC News, ''Law change spells end for Abergavenny cattle market'', 12 January 2012]</ref> that repeal being effective from 26 March 2012.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2012/629/contents/made The Abergavenny Improvement Act 1854 (Repeal) Order 2012, 12 January 2012]</ref>

[[Monmouthshire County Council]], which requested that the Abergavenny Improvement Acts be repealed, is supporting plans for a new cattle market to be established about ten miles from Abergavenny  in countryside at Bryngwyn, some three miles from [[Raglan, Monmouthshire|Raglan]]. There has been extensive local opposition to this site, which is situated on a notoriously dangerous B road.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== The Market Hall ===
[[File:Abergavenny Butter Market - geograph.org.uk - 1313202.jpg|thumb|Abergavenny Market Hall in 2009]]
Various markets are held in the Market Hall, for example: Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays – retail market; Wednesdays – flea market; fourth Thursday of each month - [[farmers' market]]; third Sunday of each month – antique fair; second Saturday of each month – craft fair.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
