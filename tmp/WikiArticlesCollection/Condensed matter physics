{{Condensed matter physics}}
'''Condensed matter physics''' is a branch of [[physics]] that deals with the physical properties of condensed [[phase (matter)|phases]] of [[matter]].<ref name=pltaylor>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Philip L.|title=A Quantum Approach to Condensed Matter Physics|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-77103-X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hyx6BjEX4U8C&pg=PR9}}</ref> Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using [[physical laws]]. In particular, these include the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]] and [[statistical mechanics]].

The most familiar condensed phases are [[Solid-state physics|solids]] and [[liquid]]s, while more exotic condensed phases include the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by certain materials at low [[temperature]], the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spins]] on [[crystal lattice|atomic lattices]], and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] found in [[Ultracold atom|cold atomic systems]]. The study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using techniques of [[theoretical physics]] to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.

The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics: one third of all [[People of the United States|American]] physicists identify themselves as condensed matter physicists,<ref>{{cite web | url =  http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html | archiveurl =  http://web.archive.org/web/20090327141400/http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html | archivedate =  2009-03-27 |work=Physics Today Jobs|title = Condensed Matter Physics Jobs: Careers in Condensed Matter Physics| accessdate = 2010-11-01}}</ref> and The Division of Condensed Matter Physics (DCMP) is the largest division of the [[American Physical Society]].<ref name=aps-history>{{cite web|title=History of Condensed Matter Physics|url=http://www.aps.org/units/dcmp/history.cfm|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref>  The field overlaps with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], and [[nanotechnology]], and relates closely to [[atomic physics]] and [[biophysics]].

A variety of topics in physics such as [[crystallography]], [[metallurgy]], [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[magnetism]], etc., were treated as distinct areas, until the 1940s when they were grouped together as ''[[Solid state physics]]''. Around the 1960s, the study of physical properties of [[liquid]]s were added to this list, and it came to be known as condensed matter physics.<ref name=rmp />  According to physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson|Phil Anderson]], the term was coined by himself and [[Volker Heine]] when they changed the name of their group at the [[Cavendish Laboratories]], [[Cambridge]] from "Solid state theory" to "Theory of Condensed Matter",<ref name=pwa-princeton>{{cite web|title=Philip Anderson|url=http://www.princeton.edu/physics/people/display_person.xml?netid=pwa&display=faculty|work=Department of Physics|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> as they felt it did not exclude their interests in the study of liquids, [[nuclear matter]] and so on.<ref name=wsn>{{cite journal|title=More and Different|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/newsletter/newsletter/nov11n33p02.shtml|journal=World Scientific Newsletter|date=November 2011|volume=33 |page =2}}</ref> The [[Bell Labs]] (then known as the ''Bell Telephone Laboratories'') was one of the first institutes to conduct a research program in condensed matter physics.<ref name=rmp>{{cite journal|last=Kohn|first=W.|title=An essay on condensed matter physics in the twentieth century|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|year=1999|volume=71|issue=2|url=http://nanoelectronics.unibas.ch/education/ModernPhysics/KohnCondMat.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2012|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.71.S59|pages=S59|bibcode = 1999RvMPS..71...59K }}</ref>

References to "condensed" state can  be traced to earlier sources. For example, in the introduction to his 1947 "Kinetic theory of liquids" book,<ref name=exptcm>{{cite book|last=Frenkel|first=J.|title=Kinetic Theory of Liquids|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press
}}</ref> [[Yakov Frenkel]] proposed that "The kinetic theory of liquids must accordingly be developed as a generalization and extension of the kinetic theory of solid bodies. As a matter of fact, it would be more correct to unify them under the title of "condensed bodies".

Theoretical condensed matter physics involves the use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the [[Drude model]], the [[Band structure]] and the [[density functional theory]]. Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of [[phase transition]]s, such as the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], [[critical exponents]] and the use of mathematical techniques of [[quantum field theory]] and the [[renormalization group]].

Swiss physicist [[Felix Bloch]] provided a wave function solution to the [[Schrödinger equation]] with a [[Periodic function|periodic]] potential, called the [[Bloch wave]].<ref name=han-2010>{{cite book|last=Han|first=Jung Hoon|title=Solid State Physics|year=2010|publisher=Sung Kyun Kwan University|url=http://manybody.skku.edu/Lecture%20notes/Solid%20State%20Physics.pdf}}</ref>

Calculating electronic properties of metals by solving the many-body wavefunction is often computationally hard, and hence, approximation techniques are necessary to obtain meaningful predictions.<ref name=perdew-2010>{{cite journal|last=Perdew|first=John P.|coauthors=Ruzsinszky, Adrienn |title=Fourteen Easy Lessons in Density Functional Theory|journal=International Journal of Quantum Chemistry|year=2010|volume=110|pages=2801–2807|url=http://www.if.pwr.wroc.pl/~scharoch/Abinitio/14lessons.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2012|doi=10.1002/qua.22829|issue=15}}</ref> The [[Thomas–Fermi model|Thomas–Fermi theory]], developed in the 1920s, was used to estimate electronic energy levels by treating the local electron density as a [[Variational method|variational parameter]]. Later in the 1930s, [[Douglas Hartree]], [[Vladimir Fock]] and [[John C. Slater|John Slater]] developed the so-called [[Hartree–Fock method|Hartree–Fock wavefunction]] as an improvement over the Thomas–Fermi model. The Hartree–Fock method accounted for [[Exchange symmetry|exchange statistics]] of single particle electron wavefunctions, but not for their [[Coulomb interaction]]. Finally in 1964–65, [[Walter Kohn]], [[Pierre Hohenberg]] and [[Lu Jeu Sham]] proposed the [[density functional theory]] which gave realistic descriptions for bulk and surface properties of metals. The density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used since the 1970s for band structure calculations of variety of solids.<ref name=perdew-2010 />

===Symmetry breaking===
[[File:Melting icecubes.gif|thumb|upright|[[Ice]] melting into water. Liquid water has continuous [[translational symmetry]], which is broken in crystalline ice.]]
{{main|Symmetry breaking}}
Certain states of matter exhibit symmetry breaking, where the relevant laws of physics possess some [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] that is broken. A common example is crystalline solids, which break continuous [[translational symmetry]]. Other examples include magnetized [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], which break rotational symmetry, and more exotic states such as the ground state of a [[BCS theory|BCS]] [[superconductor]], that breaks [[U(1)]] rotational symmetry.<ref name=cnayak>{{cite book|last=Nayak|first=Chetan|title=Solid State Physics|publisher=UCLA|url=http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~nayak/solid_state.pdf}}</ref>

[[Goldstone's theorem]] in [[quantum field theory]] states that in a system with broken continuous symmetry, there may exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy, called the Goldstone [[boson]]s. For example, in crystalline solids, these correspond to [[phonon]]s, which are quantized versions of lattice vibrations.<ref name=goldstone>{{cite journal|last=Leutwyler|first=H.|title=Phonons as Goldstone bosons|journal=ArXiv|year=1996|arxiv=hep-ph/9609466v1.pdf|bibcode = 1996hep.ph....9466L|pages=9466 }}</ref>

===Phase transition===
{{main|Phase transition}}
The study of [[critical phenomena]] and [[phase transition]]s is an important part of modern condensed matter physics.<ref>{{cite book |title=Physics Through the 1990s|publisher=National Research Council|year=1986|chapter=Chapter 3: Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bVq5_t9YwhYC&pg=PA7|isbn=0-309-03577-5}}</ref> Phase transition refers to the change of phase of a system, which is brought about by change in an external parameter such as [[temperature]]. In particular, [[quantum phase transition]]s refer to transitions where the temperature is set to zero, and the phases of the system refer to distinct [[ground state]]s of the [[Hamiltonian matrix|Hamiltonian]]. Systems undergoing phase transition display critical behavior, wherein several of their properties such as [[correlation length]], [[specific heat]] and [[Magnetic susceptibility|susceptibility]] diverge. Continuous phase transitions are described by the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], which works in the so-called [[mean field approximation]]. However, several important phase transitions, such as the [[Mott insulator]]–[[superfluid]] transition, are known that do not follow the Ginzburg–Landau paradigm.<ref name=balents-2005>{{cite journal|last=Balents|first=Leon|coauthors=Bartosch, Lorenz; Burkov, Anton; Sachdev, Subir and Sengupta, Krishnendu |title=Competing Orders and Non-Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson Criticality in (Bose) Mott Transitions|journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics|year=2005|volume=Supplement|issue=160|doi=10.1143/PTPS.160.314|arxiv = cond-mat/0504692 |bibcode = 2005PThPS.160..314B|pages=314 }}</ref> The study of phase transitions in strongly correlated systems is an active area of research.<ref name=Sachdev-LG-2010>{{cite journal|last=Sachdev|first=Subir|coauthors=Yin, Xi|title=Quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau–Ginzburg paradigm and supersymmetry|journal=Annals of Physics|year=2010|volume=325|issue=1|arxiv=0808.0191v2.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.aop.2009.08.003|pages=2|bibcode = 2010AnPhy.325....2S }}</ref>

==Experimental==
Experimental condensed matter physics involves the use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials. Experimental probes include effects of electric and [[magnetic fields]], measurement of [[response function]]s, [[transport theory (statistical physics)|transport properties]] and [[thermometry]].<ref name=exptcm>{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Robert C.|title=Experimental Techniques in Condensed Matter Physics at Low Temperatures|year=1988|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-15002-6}}</ref> Commonly used experimental techniques include [[spectroscopy]], with probes such as [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-rays]], [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared light]] and [[inelastic neutron scattering]]; study of thermal response, such as [[specific heat]] and measurement of transport via thermal and heat [[conduction (heat)|conduction]].

===Scattering===
{{main|Scattering}}
Several condensed matter experiments involve scattering of an experimental probe, such as [[X-ray]], optical [[photon]]s, [[neutron]]s, etc., on constituents of a material. The choice of scattering probe depends on the observation energy scale of interest.<ref name=chaikin-lubensky>{{cite book|last=Chaikin|first=P. M.|last2=Lubensky|first2=T.

X-rays have energies of the order of 10 [[electron volt|keV]] and hence are able to probe atomic length scales, and are used to measure variations in electron charge density. [[Neutron]]s can also probe atomic length scales and are used to study scattering off nuclei and electron [[spin (quantum mechanics)|spins]] and magnetization (as neutrons themselves have spin but no charge).<ref name=chaikin-lubensky/> Coulomb and [[Mott scattering]] measurements can be made by using electron beams as scattering probes,<ref>{{cite book|last=Riseborough|first=Peter S.|title=Condensed Matter Physics I|year=2002|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/74216869/179/Electron-Scattering-Experiments}}</ref> and similarly, [[positron]] annihilation can be used as an indirect measurement of local electron density.<ref name=siegel-1980>{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=R.
