{{Politics of Chile}}
Chile's government is a [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Chile]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a formal [[multi-party system]] that in practice behaves like a two-party one, due to [[Binomial System|binomialism]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of the [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature of Chile. [[Constitution|The Constitution]] of Chile was approved in a national plebiscite in September 1980, under the [[military Junta|military]] [[government]] of dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]]. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet left power in the 1988, saying this country was ready to keep going along with a [[plebiscite]], the Constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President [[Ricardo Lagos]] signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and [[senators for life]], granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years while also disabling immediate re-election.

The bicameral [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] ''(Congreso Nacional)'' consists of the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] ''(Senado)'' and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] ''(Cámara de Diputados).''

Chile's congressional elections are governed by a unique [[binomial system]] that rewards coalition slates. Each coalition can present two candidates for the two Senate and two lower-chamber seats apportioned to each chamber's electoral districts. Typically, the two largest coalitions split the seats in a district. Only if the leading coalition ticket outpolls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats. The political parties with the largest representation in the current Chilean Congress are the centrist [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrat Party]] and the conservative [[Independent Democratic Union]] ''(Unión Demócrata Independiente)''. The [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] and the small [[Humanist Party of Chile|Humanist Party]] failed to gain any seats in the 1998 elections.

Elections are very labor intensive but efficient, and vote counting normally takes place the evening of the election day. One voting table, with a ballot-box each, is set up for at-most 200 names in the voting registry. Each table is manned by five people (''vocales de mesa'') from the same registry. Vocales have the duty to work as such during a cycle of elections, and can be penalized legally if they do not show up. A registered citizen can only vote after his identity has been verified at the table corresponding to his registry. Ballots are manually counted by the five vocales, after the table has closed, at least eight hours after opening, and the counting witnessed by representatives of all the parties who choose to have observers. 

The Senate is made up of 38 members elected from regions or subregions. Senators serve approximately eight-year terms.

The Chamber of Deputies has 120 members, who are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The last congressional elections were held on December 11, 2006. The next congressional elections are scheduled for December 2009.

The current Senate composition is as follows: 20 seats are held by the [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy]] (CPD): Six [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] (PDC), eight [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialists]] (PS), three [[Party for Democracy]] (PPD) and three [[Social Democrat Radical Party]] (PRSD); 17 by the [[Alliance for Chile]] (APC): nine [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI) and eight [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] (RN); and one independent leaning right.

The current lower house&mdash;the Chamber of Deputies &mdash;contains 65 members of the governing coalition: 21 [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] (PDC), 15 [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialists]] (PS), 22 [[Party for Democracy]] (PPD) and seven [[Social Democrat Radical Party]] (PRSD); 54 from the center-right [[Alliance for Chile]](APC): 34 [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI) and 20 [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] (RN); and 1 from the [[Independent Regional Force]] (FRI) coalition: 1 [[Regionalist Action Party of Chile]] (PAR).

Since 1987, the Congress operates in the port city of [[Valparaíso]], about 110 kilometers (~70&nbsp;mi.) northwest of the capital, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. However some commissions are allowed to meet in other places, especially Santiago. Congressional members have tried repeatedly to relocate the Congress back to Santiago, where it operated until the [[Chilean Coup of 1973]], but have not been successful. The last attempt was in 2000, when the project was rejected by the Constitutional Court, because it allocated funds from the national budget, which, under the Chilean Constitution, is a privilege of the President.

==Legal system==
{{main|Law of Chile}}
[[File:Tribjusticiacl.jpg|thumb|[[Supreme Court of Chile]]]]
Chile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile|Supreme Court]]. The judges on the Supreme Court or Corte Suprema are appointed by the president and ratified by the Senate from lists of candidates provided by the court itself. The president of the Supreme Court is elected by the 21-member court.

Chile's legal system is [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based. It is primarily based on the [[Civil code]] of 1855, derived from Spanish law and subsequent codes influenced by European law of the last half of the 19th Century. It does not accept compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.

From the year 2000 onward, Chile completely overhauled its criminal justice system; a new, US-style [[adversarial system]] has been gradually implemented throughout the country with the final stage of implementation in the Santiago metropolitan region completed on June 9, 2001
