The '''Common Desktop Environment''' ('''CDE''') is a [[desktop environment]] for [[Unix]] and [[OpenVMS]], based on the [[Motif (software)|Motif widget toolkit]]. It was part of the [[UNIX98|UNIX98 Workstation]] standard,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/testing/prodstds.htm|title=Testing requirements by Product Standard|publisher=The Open Group|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=29 September 2013}}</ref> and was long the "classic" Unix desktop associated with commercial Unix workstations. After a long history as [[proprietary software]], it was released as [[free software]] on 6 August 2012, under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], version 2 or later.<ref name=osnews2012-08-06>

== History ==

[[SunSoft, Inc.|SunSoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]] and [[Unix System Laboratories|USL]] announced CDE in June 1993 as a joint development within the [[Common Open Software Environment]] (COSE) initiative. The primary environment was based on HP's [[Visual User Environment|VUE]] (Visual User Environment), itself derived from the [[Motif Window Manager]] (mwm). IBM contributed its [[Common User Access]] model from [[OS/2]]'s [[Workplace Shell]]. [[Novell]] provided desktop manager components and scalable systems technologies from [[UNIX System V]]. Sun contributed its [[ToolTalk]] application interaction framework and a port of its [[DeskSet]] productivity tools, including mail and calendar clients, from its [[OpenWindows]] environment.<ref>{{cite press release

In March 1994 CDE became the responsibility of the "new OSF", a merger of the [[Open Software Foundation]] and [[Unix International]];<ref>

Until about 2000, users of Unix desktops regarded CDE as the ''[[de facto]]'' standard, but at that time, other desktop environments such as [[GNOME]] and [[K Desktop Environment 2]] were quickly becoming mature, and became almost universal on the [[Linux]] platform, which already had a larger user base than most commercial Unixes in total.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} [[Red Hat]] is the only Linux distribution to which CDE has been ported, although it has since been phased out in favor of GNOME.

In 2001, Sun Microsystems announced that they would phase out CDE as the standard [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] desktop environment in favor of GNOME. Solaris 10, released in early 2005, includes both CDE and the GNOME-based [[Java Desktop System]]. The Solaris 11 release in November 2011 only contains GNOME as a full desktop, though some CDE libraries, such as Motif and Tooltalk, remain for binary compatibility. The [[OpenSolaris]] open source project did not include CDE, and had no intent to make Solaris CDE available as open source.<ref>{{cite web

[[Hewlett-Packard|HP's]] [[OpenVMS]] uses CDE as its standard desktop environment.

== Licensing ==
{{Portal|Free software}}
The Open Group released Motif in 2000 as Open Motif under a "revenue sharing" license that does not meet either the [[Open Source Definition|open source]] or [[Free software licence|free software]] definitions. (The Open Group had wished to make it open source, but did not quite succeed in achieving this.<ref>

In 2006, a petition was created asking The Open Group to release the source code for CDE and Motif under a free license.<ref>{{cite web

OpenCDE, an open source project to replicate CDE, was started in early 2010. The project intended to reproduce the [[look and feel]], organization, and feature set of CDE without using any CDE-derived code.<ref>
