== Biography == 
[[Image:BF Skinner Grave.JPG|thumb|right|The Skinners' grave at Mount Auburn Cemetery]]
Skinner was born in [[Susquehanna, Pennsylvania]] to William and Grace Skinner. His father was a lawyer. He became an [[atheism|atheist]] after a Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the [[Hell]] that his grandmother described.<ref>"Within a year I had gone to Miss Graves to tell her that I no longer believed in God. 'I know,' she said, 'I have been through that myself.' But her strategy misfired: I never went through it." B.F. Skinner, pp. 387-413, E.G. Boring and G. Lindzey's A History of Psychology in Autobiography (Vol. 5), New York: Appleton Century-Crofts, 1967.</ref> His brother Edward, two and a half years younger, died at age sixteen of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. He attended [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in New York with the intention of becoming a writer. He found himself at a disadvantage at Hamilton College with many due to his intellectual attitude.<ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013">"B.F. Skinner: A Life [Paperback]." B.F. Skinner: A Life: Daniel W. Bjork, Bjork: 9781557984166: Amazon.com: Books. N.p., n.d. Web. 04 June 2013.</ref> While attending, he joined [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] Fraternity.  He wrote for the school paper, but as an atheist, he was critical of the religious school he attended. He also attended Harvard University after receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in English literature in 1926 where he would later research, teach, and eventually become a prestigious board member. While at Harvard, he invented his prototype for the [[Skinner Box]]. Also, a fellow student Fred Keller, convinced Skinner he could make an [[experimental science]] from the study of behavior. This led Skinner to join Keller and they created different tools for small experiments.<ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013"/> After graduation, he unsuccessfully tried to write a great novel while he lived with his parents, which he later called the Dark Years.<ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013"/> He soon became disillusioned with his literary skills despite encouragement from widely renowned literary genius Robert Frost and concluded that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with [[John B. Watson]]'s ''Behaviorism'' led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own operant behaviorism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=B. F. Skinner: a Life}}</ref>

Skinner received a [[PhD]] from Harvard in 1931, and remained there as a researcher until 1936. He then taught at the [[University of Minnesota]] at Minneapolis and later at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]], where he was chair of the psychology department from 1946–1947, before returning to Harvard as a tenured professor in 1948. He remained at Harvard for the rest of his life. In 1973 Skinner was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=October 9, 2012}}</ref>

In 1936, Skinner married Yvonne Blue. The couple had two daughters, [[Julie Vargas|Julie]] (m. Vargas) and Deborah (m. Buzan). He died of [[leukemia]] on August 18, 1990,<ref>http://www.humanistsofutah.org/humanists/bfskinner.html</ref> and is buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].<ref>Bjork, D.W. (1993). B.F. Skinner, A Life. New York: Basic Books.</ref>  Skinner continued to write and work until just before his death. A few days before Skinner died, he was given a lifetime achievement award by the American Psychological Association and delivered a 15 minute address concerning his work.<ref>{{cite web|title="Skinner, Burrhus Frederic (1904 - 1990)."|url=http://www.credoreference.com/topic/skinner_burrhus_1904_1990|work=Credo Reference, Topic Pages|publisher=Credo Reference, Gale|accessdate=1October 2013}}</ref>

A controversial figure, Skinner has been depicted in many different ways. Much of Skinner’s criticism derived from his penchant for attempting to apply science proven in lab environments at a universal level. 

== Theory ==

Skinner called his particular brand of behaviorism "Radical" behaviorism.<ref>''About Behaviorism'' Ch. 1 ''Causes of Behaviour'' § 3 ''Radical Behaviorism'' B. F. Skinner 1974 ISBN 0-394-71618-3</ref> Radical behaviorism is the philosophy of the science of behavior. It seeks to understand behavior as a function of environmental histories of reinforcing consequences. Such a functional analysis makes it capable of producing technologies of behavior (see [[Applied behavior analysis]]). This applied behaviorism lies on the opposite side of the ideological spectrum as the field of cognitive science. Unlike less austere behaviorism, it does not accept private events such as thinking, perceptions, and unobservable emotions in a causal account of an organism's behavior:
<blockquote>
 The position can be stated as follows: what is felt or introspectively observed is not some nonphysical world of [[consciousness]], mind, or mental life but the observer's own body. This does not mean, as I shall show later, that introspection is a kind of psychological research, nor does it mean (and this is the heart of the argument) that what are felt or introspectively observed are the causes of the behavior. An organism behaves as it does because of its current structure, but most of this is out of reach of introspection. At the moment we must content ourselves, as the methodological behaviorist insists, with a person's genetic and environment histories. What are introspectively observed are certain collateral products of those histories.
<br/>...<br/>
In this way we repair the major damage wrought by [[mentalism (disambiguation)|mentalism]]. When what a person does [is] attributed to what is going on inside him, investigation is brought to an end. Why explain the explanation? For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis of the role of the environment. Ignorance of that role led in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.<ref>''ibid''. pp. 18−20 of the paperback edition which had the redacted typo s/it/is/.</ref></blockquote>

Skinner stood at the opposite position from humanistic psychology for his whole career, and denied humans possessing freedom and dignity as well as evidenced in his novel Beyond Freedom and Dignity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B.F|title="Some Responses to the Stimulus "pavlov" (remarks at the Dinner of the Pavlovian Society, Saturday, February 12, 1966)."|journal=Integrative Physiological and Behavioral Science : the Official Journal of the Pavlovian Society|date=1996|year=1966|accessdate=2 October 2013}}</ref> Most of his theories were supposed to be based on self-observation, which caused him to become a supporter for behaviorism. Much of this self-observed theory stemmed from Thorndike’s Puzzle Box, a direct antecedent to Skinner’s Box. The psychologist further expanded on Thorndike’s earlier work by introducing the concept of Reinforcement to Thorndike’s Law of Effect.<ref name="ReferenceA">See [[B.F. Skinner: a Life]] for research citations.</ref> Skinner was an advocate of behavioral engineering and he thought that people should be controlled through the systematic allocation of external rewards.<ref>Thomas Grenning "B. F. Skinner: 1904-1990" ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology'' vol.31 no.2 Spring,1991 112-113</ref> Skinner believed that behavior is maintained from one condition to another through similar or same consequences across these situations. In short, behaviors are causal factors that are influenced by the consequences.  His contribution to the understanding of behavior influenced many other scientists to explain social behavior and contingencies.<ref>Carlson, Neil and et al. 2010.  "Psychology the Science of Behaviour", p. 447.  Pearson Canada, United States of America.  ISBN 978-0-205-64524-4.</ref>

Reinforcement is a central concept in [[Behaviorism]], and was seen as a central mechanism in the shaping and control of behavior. A common misconception is that negative reinforcement is synonymous with punishment.  This misconception is rather pervasive, and is commonly found in even scholarly accounts of Skinner and his contributions.  To be clear, while positive reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the application of some event (e.g., praise after some behavior is performed), negative reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the removal or avoidance of some aversive event (e.g., opening and raising an umbrella over your head on a rainy day is reinforced by the cessation of rain falling on you).

Both types of reinforcement strengthen behavior, or increase the probability of a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied (positive reinforcement) or something removed or avoided (negative reinforcement). Punishment and extinction have the effect of weakening behavior, or  decreasing the future probability of a behavior's occurrence, by the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation), removal of a desirable stimulus (negative punishment or punishment by contingent withdrawal), or the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which causes the behavior to stop (extinction).

Skinner also sought to understand the application of his theory in the broadest behavioral context as it applies to living organisms, namely natural selection.<ref name=Skinner1981>{{Cite journal |date=31 July 1981 |author=Skinner, B.F |title=Selection by Consequences |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=213 |issue=4507 |pages=501–504 |doi=10.1126/science.7244649 |url=http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2010 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

== Schedules of reinforcement ==
{{Main|Reinforcement}}
Part of Skinner's analysis of behavior involved not only the power of a single instance of reinforcement, but the effects of particular schedules of reinforcement over time.

The most notable [[schedules of reinforcement]] presented by Skinner were interval (fixed or variable) and ratio (fixed or variable).

* '''Continuous reinforcement''' — constant delivery of reinforcement for an action; every time a specific action was performed the subject instantly and always received a reinforcement. This method is impractical to use, and the reinforced behavior is prone to extinction.

* '''Interval Schedules''' : based on the time intervals between reinforcements   <ref name="Psychology 2nd Edition">Psychology 2nd Edition</ref>
**'''Fixed Interval Schedule (FI)''' : An operant conditioning principle in which reinforcements are presented at fixed time periods, provided that the appropriate response is made.
**'''Variable Interval Schedule (VI)''' : An operant conditioning principle in which behaviour is reinforced based on an average time that has expired since the last reinforcement.
Both FI and VI tend to produce slow, methodical responding because the reinforcements follow a time scale that is independent of how many responses occur.

*'''Ratio Schedules''' : based on the ratio of responses to reinforcements     <ref name="Psychology 2nd Edition"/>
**'''Fixed Ratio Schedule (FR)''' : An operant conditioning principle in which reinforcement is delivered after a specific number of responses have been made.
**'''Variable Ratio Schedule (VR)''' : An operant conditioning principle in which the delivery of reinforcement is based on a particular average number of responses (ex. slot machines).
VR produce slightly higher rates of responding than FR because organism doesn’t know when next reinforcement is. The higher the ratio, the higher the response rate tends to be.<ref>Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. Wegner.(2011).Schedules of Reinforcement. Psychology second edition.</ref>

== Inventions ==

=== Air crib ===
In an effort to help his wife cope with the day-to-day tasks of child rearing due to the birth of their second child, Skinner thought he might be able to improve upon the standard [[Infant bed|crib]]. He invented the 'air-crib' to meet this challenge. An 'air-crib'<ref>[http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/06/what-man-can-make-of-man/308973/ Air-crib photograph] in "What Man Can Make of Man", by James Bennet. ''[[The Atlantic]],'' June 2012.</ref> (also known as a 'baby tender' or humorously as an 'heir conditioner') is an easily cleaned, temperature and humidity-controlled crib Skinner designed to assist in the raising of babies.

Skinner designed this initial, preliminary prototype of the Air-Crib for his first child because he thought it would help parents who were awakened by their crying babies at night due to cold temperatures, and a need for essential clothing, or sheets. Despite allegations to the contrary, Skinner’s daughter Deborah claims to never have felt abused or neglected by use of the Air-Crib.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  He thought doing so would alleviate “troublesome” environmental issues.<ref name="Holland">Holland, J. (1992). B.F Skinner. Pittsburgh: American Psychologist.
</ref>

It was one of his most controversial inventions, and was popularly mischaracterized as cruel and experimental.<ref name="s nopes">Snopes.com [http://www.snopes.com/science/skinner.asp "One Man and a Baby Box"], accessed on 12-29-07.</ref>  The crib was often compared to his [[operant conditioning chamber]], crudely known as the "Skinner Box." This association with a system of experimentation and pellet rewards quashed any success. It was designed to make early childcare simpler (by greatly reducing laundry, diaper rash, cradle cap, etc.), while encouraging the baby to be more confident, mobile, comfortable, healthy and therefore less prone to cry. (Babies sleep and will sometimes play in air cribs but it is misleading to say they are 'raised' in them. Apart from newborns, most of a baby's waking hours will be spent out of the crib.) Reportedly it had some success in these goals.<ref name="s nopes" />  Air-cribs were later unsuccessfully commercially manufactured by several companies. After companies had attempted to sell this product to a large market, they had failed in their marketing strategies.<ref name="s nopes"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Burrhus Fredrick Skinner|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/worldsocs/skinner_burrhus_frederic_1904_1990|work=Skinner, Burrhus Frederic (1904 - 1990)|publisher=Gale, Credo Reference|accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref>

A 2004 book by [[Lauren Slater]], entitled ''[[Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychology Experiments of the Twentieth Century]]'' <ref name="OB">Slater, L. (2004) [[Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychology Experiments of the Twentieth Century|Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century]], London, Bloomsbury</ref> caused much controversy by mentioning the common rumors that Skinner had used his baby daughter Deborah in some of his experiments and that she had subsequently committed suicide. Although Slater's book immediately afterwards stated that the rumours were false, Slater also allowed the reader to believe that Deborah had disappeared, thus doing little to quash the rumors (apart from her own denial of their truth). A reviewer in ''[[The Observer]]'' in March 2004 then misquoted Slater's books as supporting the rumours. This review was read by Deborah Skinner (now Deborah Buzan, an artist and writer living in London) who then in turn wrote a vehement riposte in ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Buzan|first=Deborah Skinner|title=I was not a lab rat|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/mar/12/highereducation.uk|accessdate=29 May 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 March 2004}}</ref>

=== Operant conditioning chamber ===
{{Main|Operant conditioning chamber}}
While a researcher at Harvard,<ref name="Thorne, B. M. 2001">Thorne, B. M., & Henley, T. B. (2001). ''Connections in the history and systems of psychology''. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> B. F. Skinner invented the [[operant conditioning]] chamber, popularly referred to as the Skinner box,<ref name="Popplestone, J. A. 1994">Popplestone, J. A., & McPherson, M. W. (1994). ''An illustrated history of American psychology'' (2nd ed.). Akron, OH: The University of Akron Press.</ref> to measure responses of organisms (most often, rats and pigeons) and their orderly interactions with the environment. The box had a lever and a food tray, and a hungry rat could get food delivered to the tray pressing the lever. Skinner observed that when a rat was put in the box, it would wander around, sniffing and exploring, and would usually press the bar by accident, at which point a food pellet would drop into the tray. After that happened, the rate of bar pressing would increase dramatically and remain high until the rat was no longer hungry.

Skinner discovered that consequences for the organism played a large role in how the organism responded in certain situations.<ref>Benjamin, L. T. (2007). ''A brief history of modern psychology''. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.</ref> For instance, when the rat would pull the lever it would receive food. Subsequently, the rat made frequent pulls on the lever.<ref>Thorne, B. M., & Henley, T. B. (2001).''Connections in the history and systems of psychology''. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> Negative reinforcement was also exemplified by Skinner placing rats into an electrified chamber that delivered unpleasant shocks. Levers to cut the power were placed inside these boxes. By running a current through the “[[operant conditioning chamber]],” Skinner noticed that the rats, after accidentally pressing the lever in a frantic bid to escape, quickly learned the effects of implementing the lever and consequently used this knowledge to stop the currents both during and prior to electrical shock. These two learned responses are known as [[Escape Learning]] and [[Avoidance Learning]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
The operant chamber for pigeons involves a plastic disc in which the pigeon pecks in order to open a drawer filled with grains.<ref>Edward K, Fancher,R.(1995). B. F. Skinner: A Life-Two Views. Contemporary Psychology: A journal of Reviews. 40(8): 727−727.</ref> The Skinner box led to the principle of reinforcement, which is the probability of something occurring based on the consequences of a behavior.<ref name= D.Schacter, D. Gilbert, D. Wegner, ""Pscyhology"" (2009) :pp.17Second Edition. LooseLeaf >Thorne, B. M., & Henley, T. B. (2001)</ref>

This device was an example of his lifelong ability to invent useful devices, which included whimsical devices in his childhood<ref name="PML">B. F. Skinner, (1984) ''Particulars of My Life''. Devices included a potato shooting machine and a perpetual motion machine, as well as a device to separate ripe from unripe berries.</ref> to the ''cumulative recorder'' to measure the [[rate of response]] of organisms in an operant chamber. Even in old age, Skinner invented a ''Thinking Aid'' to assist in writing.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1901/jaba.1987.20-379 | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B.

=== Cumulative recorder ===
The cumulative recorder is an instrument used to automatically record behavior graphically. Its graphing mechanism consisted of a rotating drum of paper equipped with a marking needle. The needle would start at the bottom of the page and the drum would turn the roll of paper horizontally. This cumulative recorder was used for the Skinner box to record the rat's behavior.<ref name="Thorne, B. M. 2001"/> This apparatus produced consistent and accurate records of behavior.<ref name="Thorne, B. M. 2001"/>

=== Teaching machine ===
[[Image:Skinner teaching machine 01.jpg|thumb|right|The teaching machine, a mechanical invention to automate the task of [[programmed instruction]]]]

The teaching machine was a mechanical device whose purpose was to administer a curriculum of [[programmed instruction]].  In one incarnation, it housed a list of questions, and a mechanism through which the learner could respond to each question.  Upon delivering a correct answer, the learner would be rewarded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/smcneil/cuin6373/idhistory/1950.html|title=Programmed Instruction and Task Analysis|publisher=College of Education, University of Houston}}</ref>

Skinner advocated the use of teaching machines for a broad range of students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). Another of the multiple machines he envisioned could teach rhythm:

:A relatively simple device supplies the necessary contingencies. The student taps a rhythmic pattern in unison with the device. "Unison" is specified very loosely at first (the student can be a little early or late at each tap) but the specifications are slowly sharpened. The process is repeated for various speeds and patterns. In another arrangement, the student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded by the machine, though not in unison, and again the specifications for an accurate reproduction are progressively sharpened. Rhythmic patterns can also be brought under the control of a printed score. (Skinner, 1961, p. 381).

The teaching machine had such instructional potential because it provided immediate and regular reinforcement that maintained students’ interest, as the “material in the machine [was] always novel” (Skinner, 1961, p.&nbsp;387). In this way, a student’s attention could be maintained without the use of aversive controls. The efficiency of the teaching machine resulted from its automatic provision of reinforcement, individualized pace setting, and a coherent instructional sequence for the student. It engaged students and allowed them to learn by doing.

Teaching machines, though perhaps rudimentary, were not rigid instruments of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved based upon reports of students’ performance. For example, if a student’s report showed numerous incorrect responses, then the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions- the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently when their error rate is minimized. Along these lines, multiple choice formats were not best suited for teaching machines because contingencies of reinforcement would be left to chance; moreover, this format could increase student mistakes and induce erroneous behaviors.

Not only useful in teaching explicit skills, machines could also promote the development of a repertoire of behaviors Skinner called self-management. Self-management refers to how students think- how they attend to the environment with the view of responding appropriately to stimuli. Machines give students the opportunity to first pay attention before receiving a reward as reinforcement. This is in stark contrast with what Skinner noticed as the classroom practice of initially capturing students’ attention (e.g., with a lively video) and delivering a reward (e.g., entertainment) before they have actually done attended- a practice which actually counters the development of self-management and fails to correctly apply reinforcements for correct behavior.
What Skinner referred to as a teaching machine would probably be akin to a computer software program today that provided highly structured and incremental instruction. Skinner’s influence on such machines is undeniable. He was the first to pioneer the use of machines in the classroom, especially at the primary level. Today teaching machines such as Language Labs have been incorporated into modern education. Though it was just one of a number of inventions, it embodies much of Skinner’s theory of learning and has wide-reaching implications for education in general and classroom instruction in particular.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|title=Why we need teaching machines|journal=Harvard Educational Review|year=1961|volume=31|pages=377–398}}</ref>

There has been a resurgence of interest in the notion of the teaching machine and its relationship to adaptive learning systems of the early 21st Century <ref>[http://philmcrae.com/2/post/2013/04/rebirth-of-the-teaching-maching-through-the-seduction-of-data-analytics-this-time-its-personal1.html Philip McRae, Ph.D.]</ref>

== Influence on education ==
{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}
<!--Good idea to have this section, but it needs to be written in an encyclopedic style, with references-->
<!--A possible source might be The Technology of Teaching, as well as Keller's PSM and so on and so on-->
Skinner influenced [[education]] as well as psychology in both his ideology and literature. In Skinner’s view, education has two major purposes: (1) to teach repertoires of both verbal and nonverbal behavior; and (2) to encourage students to display an interest in instruction.  He endeavored to bring students’ behavior under the control of the environment by reinforcing it only when particular stimuli were present.  Because he believed that human behavior could be affected by small consequences, something as simple as “the opportunity to move forward after completing one stage of an activity” could prove reinforcing (Skinner, 1961, p.&nbsp;380). Skinner favored active learning in the sense that students were not merely passive recipients of information doled out by teachers. He was convinced that a student had to take action; “to acquire behavior, the student must engage in behavior” (Skinner, 1961, p.&nbsp;389).

Moreover, Skinner was quoted as saying "[[Teacher]]s must learn how to teach&nbsp;... they need only to be taught more effective ways of teaching." Skinner asserted that positive reinforcement is more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment, with obvious implications for the then widespread practice of [[rote learning]] and [[school discipline|punitive discipline]] in education. Skinner also suggests that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment.

In ''The Technology of Teaching'', Skinner has a chapter on why teachers fail (pages 93–113): Essentially he says that teachers have not been given an in-depth understanding of [[teaching]] and [[learning]].  Without knowing the science underpinning teaching, teachers fall back on procedures that work poorly or not at all, such as:
:* using aversive techniques (which produce escape and avoidance and undesirable emotional effects);
:* relying on telling and explaining ("Unfortunately, a student does not learn simply when he is shown or told." p.&nbsp;103);
:* failing to adapt learning tasks to the student's current level;
:* failing to provide positive reinforcement frequently enough.

Skinner suggests that any age-appropriate skill can be taught.  The steps are
#Clearly specify the action or performance the student is to learn to do.
#Break down the task into small achievable steps, going from simple to complex.
#Let the student perform each step, reinforcing correct actions.
#Adjust so that the student is always successful until finally the goal is reached.
#Transfer to intermittent reinforcement to maintain the student's performance.
Skinner's views on education are extensively presented in his book ''The Technology of Teaching''. It is also reflected in [[Fred S. Keller]]'s ''Personalized System of Instruction'' and [[Ogden Lindsley|Ogden R. Lindsley's]] ''[[Precision teaching|Precision Teaching]]''.
The limitations of Skinner's views can be seen from his argument that it is: 'a step forward' to 'abolish' the 'autonomous inner man.' ([[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]] (1971) p.&nbsp;215)

Skinner associated punishment with avoidance. For example, he thought a child may be forced to practice playing his instrument as a form of seemingly productive discipline. This child would then associate practicing with punishment and thus learn to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. Additionally, teachers who use educational activities to punish children could cause inclinations towards rebellious behavior such as vandalism and opposition to education.<ref name="Holland" />

== ''Walden Two'' and ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' ==
Skinner is popularly known mainly for his books ''[[Walden Two]]'' and ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'' for which he made the cover of ''[[TIME]]'' Magazine.<ref>"B.F. Skinner Sep. 20, 1971." Http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19710920,00.html. Web.</ref> The former describes a visit to a fictional "experimental community"<ref>B. F. Skinner, (1968). "The Design of Experimental Communities", ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (Volume 16). New York: Macmillan, 1968, pages 271-275.</ref> in 1940s United States, where the productivity and happiness of the citizens is far in advance of that in the outside world because of their practice of scientific social planning and use of operant conditioning in the raising of children.

''Walden Two'', like [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau's]] ''[[Walden]]'', champions a lifestyle that does not support war or foster competition and social strife. It encourages a lifestyle of minimal consumption, rich social relationships, personal happiness, satisfying work and leisure.<ref>Ramsey, Richard David, ''Morning Star: The Values-Communication of Skinner's '''Walden Two''''', Ph.D. dissertation, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, December 1979, available from University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, MI.  Attempts to analyze ''Walden Two'', ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', and other Skinner works in the context of Skinner's life; lists over 500 sources.</ref> In 1967, [[Kat Kinkade]] founded the intentional community [[Twin Oaks Community|Twin Oaks]], using Walden Two as a blueprint. The community is still in existence today and continues to use the Planner-Manager system and other aspects of the original book in its self-governance.

In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', Skinner suggests that a technology of behavior could help to make a better society. We would, however, have to accept that an [[autonomous agent]] is not the driving force of our actions. Skinner offers alternatives to punishment and challenges his readers to use science and modern technology to construct a better society.

== Political views ==
Skinner's political writings emphasized his hopes that an effective and humane science of behavioral control – a technology of human behavior – could help problems unsolved by earlier approaches or aggravated by advances in technology such as the [[atomic bomb]]. One of Skinner's stated goals was to prevent humanity from destroying itself.<ref>see Beyond Freedom and Dignity, 1974 for example</ref>  He comprehended political control as aversive or non-aversive, with the purpose to control a population. Skinner supported the use of [[positive reinforcement]] as a means of coercion, citing Jean-Jacques Rousseau's novel ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'' as an example of freedom literature that "did not fear the power of positive reinforcement".<ref name="W2"/>
Skinner's book, ''Walden Two'', presents a vision of a decentralized, localized society, which applies a practical, scientific approach and futuristically advanced behavioral expertise to peacefully deal with social problems. Skinner's [[utopia]] is both a thought experiment and a [[rhetoric]]al piece. In his book, Skinner answers the problem that exists in many utopian novels – "What is the Good Life?"  In ''Walden Two'', the answer is a life of friendship, health, art, a healthy balance between work and leisure, a minimum of unpleasantness, and a feeling that one has made worthwhile contributions to one's society. This was to be achieved through behavioral technology, which could offer alternatives to coercion,<ref name="W2"/> as good science applied correctly would help society,<ref name="BFD"/> and allow all people to cooperate with each other peacefully.<ref name="W2"/> Skinner described his novel as "my New Atlantis", in reference to [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon]]'s [[New Atlantis|utopia]].<ref>A matter of Consequences, p.&nbsp;412.</ref> He opposed corporal punishment in the school, and wrote a letter to the California Senate that helped lead it to a ban on spanking.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nanette |last=Asimov |title=Spanking Debate Hits Assembly |work=SFGate|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=1996-01-30 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/01/30/MN71634.DTL&hw=spanking+debate&sn=009&sc=334 |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref>

Buckley Jr, ''On the Firing Line'', p.&nbsp;87.}}

== Superstitious pigeons ==
One of Skinner's experiments examined the formation of [[superstition]] in one of his favorite experimental animals, the [[pigeon]]. Skinner placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon "at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird's behavior."  He discovered that the pigeons associated the delivery of the food with whatever chance actions they had been performing as it was delivered, and that they subsequently continued to perform these same actions.<ref>[http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/financial-markets/content/sessions/session-8-human-foibles-fraud-manipulation-and ECON 252, Lecture 8] by Professor Robert Schiller at Yale University</ref>

{{quote|One bird was conditioned to turn counter-clockwise about the cage, making two or three turns between reinforcements. Another repeatedly thrust its head into one of the upper corners of the cage. A third developed a 'tossing' response, as if placing its head beneath an invisible bar and lifting it repeatedly. Two birds developed a pendulum motion of the head and body, in which the head was extended forward and swung from right to left with a sharp movement followed by a somewhat slower return.<ref name=superstition>Skinner, B. F. "'Superstition' in the Pigeon," ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' #38, 1947.</ref><ref>[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/ Classics in the History of Psychology — Skinner (1948)]</ref>}}

Skinner suggested that the pigeons behaved as if they were influencing the automatic mechanism with their "rituals" and that this experiment shed light on human behavior:

{{quote|The experiment might be said to demonstrate a sort of superstition. The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one's fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one's luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothing—or, more strictly speaking, did something else.<ref name=superstition />}}

Modern behavioral psychologists have disputed Skinner's "superstition" explanation for the behaviors he recorded. Subsequent research (e.g. Staddon and Simmelhag, 1971), while finding similar behavior, failed to find support for Skinner's "adventitious reinforcement" explanation for it. By looking at the timing of different behaviors within the interval, Staddon and Simmelhag were able to distinguish two classes of behavior: the ''terminal response'', which occurred in anticipation of food, and ''interim responses'', that occurred earlier in the interfood interval and were rarely contiguous with food.  Terminal responses seem to reflect classical (as opposed to operant) conditioning, rather than adventitious reinforcement, guided by a process like that observed in 1968 by Brown and Jenkins in their "autoshaping" procedures.  The causation of interim activities (such as the schedule-induced [[polydipsia]] seen in a similar situation with rats) also cannot be traced to adventitious reinforcement and its details are still obscure (Staddon, 1977).<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=1348192 Timberlake & Lucas, (1985) "JEAB"]</ref>

This experiment was also repeated on humans, in a less controlled manner, on the popular British TV series ''[[Trick or Treat (TV series)|Trick or Treat]]'', leading to similar conclusions to Skinner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/derren-brown-trick-or-treat/4od#3193912 |title=Derren Brown: Trick or Treat - 4oD |publisher=Channel 4 |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>

"As the senses grow dull, the stimulating environment becomes less clear. When reinforcing consequences no longer follow, we are bored, discouraged and depressed."<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

== Criticism ==

=== J.E.R. Staddon ===
As understood by Skinner, ascribing ''dignity'' to individuals involves giving them credit for their actions. To say "Skinner is brilliant" means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's [[determinism|determinist]] theory is right, he is merely the focus of his environment. He is not an originating force and he had no choice in saying the things he said or doing the things he did. Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. [[J. E. R. Staddon]] (''The New Behaviorism'', 2001) has argued the [[Compatibilism|compatibilist position]], that Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.<ref>Staddon, J. (1995) On responsibility and punishment.  ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Feb., 88−94. Staddon, J.  (1999) On responsibility in science and law. ''Social Philosophy and Policy'', 16, 146-174.

=== Noam Chomsky ===
Perhaps Skinner's best known critic, [[Noam Chomsky]] published a [[Verbal Behavior#Chomsky's review|review]] of Skinner's ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]'' two years after it was published.<ref name = "Chomsky review">{{Cite journal|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|year=1959|title=Reviews: ''Verbal behavior'' by B.

Skinner, who rarely responded directly to critics, never formally replied to Chomsky's critique. Many years later, [[Kenneth MacCorquodale]]'s reply<ref name="KMC">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1333660/ On Chomsky's Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior]</ref> was endorsed by Skinner.

Chomsky also reviewed Skinner's ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', using the same basic motives as his ''Verbal Behavior'' review. Among Chomsky's criticisms were that Skinner's laboratory work could not be extended to humans, that when it was extended to humans it represented '[[Scientism|scientistic]]' behavior attempting to emulate science but which was not scientific, that Skinner was not a scientist because he rejected the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] of theory testing, and that Skinner had no science of behavior.<ref>A. N. Chomsky, (1972) "The Case Against B. F. Skinner."</ref>

=== Psychodynamic psychology ===
Skinner has been repeatedly criticized for his supposed animosity towards [[Freud]], [[psychoanalysis]], and [[psychodynamic psychology]]. There is clear evidence, however, that Skinner shared several of Freud's assumptions, and that he was influenced by Freudian points of view in more than one field, among them the analysis of [[defense mechanisms]], such as [[Psychological repression|repression]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Toates |first=F. |year=2009 |title=Burrhus F. Skinner: The shaping of behavior |location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, England |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan }}</ref> To study such phenomena, Skinner even designed his own [[projective test]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rutherford |first=A. |year=2003 |title=B.

=== TV Guide ===
In the controversial books ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' (1971) and ''Walden II'' (1946/1968), Skinner laid out his vision of auto-pian society in which behavior was controlled by the judicious application of the principle of reinforcement.<ref>beyond freedom and dignity. New York: Bantam Books.</ref> In those books, he put forth the simple but stunning claim that our subjective sense of free will is an illusion  and that when we think that we are exercising free will, we are actually responding to present and past patterns of reinforcement. We do things in the present that have been rewarding in the past, and our sense of "choosing" to do them is nothing more than an illusion. Skinner argued that his insights could be used to increase human well-being and solve social problems. Not surprisingly, that claim sparked an outcry from critics who believed that Skinner was giving away one of our most cherished attributes − free will − and calling for a repressive society that manipulated people for its own ends. The criticism extended to ''TV Guide'', which featured an interview with Skinner and called his ideas "the teaming of mankind through a system of dog obedience  schools for all".
