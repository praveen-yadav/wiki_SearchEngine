[[Image:Costa Rica demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Costa Rica, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]

According to the [[United Nations]], in 2009 Costa Rica has an estimated population of 4,579,000 people. Together, whites and mestizos make up a 94% of the population, 3% are [[black people]], 1% [[Amerindians]], 1% Chinese, and 1% other.

Just under 3% of the population is of black African descent who are called [[Afro-Costa Rican]]s or [[West Indian]]s and are English-speaking descendants of 19th century black [[Jamaica]]n immigrant workers. Another 1% is composed of ethnic Chinese, and less than 1% are Middle Easterners, mainly of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] descent but also Palestinians.

There is also a community of North American retirees from the United States and Canada, followed by fairly large numbers of [[European Union]] expatriates (esp. Scandinavians and from Germany) come to retire as well, and Australians. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The indigenous population today numbers about 60,000 (1% of the population) with some [[Miskito]] and [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] (mixed African and West Indian with indigenous [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]]/[[Carib people|Carib]]/[[Taíno people|Taíno]]) peoples live in the coastal regions.

Descendants of 19th century West Indian and [[Jamaican diaspora|Jamaican]] immigrant workers constitute an English-speaking minority and at 3% of the population—number about 96,000 to 100,000. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

An estimated 10% of the Costa Rican population is made up of [[Nicaragua]]ns.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm www.state.gov]  Background Note: Costa Rica - People</ref> There is also a number of [[Colombia]]n refugees. Moreover, Costa Rica took in lots of refugees from a range of other Latin American countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 80s - notably from [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].

Almost 100,000 Costa Ricans (2% of the country's population) live abroad, mostly in the United States, Mexico and Spain.

==Population and ancestry==
{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}
In 2009, Costa Rica has a populations of 4,579,000 and it's increasing at a rate of 1.5% per year, still relatively high. If this rate continues, the population will increase to 9,158,000 in about 46 years.<ref>http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2006/WPP2006_Highlights_rev.pdf</ref> The population density is nearly 90 people per square km, the third highest in Central America.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density</ref>

Today most Costa Ricans are of primarily Spanish ancestry with minorities of German, Italian, French, Dutch, British, Swedish and Greek ancestry. 
40% being White, 40% Castizo, and 14% being Mestizo. European and western-oriented, plus American pop culture has a large impact in Costa Rica, also thrived in a fairly democratic prosperous economy.

European immigration used Costa Rica to get across the isthmus of Central America as well to emigrate on the USA West Coast ([[California]]) in the late 19th century and to the 1910s before the [[Panama Canal]] opened. Other Europeans ethnic groups known to lives in Costa Rica are Russians, Danes, Belgians, Portuguese, Croats, Hungarians, Turks, Armenians and Georgians. Without a doubt Costa Rica is the Central American country with the largest white population.

Costa Rica has three small minority groups: [[Black people|blacks]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] and Asians (mostly Chinese). Blacks represent about 3% of the population. Indians and Asians represent 1.5% each.

Blacks live along the Caribbean coast. Their ancestors came to Costa Rica from [[Jamaica]] in the late 19th century to build railroads and to work on the banana plantations. The Indians live primarily in isolated communities in the highlands and along both coasts. Most of them still keep their traditional ways of life.

Nearly all Costa Ricans speak Spanish; but many blacks speak a traditional Jamaican dialect of English, also most of the Indians speak their [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|own language]]. According to the [[World Factbook]] the main religions are: Roman Catholic, 76.3%; Evangelical, 13.7%; Jehovah's Witnesses, 1.3%; other Protestant, 0.7%; other, 4.8%; none, 3.2%.

Approximately 40% live in rural areas and 60% in urban areas. The rate of urbanization estimated for the period 2005&ndash;2010 is 2.3% per annum,<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2212.html?countryName=Costa%20Rica&countryCode=cs&regionCode=ca&#cs</ref> one of the highest among [[developing country|developing countries]].
