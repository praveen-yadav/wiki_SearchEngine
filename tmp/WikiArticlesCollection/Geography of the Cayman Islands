==Geology==
The islands are located on the Cayman Rise which forms the northern margin of the [[Cayman Trough]]. The trough is the deepest point in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and forms part of the tectonic boundary between the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Caribbean Plate]]. The Cayman Rise extends from southeastern [[Cuba]] along the northern margin of the Cayman Trough toward [[Costa Rica]] and resulted from [[Paleocene]] to [[Eocene]] [[island arc]] formation with associated [[volcanism]] along an extinct [[subduction zone]].<ref>[http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/165_SR/chap_20/chap_20.htm H.

A. Brunt. Springer. p. 1. ISBN 9780792324621.</ref>

== Climate ==
The Cayman Islands have a [[tropical marine climate]], with a [[wet season]] of warm, rainy summers (May to October) and a [[dry season]] during the winter (November to April). Terrain is mostly a low-lying [[limestone]] base surrounded by [[coral reef]]s.

A major [[natural hazard]] is the [[tropical cyclone]]s that form during the [[Atlantic hurricane season]] from July to November.

== Environmental issues ==
An important environmental issue is the lack of [[fresh water]] resources. [[Drinking water]] supplies must be met by [[rainwater]] catchment and [[desalination]]. Destruction of natural resources by the tourism industry and construction of new homes for investors is becoming a great concern to local citizens.

== Natural resources ==
[[File:Map of Grand Kayman.gif|Map of Grand Cayman|thumb|400px]]
[[File:North Side Sunset.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sunset from North Side beach, Grand Cayman]]
[[Natural resource]]s include [[fish]] and a climate and beaches that foster [[tourism]], which is the islands' major industry. A 2005 estimate of land use determined that the Cayman Islands' had 3.85 percent [[arable land]] and no permanent crops.

== Districts ==
The territory is subdivided into sixth districts that are governed by district managers and that have a role as electoral districts and as regional units for statistics. Five of the districts are located on the main island, Grand Cayman. The sixth, Sister Islands, comprises the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac.

The population is concentrated in the three (south-)western districts George Town (capital), West Bay, and Bodden Town. Those have a population density many times higher than all remaining districts.
