The '''Dalai Lama''' is a high [[lama]] in the [[Gelug]] or "yellow Hat" school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], founded by [[Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419). The name is a combination of the Mongolian word ''dalai'' meaning "ocean" and the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] word {{Bo-textonly|བླ་མ་}} (''bla-ma) ''meaning "guru, teacher, mentor".<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lama Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-10.</ref><!-- According to the current Dalai Lama{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}, the Tibetan word "lama" corresponds precisely to the better known [[Sanskrit]] word "[[guru]]". -->

According to Tibetan Buddhist doctrine, the Dalai Lama is the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] in a line of [[tulku]]s who are considered to be manifestations of the [[bodhisattva]] of compassion, [[Avalokiteśvara]]. The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the leader of the [[Gelug]] School, but this position belongs officially to the [[Ganden Tripa]], which is a temporary position appointed by the Dalai Lama who, in practice, exerts much influence. The line of Dalai Lamas began as a lineage of spiritual teachers; the [[5th Dalai Lama]] assumed political authority over Tibet.

For certain periods between the 17th century and 1959, the Dalai Lamas sometimes directed the [[Tibetan government]], which administered portions of Tibet from [[Lhasa]]. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] remained the head of state for the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] ("Tibetan government in exile") until his retirement on March 14, 2011. He has indicated that the institution of the Dalai Lama may be abolished in the future, and also that the next Dalai Lama may be found outside Tibet and may be female.<ref>[http://www.newser.com/story/13544/next-dalai-lama-may-be-female.html Next Dalai Lama May Be Female]</ref> The Chinese government rejected this and asserted that only it has the authority to select the next Dalai Lama.<ref>[http://www.tricycle.com/blog/chinese-government-we-will-choose-next-dalai-lama Chinese Government: We Will Choose Next Dalai Lama] from [[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]</ref>

==The original use of the title ''Dalai Lama''==
In 1578 the [[Mongol]] ruler [[Altan Khan]] bestowed the title ''Dalai Lama'' on [[Sonam Gyatso]]. The title was later applied retroactively to the two predecessors in his reincarnation line: [[Gendun Drup]], founding abbot of [[Tashilhunpo Monastery|Trashilhünpo]] and close disciple of [[Je Tsongkhapa]]; and [[Gendun Gyatso]], abbot of Trashilhünpo, [[Drepung Monastery|Drepung]], and [[Sera Monastery|Sera]].<ref>Stein, R.A.. "The Evolution of Monastic Power." In ''The Tibetan History Reader'', edited by Gray Tuttle and Kurtis R. Schaeffer. New York: Columbia University Press, 2013.</ref> The current 14th Dalai Lama and others seeking to assert the historical independence of Tibet believe that Altan Khan did not bestow a title as such, only intending to translate the name "Sonam Gyatso" into Mongolian.<ref>Laird (2006), p. 143.</ref> Others have noted the title's similarity to ''Čingis Qāghan,'' or "oceanic sovereign" (usually anglicized as "[[Ghengis Khan]]"), a name taken by the Mongol leader Temüjin in 1206 to commemorate his rule of a newly united Mongolian Empire.<ref>Roux, Jean-Paul. (2003). ''Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire'', p. 25. Trans from the French by Toula Balas. Thames & Hudson. London. ISBN 0-500-30113-1.</ref> Tibetans themselves address the Dalai Lama as ''Gyalwa Rinpoche'' ("Precious Victor"), ''Kundun'' ("Presence"), ''Yishin Norbu'' ("[[Cintamani (jewel)|Wish fulfilling Gem]]") and so on.<ref>Sheel (1989), p. 23.</ref>

The current Dalai Lama is often called "[[His Holiness]]" (HH) by Westerners in imitation of the traditional address for the [[Pope]]. It should be noted that there is no correspondence to this form of address in Tibetan. Before the 20th century, European sources often referred to the Dalai Lama as the "Grand Lama". For example, in 1785 [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]] mocked [[George Washington]] by terming him the "Grand Lama of this Country."<ref>''Pennsylvania Aurora''. August 1795.</ref>

{{multiple image |width=200 |direction=vertical |align=left

}}

During 1252, [[Kublai Khan]] granted an audience to [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]] and [[Karma Pakshi]], the 2nd [[Karmapa]]. Karma Pakshi, however, sought the patronage of [[Möngke Khan]].
Before his death in 1283, Karma Pakshi wrote a will to protect the established interests of his sect by advising his disciples to locate a boy to inherit the black hat. His instruction was based on the premise that Buddhist ideology is eternal, and that [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] would send emanations to complete the missions he had initiated. Karma Pakshi's disciples acted in accordance with the will and located the reincarnated boy of their master. The event was the beginning of the teacher reincarnation system for the Black-Hat Line of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. During the [[Ming Dynasty]], the Yongle Emperor bestowed the title ''Great Treasure Prince of Dharma'', the first of the three ''Princes of Dharma'', upon the Black-Hat [[Karmapa]]. Various sects of Tibetan Buddhism responded to the teacher reincarnation system by creating similar lineages.

===Unification of Tibet===
In the 1630s, Tibet became entangled in power struggles between the rising [[Manchu people|Manchu]] and various Mongol and [[Oirats|Oirat]] factions. [[Ligden Khan]] of the [[Chahar Mongols|Chakhar]], retreating from the Manchu, set out to Tibet to destroy the [[Gelug|Yellow Hat sect]]. He died on the way to [[Qinghai]] (Koko Nur) in 1634.<ref>Michael Weiers, ''Geschichte der Mongolen'', Stuttgart 2004, p. 182f</ref> His vassal [[Tsogt Taij]] continued the fight, even having his own son Arslan killed after Arslan changed sides. Tsogt Taij was defeated and killed by [[Güshi Khan]] of the [[Khoshud]] in 1637, who would in turn become the overlord of Tibet, and act as a "Protector of the Yellow Church."<ref>Rene Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes'', New Brunswick 1970, p. 522</ref> Güshi helped the [[Lozang Gyatso, 5th Dalai Lama|Fifth Dalai Lama]] to establish himself as the highest spiritual and political authority in Tibet and destroyed any potential rivals. The time of the Fifth Dalai Lama was, however, also a period of rich cultural development.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Fifth Dalai Lama's death was kept secret for fifteen years by the regent ({{bo|t=སྡེ་སྲིད།|w=sde-srid|lang=yes}}), [[Sanggye Gyatso]]. This was apparently done so that the [[Potala Palace]] could be finished, and to prevent Tibet's neighbors taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.<ref>Laird (2006), pp. 181–182</ref>

Tsangyang Gyatso, the [[Tsangyang Gyatso, 6th Dalai Lama|Sixth Dalai Lama]], was not enthroned until 1697. Tsangyang Gyatso enjoyed a lifestyle that included drinking, the company of women, and writing love songs.<ref>Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, ''Kleine Geschichte Tibets'', München 2006, pp. 109–122.</ref> In 1705, [[Lha-bzang Khan|Lobzang Khan]] of the Khoshud used the sixth Dalai Lama's escapades as excuse to take control of Tibet. The regent was murdered, and the Dalai Lama sent to Beijing. He died on the way, near [[Koko Nur]], ostensibly from illness. Lobzang Khan appointed a new Dalai Lama who, however was not accepted by the Gelugpa school. [[Kelzang Gyatso, 7th Dalai Lama|Kelzang Gyatso]] was discovered near Koko Nur and became a rival candidate.

The [[Dzungars]] invaded Tibet in 1717, and deposed and killed Lobzang Khan's pretender to the position of Dalai Lama. This was widely approved. However, they soon began to loot the holy places of Lhasa, which brought a swift response from the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in 1718; but his military expedition was annihilated by the Dzungars in the [[Battle of the Salween River]], not far from Lhasa.<ref>Richardson (1984), pp. 48–9.</ref><ref name="Stein 1972, p. 85">Stein (1972), p. 85.</ref>

A second, larger, expedition sent by the Kangxi Emperor expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720 and the troops were hailed as liberators. They brought Kelzang Gyatso with them from [[Kumbum]] to Lhasa and he was installed as the seventh Dalai Lama in 1721.<ref>Schirokauer, 242</ref>

::After him [Jamphel Gyatso the eighth Dalai Lama (1758–1804)], the 9th and 10th Dalai Lamas died before attaining their majority: one of them is credibly stated to have been murdered and strong suspicion attaches to the other. The 11th and 12th were each enthroned but died soon after being invested with power. For 113 years, therefore, supreme authority in Tibet was in the hands of a Lama Regent, except for about two years when a lay noble held office and for short periods of nominal rule by the 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas.

::It has sometimes been suggested that this state of affairs was brought about by the Ambans—the Imperial Residents in Tibet—because it would be easier to control the Tibet through a Regent than when a Dalai Lama, with his absolute power, was at the head of the government. That is not true. The regular ebb and flow of events followed its set course. The Imperial Residents in Tibet, after the first flush of zeal in 1750, grew less and less interested and efficient. Tibet was, to them, exile from the urbanity and culture of Peking; and so far from dominating the Regents, the Ambans allowed themselves to be dominated. It was the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans that led to five successive Dalai Lamas being subjected to continuous tutelage.<ref>Richardson (1984), pp. 59–60.</ref>

Thubten Jigme Norbu, the elder brother of the present 14th Dalai Lama, describes these unfortunate events as follows:

::It is perhaps more than a coincidence that between the seventh and the thirteenth holders of that office, only one reached his majority. The eighth, Gyampal Gyatso, died when he was in his thirties, Lungtog Gyatso when he was eleven, Tsultrim Gyatso at eighteen, Khadrup Gyatso when he was eighteen also, and Krinla Gyatso at about the same age. The circumstances are such that it is very likely that some, if not all, were poisoned, either by loyal Tibetans for being Chinese-appointed impostors, or by the Chinese for not being properly manageable.<ref>Norbu and Turnbull (1968), p. 311.</ref>

[[File:Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return. Summer residence Nechung. 1993.JPG|upright|thumb|Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return. Summer residence of 13th Dalai Lama, [[Nechung]], Tibet.]]

[[Thubten Gyatso]], the 13th Dalai Lama, assumed ruling power from the monasteries, which previously had great influence on the Regent, during 1895. Due to his two periods of exile in 1904–1909, to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910–1912 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations. After his return from exile in India and [[Sikkim]] during January 1913, he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the [[Maharaja]] and the British Political officer in Sikkim and the king of [[Nepal]] rather than letting the [[Kashag]] or parliament do it.<ref>Sheel (1989), pp. 24, 29.</ref>

Thubten Gyatso issued a Declaration of Independence for his kingdom in [[Central Tibet]] from China during the summer of 1912 and standardised a Tibetan flag, though no other sovereign state recognized the independence.<ref>Sheel (1989), p. 20.</ref> He expelled the [[Amban]]s and all Chinese civilians in the country, and instituted many measures to modernise Tibet. These included provisions to curb excessive demands on peasants for provisions by the monasteries and tax evasion by the nobles, setting up an independent police force, the abolition of the death penalty, extension of secular education, and the provision of electricity throughout the city of Lhasa in the 1920s.<ref>Norbu and Turnbull (1968), pp. 317–318.</ref> Thubten Gyatso died in 1933.

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] was not formally enthroned until 17 November 1950, during the People's Republic of China [[Invasion of Tibet (1950–1951)|invasion]] of the kingdom. In 1951, he and the Tibetan government formally accepted the [[Seventeen Point Agreement]] by which Tibet was formally incorporated into the People's Republic of China. Fearing for his life in the wake of a revolt in Tibet in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India where he has led a [[government in exile]] since.<ref>[http://tibet.net/en/index.php?id=9 ''Tibet in Exile''], CTA Official website, retrieved 2010-12-15.</ref><ref>[http://www.metrolic.com/dalai-lama-intends-to-retire-as-head-of-tibetan-state-in-exile-148540/ ''Dalai Lama Intends To Retire As Head of Tibetan State In Exile''] by Mihai-Silviu Chirila (2010-11-23), Metrolic, retrieved 2010-12-15.</ref> With the aim of launching guerrilla operations against the Chinese, the [[CIA]] funded the Dalai Lama $1.7 million a year in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/02/world/world-news-briefs-dalai-lama-group-says-it-got-money-from-cia.html|title=Dalai Lama Group Says It Got Money From C.I.A.|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1998-10-02}}</ref> In 2001, he ceded his absolute power over the government to an elected parliament of selected Tibetan exiles.

==Residence==
Starting with the [[5th Dalai Lama]] and until the 14th Dalai Lama's flight into exile during 1959, the Dalai Lamas spent winters at the [[Potala Palace]] and summers at the [[Norbulingka]] palace and park. Both are in [[Lhasa]] and approximately 3&nbsp;km apart.

Following the failed [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge in [[India]]. The then Indian Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], allowed in the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government officials. The Dalai Lama has since lived in exile in [[Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]], in the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] in [[northern India]], where the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] is also established. Tibetan refugees have constructed and opened many schools and Buddhist temples in Dharamshala.<ref>[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/04/express/dispatches-from-the-tibetan-front-dharamsala-india "Dispatches from the Tibetan Front: Dharamshala, India,"] Litia Perta, ''The Brooklyn Rail'', April 4, 2008</ref>

==Searching for the reincarnation==
[[File:DLHaus.jpg|thumb|The search for the 14th Dalai Lama took the High Lamas to [[Taktser]] in [[Amdo]]]]
[[File:PaldenLhamo.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Palden Lhamo]], the female guardian spirit of the sacred lake, [[Lhamo La-tso]], who promised [[Gendun Drup]] the 1st Dalai Lama in one of his visions that "she would protect the reincarnation lineage of the Dalai Lamas"]]

By the Himalayan tradition, ''[[phowa]]'' is the discipline that transfers the mindstream to the intended body. Upon the death of the Dalai Lama and consultation with the [[Nechung Oracle]], a search for the Lama's ''yangsi'', or [[reincarnation]], is conducted. Traditionally, it has been the responsibility of the High Lamas of the [[Gelug|Gelugpa tradition]] and the Tibetan government to find his reincarnation. The process can take around two or three years to identify the Dalai Lama, and for the 14th, [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], it was four years before he was found. Historically, the search for the Dalai Lama has usually been limited to Tibet, though the third tulku{{who|date=May 2013}} was born in [[Mongolia]]. Tenzin Gyatso, however, has stated that he will not be reborn in the People's Republic of China, though he has also suggested he may not be reborn at all, suggesting the function of the Dalai Lama may be outdated.<ref name = "sdpcnw">{{cite web|title=The Dalai Lama|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/people/dalailama_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-05-17|date=Last updated 2006-09-21
}}</ref>

The High Lamas used several ways in which they can increase the chances of finding the reincarnation. High Lamas often visit [[Lhamo La-tso]], a lake in central Tibet, and watch for a sign from the lake itself. This may be either a vision or some indication of the direction in which to search, and this was how Tenzin Gyatso was found.
It is said that [[Palden Lhamo]], the female guardian spirit of the sacred lake Lhamo La-tso promised [[Gendun Drup]], the 1st Dalai Lama, in one of his visions "that she would protect the reincarnation lineage of the Dalai Lamas."{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Ever since the time of [[Gendun Gyatso]], the 2nd Dalai Lama, who formalised the system, the Regents and other monks have gone to the lake to seek guidance on choosing the next reincarnation through visions while meditating there.<ref>Laird (2006), pp. 139, 264–265.</ref>

The particular form of Palden Lhamo at Lhamo La-tso is Gyelmo Maksorma, "The Victorious One who Turns Back Enemies". The lake is sometimes referred to as "Pelden Lhamo Kalideva", which indicates that Palden Lhamo is an emanation of the goddess [[Kali]], the [[shakti]] of the [[Hindu]] God [[Shiva]].<ref>Dowman (1988), p. 260.</ref>

{{quote|Lhamo Latso ... [is] a brilliant azure jewel set in a ring of grey mountains. The elevation and the surrounding peaks combine to give it a highly changeable climate, and the continuous passage of cloud and wind creates a constantly moving pattern on the surface of the waters. On that surface visions appear to those who seek them in the right frame of mind.<ref>Hilton, Isabel. (1999). ''The Search for the Panchen Lama''. Viking Books. Reprint: Penguin Books. (2000), pp. 39–40. ISBN 0-14-024670-3.</ref>}}

It was here that in 1935, the Regent [[Reting Rinpoche]] received a clear vision of three Tibetan letters and of a monastery with a jade-green and gold roof, and a house with turquoise roof tiles, which led to the discovery of Tenzin Gyatso, the [[14th Dalai Lama]].<ref>Laird (2006), p. 139.</ref><ref>Norbu and Turnbull (1968), pp. 228–230. Reprint: p. 311.</ref><ref>Hilton, Isabel. (1999). ''The Search for the Panchen Lama''. Viking Books. Reprint: Penguin Books. (2000), p. 42. ISBN 0-14-024670-3.</ref>

High Lamas may also have a vision by a dream or if the Dalai Lama was cremated, they will often monitor the direction of the smoke as an indication of the direction of the rebirth.<ref name = "sdpcnw"/>

Once the High Lamas have found the home and the boy they believe to be the reincarnation, the boy undergoes a series of tests to affirm the rebirth. They present a number of artifacts, only some of which belonged to the previous Dalai Lama, and if the boy chooses the items which belonged to the previous Dalai Lama, this is seen as a sign, in conjunction with all of the other indications, that the boy is the reincarnation.<ref name = "artfcts">{{cite web|title=The Dalai Lama's Succession Rethink|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1686573,00.html|publisher=Time World|accessdate=2013-04-06|date=Last updated 2007-11-21}}</ref>

If there is only one boy found, the High Lamas will invite Living Buddhas of the three great monasteries, together with secular clergy and monk officials, to confirm their findings and then report to the Central Government through the Minister of Tibet. Later, a group consisting of the three major servants of Dalai Lama, eminent officials,{{who|date=May 2013}} and troops{{which|date=May 2013}} will collect the boy and his family and travel to [[Lhasa]], where the boy would be taken, usually to [[Drepung Monastery]], to study the Buddhist sutra in preparation for assuming the role of spiritual leader of Tibet.<ref name = "sdpcnw"/>

If there are several possible reincarnations, however, regents, eminent officials, monks at the [[Jokhang]] in [[Lhasa]], and the Minister to Tibet have historically decided on the individual by putting the boys' names inside an urn and drawing one lot in public if it was too difficult to judge the reincarnation initially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dalai Lama's confirmation of reincarnation|url=http://www.tibettravel.info/tibetan-buddhism/confirmation-of-reincarnation.html |publisher=Tibet Travel info|accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref>

There has also been one nonrecognised Dalai Lama, [[Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso]], declared 28 June 1707, when he was 25 years old, by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] as the "true" 6th Dalai Lama – however, he was never accepted as such by the majority of the population.<ref name="Stein 1972, p. 85"/><ref>Chapman, F.

{{quote|In the mid-1970s, Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, told a Polish newspaper that he thought he would be the last Dalai Lama. In a later interview published in the English language press he stated, "The Dalai Lama office was an institution created to benefit others. It is possible that it will soon have outlived its usefulness."<ref>[[Glenn H. Mullin]], "Faces of the Dalai Lama: Reflections on the Man and the Tradition," ''Quest'', vol. 6, no. 3, Autumn 1993, p. 80.</ref> These statements caused a furor amongst Tibetans in India. Many could not believe that such an option could even be considered. It was further felt that it was not the Dalai Lama's decision to reincarnate. Rather, they felt that since the Dalai Lama is a national institution it was up to the people of Tibet to decide whether the Dalai Lama should reincarnate.<ref>Verhaegen (2002), p. 5.</ref>}}

The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) has claimed the power to approve the naming of "high" reincarnations in Tibet, based on a precedent set by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. The Qianlong Emperor instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama and the [[Panchen Lama]] by a lottery that used a golden urn with names wrapped in clumps of barley. This method was used a few times for both positions during the 19th century, but eventually fell into disuse. In 1995, the Dalai Lama chose to proceed with the selection of the [[11th Panchen Lama|11th reincarnation of the Panchen Lama]] without the use of the Golden Urn, while the Chinese government insisted that it must be used. This has led to two rival Panchen Lamas: [[Gyaincain Norbu]] as chosen by the Chinese government's process, and [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] as chosen by the Dalai Lama.

During September 2007 the Chinese government said [[State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5|all high monks must be approved by the government]], which would include the selection of the [[15th Dalai Lama]] after the death of [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]]. Since by tradition, the Panchen Lama must approve the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, that is another possible method of control.

In response to this scenario, [[Tashi Wangdi]], the representative of the [[14th Dalai Lama]], replied that the Chinese government's selection would be meaningless. "You can't impose an [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|Imam]], an [[Archbishop]], saints, any religion...you can't politically impose these things on people," said Wangdi. "It has to be a decision of the followers of that tradition. The Chinese can use their political power: force. Again, it's meaningless. Like their Panchen Lama. And they can't keep their Panchen Lama in Tibet. They tried to bring him to [[Tashilhunpo|his monastery]] many times but people would not see him. How can you have a religious leader like that?"<ref>[[n:Dalai Lama's representative talks about China, Tibet, Shugden and the next Dalai Lama|Interview with Tashi Wangdi]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 14, 2007.</ref>

The Dalai Lama said as early as 1969 that it was for the Tibetans to decide whether the institution of the Dalai Lama "should continue or not".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tibet.com/DL/next-reincarnation.html|publisher=Government of Tibet in Exile|title=Dalai's reincarnation will not be found under Chinese control}}</ref> He has given reference to a possible vote occurring in the future for all Tibetan Buddhists to decide whether they wish to recognize his rebirth.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22838048-25837,00.html Dalai Lama may forgo death before reincarnation], Jeremy Page, ''[[The Australian]]'', November 29, 2007.</ref> In response to the possibility that the PRC may attempt to choose his successor, the Dalai Lama has said he will not be reborn in a country controlled by the People's Republic of China or any other country which is not free.<ref name="sdpcnw"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tibet.com/DL/next-reincarnation.html|publisher=Government of Tibet in Exile ex Indian Express July 6, 1999| title=Dalai's reincarnation will not be found under Chinese control}}</ref> According to [[Robert D. Kaplan]], this could mean that "the next Dalai Lama might come from the Tibetan cultural belt that stretches across northern [[India]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bhutan]], presumably making him even more pro-Indian and anti-Chinese".<ref>[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66205/robert-d-kaplan/the-geography-of-chinese-power Kaplan Robert, Foreign Affairs, "The Geography of Chinese Power"]</ref>
