The '''Economy of Angola''' is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,<ref name="fastest">Birgitte Refslund Sørensen and Marc Vincent. ''Caught Between Borders: Response Strategies of the Internally Displaced'', 2001. Page 17.</ref> with the Economist asserting that for 2001 to 2010, Angolas' Annual average GDP growth was 11.1 percent.<ref>http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart Retrieved on January 6, 2011</ref> It is still recovering from the [[Angolan Civil War]] that plagued Angola from [[Alvor Agreement|independence in 1975]] until 2002. Despite extensive [[Crude oil|oil and gas]] resources, [[diamond]]s, hydroelectric potential, and rich agricultural land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Since 2002, when the 27-year civil war ended, the country has worked to repair and improve ravaged infrastructure and weakened political and social institutions. High international oil prices and rising oil production have contributed to the very strong economic growth since 1998,<ref>[[Google Public Data]]. Retrieved 2013-8-14.</ref> but corruption and public-sector mismanagement remain, particularly in the oil sector, which accounts for over 50 percent of GDP, over 90 percent of export revenue, and over 80 percent of government revenue.

==History==
[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]'s explorers and settlers founded trading posts and forts along the coast of [[Africa]] beginning in the 15th century, and reached the [[Angola]]n coast in the 16th century. Portuguese explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded [[Luanda]] in 1575 as "São Paulo de Loanda", and the region developed as a [[Slavery in Angola|slave trade]] market with the help of local [[Imbangala]] and [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] peoples who were [[Slavery in Africa|notable slave hunters]]. Trade was mostly with the Portuguese [[colony of Brazil]]; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony. A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the [[Jesuits]] in religion and education. War gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade. The great trade routes and the agreements that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; warlike states become states ready to produce and to sell. In the Planalto (the high plains), the most important states were those of [[Bié Province|Bié]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The colonial power, Portugal, becoming ever richer and more powerful, would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one, so that by the beginning of this century the Portuguese had complete control over the entire area. During the period of the [[Iberian Union]] (1580–1640), Portugal lost influence and power and made new enemies. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], a major enemy of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions, including [[Luanda]]. The Dutch ruled Luanda from 1640 to 1648 as Fort Aardenburgh. They were seeking black slaves for use in [[sugarcane]] plantations of [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] ([[Pernambuco]], [[Olinda]], [[Recife]]) which they had also seized from Portugal. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], conquered the Portuguese possessions of [[Elmina|Saint George del Mina]], Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

The Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. Meanwhile, with the [[independence of Brazil]] in 1822, the slave trade was abolished in 1836, and in 1844 Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping. By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast [[Portuguese Empire]] outside [[Mainland Portugal]], full of trading companies, exporting (together with [[Benguela]]) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products. Maize, tobacco, dried meat and cassava flour also began to be produced locally. The Angolan bourgeoisie was born. From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastructure, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers.

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] discovered [[petroleum]] in Angola in 1955. Production began in the [[Cuanza basin]] in the 1950s, in the [[Congo basin]] in the 1960s, and in the [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] in 1968. The [[Portuguese government]] granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of [[ChevronTexaco]], in 1955.<ref name="opec"/> Oil production surpassed the exportation of [[coffee]] as Angola's largest export in 1973.

A leftist military-led coup d'état, started on April 25, 1974, in Lisbon, overthrew the [[Marcelo Caetano]] government in Portugal, and promised to hand over power to an independent Angolan government. [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], the [[President of Zaire]], met with [[António de Spínola]], the transitional [[President of Portugal]], on September 15, 1974 on [[Sal island]] in [[Cape Verde]], crafting a plan to empower [[Holden Roberto]] of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], [[Jonas Savimbi]] of [[UNITA]], and [[Daniel Chipenda]] of the [[MPLA]]'s eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader [[Agostinho Neto]] while retaining the façade of national unity. Mobutu and Spínola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. The Angolan [[exclave]] has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around 300 million tons (~300{{e|9}}&nbsp;kg) which Zaire, and thus the Mobutu government, depended on for economic survival.<ref name="petroleum">Erik P. Hoffmann and Frederic J. Fleron. ''The Conduct of Soviet Foreign Policy'', 1980. Page 524.</ref> After independence thousands of white Portuguese left, most of them to [[Portugal]] and many travelling overland to [[South Africa]]. There was an immediate crisis because the indigenous African population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the country and maintain its well-developed infrastructure.

The Angolan government created [[Sonangol]], a state-run oil company, in 1976. Two years later Sonangol received the rights to oil exploration and production in all of Angola.<ref name="opec">[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Angola/pdf.pdf Angola] Energy Information Administration</ref> After independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was ravaged by a horrific [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] between 1975 and 2002.

===1990s===
[[United Nations Angola Verification Mission III]] and [[MONUA]] spent [[USD]]1.5 billion overseeing implementation of the [[Lusaka Protocol]], a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war. The protocol prohibited UNITA from buying foreign arms, a provision the [[United Nations]] largely did not enforce, so both sides continued to build up their stockpile. UNITA purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in [[Albania]] and [[Bulgaria]], and from [[Zaire]], [[South Africa]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Zambia]], [[Togo]], and [[Burkina Faso]]. In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited until July 1998 to limit UNITA's exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts. While the U.S. government gave USD250 million to UNITA between 1986 to 1991, UNITA made USD1.72 billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe. At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of [[Belarus]], [[Brazil]], Bulgaria, the [[China]], and [[South Africa]]. While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons as required.<ref name="lusaka">Vines, Alex. ''Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process'', 1999. Human Rights Watch.</ref>

Despite the increase in civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===2000s===
An economic reform effort was launched in 1998.<ref>"[[Angola.]]" U.S. Department of State Website.

The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged. In this context the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates. The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized. A privatization effort, prepared with [[World Bank]] assistance, has begun with the [[Banco do Comércio e Indústria|BCI]] bank. Nevertheless, a legacy of fiscal mismanagement and corruption persists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The civil war [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced]] 3.8 million people, 32% of the population, by 2001.<ref name="fastest"/> The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The construction industry is another sector taking advantage of the growing economy, with various housing projects stimulated by the government that created various initiatives for this. Examples are the program ''Angola Investe'' and the projects ''[[Grupo Opaia SA#Casa Feliz|Casa Feliz]]'' or ''[[Grupo Opaia SA#Opaia Águas (Water)|Meña]]''. However, not all public construction projects are functional; a case in point is [[Kilamba Kiaxi]] where a whole new satellite town of Luanda, consisting in the main of housing faclities for several hundreds of thousands of people, remains practically uninhabited, because of prices that are out of reach even for the middle class.

ChevronTexaco started pumping {{convert|50|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} from Block 14 in January 2000, but production has decreased to {{convert|57|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in 2007 due to the poor quality of the oil.<ref name="opec"/> Angola joined the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] on January 1, 2007.<ref name="opec"/>

Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed {{convert|1.4|Moilbbl/d}} in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d}} by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in [[Sonangol Group]], a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. With revenues booming from oil exports, the government has started to implement ambitious development programs in building roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food. Because of severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, agricultural activities have been brought to a near standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. [[Coffee]] production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. In sharp contrast to a bleak picture of devastation and bare subsistence is expanding oil production, now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at {{convert|800|koilbbl/d}}. Diamonds provided much of the revenue for [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s [[UNITA]] rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and fruits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Petroleum===
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Angola.jpeg|thumb|Angolan exports in 2009]]
Angola produces and exports more petroleum than any other nation in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], surpassing [[Nigeria]] in the [[2000s in Angola|2000s]]. In January 2007 Angola became a member of [[OPEC]]. By 2010 production is expected to double the 2006 output level with development of deep-water offshore oil fields. Oil sales generated USD&nbsp;1.71 billion in tax revenue in 2004 and now makes up 80% of the government's budget, a 5% increase from 2003, and 45% of [[GDP]].<ref name="oilview"/><ref name="budgincrease">OECD (2006). Page 30.</ref>

[[Chevron Corporation]] produces and receives {{convert|400|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}}, 27% of Angolan oil. [[Total S.A.]], [[Chevron Corporation]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Eni]], [[Petrobras]], and [[BP]] also operate in the country.<ref name="oilhistory"/>

Block Zero provides the majority of Angola's crude oil production<ref name="zero">OECD (2006). Page 132.</ref> with {{convert|370|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} produced annually<!-- per day per year ...? -->. The largest fields in Block Zero are Takula (Area A), Numbi (Area A), and Kokongo (Area B). Chevron operates in Block Zero with a 39.2% share. [[SONANGOL]], the state oil company, Total, and Eni own the rest of the block. Chevron also operates Angola's first producing deepwater section, Block 14, with {{convert|57|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.<ref name="opec"/>

===Diamonds===
{{Main|Mining in Angola}}
Angola is the third largest producer of diamonds in Africa and has only explored 40% of the diamond-rich territory within the country, but has had difficulty in attracting foreign investment because of corruption, human rights violations, and diamond smuggling.<ref name="cfr">[http://allafrica.com/stories/200705071105.html Angola: U.S. Must Strengthen Ties to Protect Strategic Energy and Security Interests] Council on Foreign Relations via AllAfrica</ref> Production rose by 30% in 2006 and [[Endiama]], the national diamond company of Angola, expects production to increase by 8% in 2007 to 10 million carats annually. The government is trying to attract foreign companies to the [[Provinces of Angola|provinces]] of [[Bié (province)|Bié]], [[Malanje (province)|Malanje]] and [[Uíge Province|Uíge]].<ref name="diaexploration">[http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN637551.html Angola wants foreign investors for diamond sector], July 26, 2007. Reuters</ref>

The Angolan government loses $375 million annually from diamond smuggling. In 2003 the government began Operation Brilliant, an anti-smuggling investigation that arrested and deported 250,000 smugglers between 2003 and 2006. Rafael Marques, a journalist and human rights activist, described the diamond industry in his 2006 ''Angola's Deadly Diamonds'' report as plagued by "murders, beatings, arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations." Marques called on foreign countries to boycott Angola's "[[conflict diamonds]]".<ref name="marques">[http://www.afrol.com/articles/15888 Angola to double diamond production in 2006] Afrol News</ref>

===Iron===
{{Main|Mining in Angola}}
Under Portuguese rule, [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] began mining [[iron]] in 1957, producing 1.2 million tons in 1967 and 6.2 million tons by 1971. In the early 1970s, 70% of Portuguese Angola's iron exports went to [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]].<ref name="diaexploration"/> After independence in 1975, the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002) destroyed most of the territory's mining infrastructure. The redevelopment of the Angolan mining industry started in the late 2000s.
