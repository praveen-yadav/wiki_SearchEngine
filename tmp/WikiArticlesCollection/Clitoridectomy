'''Clitoridectomy''' or '''clitorectomy''' is the [[surgery|surgical]] removal of the [[clitoris]]. It is rarely needed as a therapeutic medical procedure, such as when [[cancer]] has developed in or spread to the clitoris. Most removals of the clitoris occur as [[female genital mutilation]], defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reasons."<ref>{{cite press release

Clitoral reconstructive surgery was developed by French surgeon [[Pierre Foldès]]. It has been clinically proven to allow women who have undergone female genital mutilation by clitoridectomy, to achieve clitoral orgasms and reduce pain.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Foldes|first=Pierre|coauthors=Beatrice Cuzin, Armelle Andro|title=Reconstructive surgery after female genital mutilation: a prospective cohort study|journal=The Lanclet|date=14|year=2012|month=July|volume=380|issue=9837|pages=134–141|pmid=22695031|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960400-0/abstract|accessdate=15 July 2012|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60400-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Barclay|first=Elizabeth|title=Surgery Restores Sexual Function In Women With Genital Mutilation|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/06/13/154924715/surgery-restores-sexual-function-in-women-with-genital-mutilation|work=NPR|accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref> One organization, [[Campaign Against Female Genital Mutilation]] (CAGeM), offers this surgical treatment for free to victims of female genital mutilation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Azango|first=Mae|title=‘Can’t Wait to Feel Like a Real Woman Again’: Clitoris Reconstruction for African Pair|url=http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3637:cant-wait-to-feel-like-a-real-woman-again-clitoris-reconstruction-pair&catid=67:news&Itemid=144|accessdate=4 September 2012|newspaper=Front Page Africa Online|date=July 15, 2012}}</ref>

== Historical use of clitoridectomy ==
Clitoridectomy was once used to curb [[Masturbation#Female|female masturbation]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.1963.63710030028012|last=Duffy|first=John|date=October 19, 1963|title=Masturbation and Clitoridectomy: A Nineteenth-Century View|journal=JAMA|volume=186|issue=3|pages=246–248|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=667217|pmid=14057114}}</ref>  Gynaecologists in 19th-century Europe and the United States removed the clitoris to treat insanity and masturbation.<ref>Rodriguez, Sarah W.

[[Isaac Baker Brown]] (1812–1873), an English gynaecologist who was president of the [[Medical Society of London]] in 1865, believed that the "unnatural irritation" of the clitoris caused epilepsy, hysteria and mania, and worked "to remove [it] whenever he had the opportunity of doing so," according to his obituary in the ''Medical Times and Gazette''. [[Peter Lewis Allen]] writes that Brown's views caused outrage, and he died penniless after being expelled from the Obstetrical Society.<ref>[[Peter Lewis Allen|Allen, Peter Lewis]].
