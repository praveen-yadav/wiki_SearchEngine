The '''central nervous system''' ('''CNS''') is the part of the [[nervous system]] that integrates the information that it receives from, and coordinates the activity of, all parts of the bodies of [[bilaterian]] animals—that is, all multicellular animals except [[radiata|radially symmetric animals]] such as [[sponge]]s and [[jellyfish]]. It contains the majority of the nervous system and consists of the [[brain]] and the [[spinal cord]]. Some classifications also include the [[retina]]<ref name="Purves 2000">{{cite isbn|9780878937424}}</ref> and the [[optic nerve|second cranial nerve]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): Optic Nerve|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68009900|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=28 September 2013}}</ref> as parts of the CNS. Together with the [[peripheral nervous system]], it has a fundamental role in the control of [[behavior]]. The CNS is contained within the [[dorsal cavity]], with the [[brain]] in the [[cranial cavity]] and the spinal cord in the [[spinal cavity]]. In [[vertebrate]]s, the brain is protected by the skull, while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae, and both are enclosed in the [[meninges]].<ref>

==Development==
[[File:Development of the neural tube.png|thumb|right|Development of the neural tube]]
{{Main|Neural development}}
{{Further|Neuroanatomy}}
During early development of the vertebrate embryo, a longitudinal [[neural groove|groove]] on the [[neural plate]] gradually deepens and the ridges on either side of the groove (the [[neural folds]]) become elevated, and ultimately meet, transforming the groove into a [[neural tube|closed tube]], the [[ectoderm]]al wall of which forms the rudiment of the nervous system. This tube initially differentiates into three [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] (pockets): the [[prosencephalon]] at the front, the [[mesencephalon]], and, between the mesencephalon and the spinal cord, the [[rhombencephalon]]. (By six weeks in the human embryo) the prosencephalon then divides further into the [[telencephalon]] and [[diencephalon]]; and the rhombencephalon divides into the [[metencephalon]] and [[myelencephalon]].

As a vertebrate grows, these vesicles differentiate further still. The telencephalon differentiates into, among other things, the [[striatum]], the [[hippocampus]] and the [[neocortex]], and its cavity becomes the [[lateral ventricles|first and second ventricles]]. Diencephalon elaborations include the [[subthalamus]], [[hypothalamus]], [[thalamus]] and [[epithalamus]], and its cavity forms the [[third ventricle]]. The [[tectum]], [[pretectum]], [[cerebral peduncle]] and other structures develop out of the mesencephalon, and its cavity grows into the [[mesencephalic duct]] (cerebral aqueduct). The metencephalon becomes, among other things, the [[pons]] and the [[cerebellum]], the myelencephalon forms the [[medulla oblongata]], and their cavities develop into the fourth ventricle.

[[Planarians]], members of the phylum [[Platyhelminthes]] (flatworms), have the simplest, clearly defined delineation of a nervous system into a central nervous system (CNS) and a [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS).<ref>{{cite book

Their primitive brain, consisting of two fused anterior ganglia, and longitudinal nerve cords form the CNS; the laterally projecting nerves form the PNS. A molecular study found that more than 95% of the 116 genes involved in the nervous system of planarians, which includes genes related to the CNS, also exist in humans.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Katsuhiko Mineta, et al.|title=Origin and evolutionary process of the CNS elucidated by comparative genomics analysis of planarian ESTs|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/13/7666.full.pdf+html?sid=b2a914e7-5647-4ee2-835c-bc54c4927a98|journal=PNAS|format = pdf|volume=100|issue=13|pages=7666–7671|year=2003|doi=10.1073/pnas.1332513100|pmid=12802012|pmc=164645|last2=Nakazawa|first2=M|last3=Cebria|first3=F|last4=Ikeo|first4=K|last5=Agata|first5=K|last6=Gojobori|first6=T}}</ref> Like planarians, vertebrates have a distinct CNS and PNS, though more complex than those of planarians.

The CNS of [[chordate]]s differs from that of other animals in being placed dorsally in the body, above the gut and [[notochord]]/[[Vertebral column|spine]].<ref name=Romer>Romer, A.S. (1949): ''The Vertebrate Body.'' W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia. (2nd ed. 1955; 3rd ed. 1962; 4th ed. 1970)</ref> The basic pattern of the CNS is highly conserved throughout the different species of [[vertebrate]]s and during evolution. The major trend that can be observed is towards a progressive telencephalisation: the [[telencephalon]] of reptiles is only an appendix to the large [[olfactory bulb]], while in mammals it makes up most of the volume of the CNS. In the human brain, the telencephalon covers most of the [[diencephalon]] and the [[mesencephalon]]. Indeed, the [[allometry|allometric]] study of brain size among different species shows a striking continuity from rats to whales, and allows us to complete the knowledge about the evolution of the CNS obtained through [[cranial endocast]]s.

[[Mammal]]s – which appear in the fossil record after the first fishes, amphibians, and reptiles – are the only vertebrates to possess the evolutionarily recent, outermost part of the [[cerebral cortex]] known as the [[neocortex]].<ref name=MarkFBear>{{cite book

Within placental mammals, the size and complexity of the neocortex increased over time. The area of the neocortex of mice is only about 1/100 that of monkeys, and that of monkeys is only about 1/10 that of humans.<ref name=MarkFBear>198</ref> In addition, rats lack convolutions in their neocortex (possibly also because rats are small mammals), whereas cats have a moderate degree of convolutions, and humans have quite extensive convolutions.<ref name=MarkFBear>199</ref> Extreme convolution of the neocortex is found in [[dolphin]]s, possibly related to their complex [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]].

==Diseases of the central nervous system==
{{main|Central nervous system disease}}
There are many central nervous system diseases, including [[List of central nervous system infections|infections]] of the central nervous system such as [[encephalitis]] and [[poliomyelitis]], early-onset [[neurological disorders]] including [[ADHD]] and [[autism]], late-onset [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative diseases]] such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[essential tremor]], [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] and inflammatory diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]], genetic disorders such as [[Krabbe's disease]] and [[Huntington's disease]], as well as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] and [[adrenoleukodystrophy]]. Lastly, cancers of the central nervous system can cause severe illness and, when [[Malignant brain tumor|malignant]], can have very high mortality rates.

[[Specialty (medicine)|Specialty]] professional organizations recommend that neurological imaging of the brain be done only to answer a specific clinical question and not as routine screening.<ref name="ACRASNRcomtom">{{Cite document |author1=American College of Radiology |author2=American Society of Neuroradiology |date=2010 |title =ACR-ASNR practice guideline for the performance of computed tomography (CT) of the brain |publisher = [[American College of Radiology]] |work=[[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] |publication-place =Reston, VA, USA |page = |url =http://www.guidelines.gov/content.aspx?id=32518 |accessdate =9 September 2012 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.
