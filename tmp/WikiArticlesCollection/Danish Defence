The [[armed forces]] of the [[Denmark|Kingdom of Denmark]], known as the '''Danish Defence''' ({{lang-da|Forsvaret}}) is charged with the defence of Denmark and its overseas territories, [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]].

[[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] is the [[de jure]] [[Commander-in-Chief]] per the Danish constitution, however according to the Danish Defence Law<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=6294 | title = LOV nr 122 af 27/02/2001 om forsvarets formål, opgaver og organisation m.v. | accessdate = 2012-07-30 | language = Danish}}</ref> the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Minister of Defence]] serves as the commander of the Danish Defence (through the [[Chief of Defence (Denmark)|Chief of Defence]] and the [[Defence Command (Denmark)|Defence Command]]) and the [[Danish Home Guard]] (through the [[Home Guard Command (Denmark)|Home Guard Command]]). [[De facto]] the Danish Cabinet is the commanding authority of the Defence, though it cannot mobilize the armed forces, for purposes that are not strictly defence oriented, without the consent of [[Parliament of Denmark|parliament]].

Denmark also has a concept of "total defence" ({{lang-da|Totalforsvar}}).<ref name="DDA">{{cite web|url=http://forsvaret.dk/FKO/eng/Defence%20Agreement/Pages/default.aspx|title=The Danish Defence Agreement 2005 - 2009  |year=2009|work=Danish Defence|publisher=Defence Command Denmark|accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>

==Purpose and task==
The purpose and task of the armed forces of Denmark is defined in Law no. 122 of February 27, 2001 and in force since March 1, 2001. It defines three purposes and six tasks.

Its primary purpose is to prevent conflicts and war, preserve the [[sovereignty]] of Denmark, secure the continuing existence and integrity of the independent Kingdom of Denmark and further a peaceful development in the world with respect to human rights.

Its primary tasks are: [[NATO]] participation in accordance with the strategy of the alliance, detect and repel any sovereignty violation of Danish territory (including [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), defence cooperation with non-NATO members, especially Central and East European countries, international missions in the area of conflict prevention, crises-control, humanitarian, peacemaking, peacekeeping, participation in ''Total Defence''{{clarify|reason=What is "Total Defence"—the article does not define it.|date=January 2013}} in cooperation with civilian resources and finally maintenance of a sizable force to execute these tasks at all times.

==Defence budget==
Since 1988, Danish defence budgets and security policy have been set by multi-year agreements supported by a wide parliamentary majority including government and opposition parties. However, public opposition to increases in defence spending—during a period when economic constraints require reduced spending for social welfare—has created differences among the political parties regarding a broadly acceptable level of new defence expenditure.

The latest Defence agreement ("[[Danish Defence agreement 2005-2009|Defence agreement 2005–2009]]") was signed June 10, 2004, and calls for a significant re-construction of the entire military. From now about 60% support structure and 40% combat operational capability, it is to be 40% support structure and 60% combat operational capability, i.e. more combat soldiers and fewer "paper"-soldiers.
The reaction speed is increased, with an entire [[brigade]] on standby readiness; the military retains the capability to continually deploy 2,000 soldiers in international service or 5,000 over a short time span. The standard mandatory [[conscription]] is modified. Generally this means fewer conscripts, less service time for them and only those who choose so, will continue into the reaction force system.

===Expenditures===
In 2006 the Danish military budget was the fifth largest single portion of the Danish Government's total budget, significantly less than that of the [[Ministry of Social Affairs of Denmark|Ministry of Social Affairs]] (~110 billion [[Danish krone|DKK]]), [[Ministry of Employment of Denmark|Ministry of Employment]] (~67 billion DKK), [[Ministry of the Interior and Health of Denmark|Ministry of the Interior and Health]] (~66 billion DKK) and [[Ministry of Education of Denmark|Ministry of Education]] (~30 billion DKK) and only slightly larger than that of the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]] (~14 billion DKK). This list lists the complete expenditures for the Danish [[Ministry of Defence of Denmark|Ministry of Defence]].

The Danish Defence, counting all branches and all departments, itself has an income equal to about 1&ndash;5% of its expenditures, depending on the year. They are not deducted in this listing.

Approximately 95% of the budget goes directly to running the Danish military including the Home guard. Depending on year, 50&ndash;53% accounts for payment to personnel, roughly 14&ndash;21% on acquiring new material, 2&ndash;8% for larger ships, building projects or infrastructure and about 24&ndash;27% on other items, including purchasing of goods, renting, maintenance, services and taxes.

The remaining 5% is special expenditures to NATO, branch shared expenditures, special services and civil structures, here in including running the [[Danish Maritime Safety Administration]], [[Danish National Rescue Preparedness|Danish national rescue preparedness]] and the Administration of Conscientious Objectors ([http://militaernaegter.dk Militærnægteradministrationen]).

Because Denmark has a small and highly specialized military industry, the vast majority of the Danish Defence's equipment is imported from NATO and the [[Nordic countries]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
