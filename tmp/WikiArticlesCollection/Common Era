'''BCE''' is the abbreviation for '''Before the Common/Current/Christian Era''' (an alternative to Before Christ, abbreviated BC).
The CE/BCE designation uses the year-numbering system introduced by the 6th-century [[Christian monasticism|Christian monk]] [[Dionysius Exiguus]], who started the ''Anno Domini'' designation, intending the beginning of the life of [[Jesus]]<ref>It is unclear whether Dionysius intended this to be the [[annunciation|conception]] or [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]] of [[Jesus]], or if it would make a difference in counting the years.</ref> to be the [[Epoch (reference date)|reference date]].<ref>

Neither notation includes a [[year zero]],<ref>
Two separate systems that also do not use religious titles, the [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical system]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard, do use a year zero. The year 1 BCE (identical to the year 1 BC) is represented as 0 in the astronomical system, and as 0000 in ISO 8601. Presently, ISO 8601 dating requires use of the Gregorian calendar for all dates, however; whereas astronomical dating and Common Era dating allow use of the Julian calendar for dates before 1582 CE.
</ref>
and the two notations (CE/BCE and AD/BC) are numerically equivalent; thus "{{currentyear}} CE" corresponds to "AD {{currentyear}}", and "399 BCE" corresponds to "399 BC".

The expression "Common Era" can be found as early as 1708 in English,<ref name=1708CommonInEnglish/> and traced back to Latin usage among European Christians to 1615, as ''vulgaris aerae'',<ref name=VulgarisAerae1/> and to 1635 in English as ''Vulgar Era''. At those times, the expressions were all used interchangeably with "Christian Era", and "vulgar" meant "not regal" rather than "crudely indecent". Use of the CE abbreviation was introduced by Jewish academics in the mid-19th century. Since the later 20th century, use of CE and BCE has been popularized in academic and scientific publications, and more generally by publishers emphasizing [[secularism]] or sensitivity to non-Christians.

The [[Gregorian calendar]] and the year-numbering system associated with it is the calendar system with most widespread use in the world today. For decades, it has been the global standard, recognized by international institutions such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Universal Postal Union]].

The CE/BCE notation has been adopted by some authors and publishers wishing to be
neutral or sensitive to non-Christians<ref name=Irvin /><ref>

==History==

===Origins===
{{See also|Anno Domini}}
The year numbering system used with Common Era notation was devised by the Christian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the year 525 to replace the [[Era of Martyrs]] system, because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref name=Pedersen /> He attempted to number years from an event he referred to as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of [[Christ|Jesus]],<ref name=Pedersen />
although scholars today generally agree that he miscalculated by a small number of years.<ref>Doggett, L.E., (1992), [http://charon.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html "Calendars"] in Seidelmann, P.K., ''The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', Sausalito CA: University Science Books, p. 579.

</ref>
Dionysius labeled the column of the Easter table in which he introduced the new era "''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi''".<ref>Pedersen, O., (1983), "The Ecclesiastical Calendar and the Life of the Church" in Coyne, G.V. et al. (Eds.) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/book/grc../1983//0000052.000.html ''The Gregorian Reform of the Calendar''], Vatican Observatory, p. 52.
</ref>
Numbering years in this manner became more widespread with its usage by [[Bede]] in England in 731. Bede also introduced the practice of dating years before the supposed year of birth<ref>Bede wrote of the Incarnation of Jesus, but treated it as synonymous with birth. Blackburn, B & Holford-Strevens, L, (2003), ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', Oxford University Press, 778.
</ref>
of Jesus, and the practice of not using a year zero.<ref>As noted in [[Zero#History]], the use of zero in Western civilization was uncommon before the 12th century.
</ref>
In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to]] the system begun by Dionysius.<ref name=CathEncy-Chron />

===Use of the term "vulgar era"===
The term "Common Era" is traced back in English to its appearance as "Vulgar Era"<ref>from the Latin word ''vulgus'', the common people, i.e. those who are not royalty.
It is relatively recently the word ''vulgar'' has come to mean "crudely indecent". Common fractions are still often referred to as vulgar fractions, without any implication of crudeness.
</ref>
to distinguish it from the [[Regnal year|regnal dating]] systems typically used in national law.
The first use of the Latin equivalent (''vulgaris aerae'')<ref name=VulgarisAerae0>In Latin, ''Common Era'' is written as ''Vulgaris Aerae''. It also occasionally appears as ''æræ vulgaris'', ''aerae vulgaris'', ''aeram vulgarem'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aerae Christianae'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.
</ref>
discovered so far was in a 1615 book by [[Johannes Kepler]].<ref name=VulgarisAerae1
/>
Kepler uses it again in a 1616 table of [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]],<ref name=VulgarisAerae2>

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1909) used the terms "Christian, Vulgar or Common Era" interchangeably.<ref>"Foremost among these [various eras] is that which is now adopted by all civilized peoples and known as the Christian, Vulgar or Common Era, in the twentieth century of which we are now living".</ref>

The phrase "common era", in [[lower case]], also appeared in the 19th century in a ''generic'' sense, not necessarily to refer to the Christian Era, but to any system of dates in common use throughout a civilization. Thus, "the common era of the Jews",<ref>

An adapted translation of ''Common Era'' into Latin as ''Era Vulgaris'' was adopted in the 20th century by some followers of [[Aleister Crowley]], and thus the abbreviation "e.v." or "EV" may sometimes be seen as a replacement for AD.<ref>

===History of the use of the CE/BCE abbreviation===
Although Jews have their own [[Hebrew calendar]], they often use the Gregorian calendar.<ref>{{cite web | quote=Jews do not generally use the words "A.D." and "B.C." to refer to the years on the Gregorian calendar. "A.D." means "the year of our [[L-rd]]," and we do not believe Jesus is the L-rd.  Instead, we use the abbreviations C.E. (Common or Christian Era) and B.C.E. (Before the Common Era). | author=Tracey R Rich | url=http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm#Years | title=Judaism 101 | accessdate=2011-05-18}}</ref>

As early as 1825, the abbreviation VE (for Vulgar Era) was in use among Jews to denote years on the Western calendar.<ref>

<br />[19 Sivan 5585 [[Anno Mundi|AM]] is June 5, 1825. VE is likely an abbreviation for ''Vulgar Era''.]</ref>

Common Era notation has also been in use for Hebrew lessons for "more than a century".<ref name=Gormley />
Some Jewish academics were already using the ''CE'' and ''BCE'' abbreviations by the mid-19th century, such as in 1856, when Rabbi and historian [[Morris Jacob Raphall]] used the abbreviation in his book, [http://books.google.com/books?id=r7CbDH5hTe8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=CE+BCE ''Post-Biblical History of The Jews''].<ref>
The term ''common era'' does not appear in this book; the term ''Christian era'' [lowercase] does appear a number of times. Nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or expanded directly.

in books has changed dramatically between the years 1800 and 2008, particularly since 1980, with the CE-related variants increasing in usage.

===Contemporary usage===
Some academics in the fields of [[theology]], [[education]] and [[history]] have adopted CE and BCE notation, although there is some disagreement.<ref>See, for example, the Society for Historical Archaeology states in its more recent style guide "Do not use C.E. (current era) ... or B.C.E.; convert these expressions to A.D. and B.C." {{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/publications/style_guide.htm#V-d |title=Style Guide |author=Society for Historical Archaeology |month=December |year=2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070618004627/http://www.sha.org/publications/style_guide.htm#V-d <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> | archivedate=2007-06-18 | accessdate=2011-05-18}}.

</ref>
The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, which is the leading publishing body of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], has been using CE and BCE exclusively in its publications (except in quotations and in ''The Watchtower—[[Simplified English]] Edition'') since ''[[The Watchtower]]'' of 15 April 1964.<ref>Watchtower Library 2009, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.

More visible uses of Common Era notation have recently surfaced at major museums in the English-speaking world: The [[Smithsonian Institution]] prefers Common Era usage, though individual museums are not required to use it.<ref>
{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/field_trips/standards/world_history_standards.html |title=World History Standards |accessdate=2006-09-09 |author=Smithsonian Institution |work=Smithsonian Education |archiveurl = http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070928000917/http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/field_trips/standards/world_history_standards.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate =2006-09-06}}
</ref>
Furthermore, several style guides now prefer or mandate its usage.<ref>

</ref>
Even some style guides for Christian churches prefer its use: for example, the Episcopal Diocese ''Maryland Church News''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |title=Maryland Church News Submission Guide & Style Manual |work=Maryland Church News |format=PDF |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}</ref>

In the United States, the usage of the BCE/CE notation in [[textbook]]s is growing.<ref name=Gormley /> Some publications have moved over to using it exclusively. For example, the 2007 World Almanac was the first edition to switch over to the BCE/CE usage, ending a 138-year usage of the traditional BC/AD dating notation. It is used by the [[College Board]] in its history tests,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_world/topic.html?worldhist |title=AP: World History |accessdate=2011-05-18}}
</ref>
and by the [[Norton Anthology of English Literature]].
Others have taken a different approach. The US-based [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] uses BCE/CE notation in articles on non-Christian religious topics such as [[Religious significance of Jerusalem#Jerusalem, Jews and Judaism|Jerusalem and Judaism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem Timeline |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18}};{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem: Biographies |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18}}

In June 2006, the Kentucky State School Board reversed its decision that would have included the designations BCE and CE as part of state law, leaving education of students about these concepts a matter of discretion at the local level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |title=State School Board reverses itself on B.C./A.D. controversy |publisher=Family Foundation of Kentucky |accessdate=2011-05-18}}

In 2002, the BCE/CE notation system was introduced into the school curriculum in [[England and Wales]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |title=AD and BC become CE/BCE |date=9 February 2002|accessdate=2012-02-05}}

In 2011 in the UK, the BBC announced it would be using CE/BCE notation on its programmes and website, permitting usage of either notation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/26/1 |title=Reality check: has the BBC dropped the terms BC/AD? |date=26 September 2011|accessdate=2012-02-05}}

Numerous British universities, museums, historians, and book retailers have either dropped BC and AD entirely or are using it alongside the BCE/CE notation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2044219/Government-save-Year-Lord-BBCs-Common-Era.html |title=Government to save Year of our Lord from BBC's 'Common Era' |date=2 October 2011|accessdate=2012-02-05}}
</ref>
Also in 2011, media reports suggested that the BC/AD notation in Australian school textbooks would be replaced by BCE/CE notation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2033225/Australia-goes-PC-ban-BC-Birth-Jesus-removed-reference-point-dates-school-history-books.html |title=Australia goes all PC with a ban on BC: Birth of Jesus to be removed as reference point for dates in school history books |date=2 September 2011|accessdate=2012-02-05}}
</ref>
The story became national news and drew opposition from some politicians and church leaders. Weeks after the story broke, the [[Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority]] denied the rumour and stated that the BC/AD notation would remain, with CE and BCE as an optional suggested learning activity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/adbc-rock-solid-in-curriculum-20111020-1mab2.html |title=AD/BC rock solid in curriculum |date=21 October 2011|accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref>

==Rationale==

===Support===
With respect to the use of CE in Jewish scholarship, it was historically motivated by the desire to avoid the implicit "Our Lord" in the abbreviation ''AD''. Although other aspects of dating systems are based in Christian origins too, AD stands out as a particularly direct reference to Jesus as Lord.

Proponents of the Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by [[Christianity|Christians]], but who are not themselves Christian.<ref name="RelTolrnc
"/>
Former United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] argued, "[T]he Christian calendar no longer belongs exclusively to Christians. People of all faiths have taken to using it simply as a matter of convenience. There is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures – different civilizations, if you like – that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity. And so the Christian Era has become the Common Era."<ref>

It has been noted that the label ''Anno Domini'' is arguably inaccurate; "scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before A.D. 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating."<ref>{{cite book |last=Doggett |first=L. |chapter=Calendars |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |year=1992 |publisher=University Science Books |location=Sausalito, CA |isbn=0-935702-68-7 |editor=P. Kenneth Seidelmann |page=579}}</ref>

===Opposition===
Some oppose the Common Era notation for explicitly religious reasons. Because the BC/AD notation is based on the traditional year of the conception or birth of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], removing reference to him in era notation is offensive to some Christians.<ref>

The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] supports retaining the BC/AD abbreviations as "a reminder of the preeminence of Christ and His gospel in world history".<ref name=SBC />  The Convention has criticized the use of BCE and CE as being the result of "secularization, anti-supernaturalism, religious pluralism, and political correctness" and encourages its members to "retain the traditional method of dating and avoid this revisionism".<ref name=SBC />

There are also secular concerns. English language expert [[Kenneth G. Wilson (author)|Kenneth G. Wilson]] speculated in his style guide that "if we do end by casting aside the A.D./B.C. convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system [that is, the method of numbering years] itself, given its Christian basis."<ref name=Wilson />
The short lived [[French Revolutionary Calendar]], for example, began with the first year of the [[First French Republic]] and rejected the seven-day week (with its connections to Genesis) for a ten-day week.

Astrobiologist [[Duncan Steel]] argues further that if one is going to replace BC/AD with BCE/CE then one should reject all aspects of the dating system (including time of day, days of the week and months of the year), as they all have origins related to pagan, astrological, Jewish, or Christian beliefs. He rejects secular arguments against Christian-based BC/AD as selective. Steel makes note of the consistency of the [[Quaker#Calendar and church holidays|Quaker system]] (now rarely used), which removed all such references.<ref name="Steel" /><ref name=RelTolrnc/>

Anthropologist [[Carol Delaney]] argues that the substitution of BC/AD to BCE/CE is merely a [[euphemism]] that conceals the political implications without modifying the actual source of contention.<ref name=Delaney2004>

[[Raimon Panikkar]] contends that using the designation BCE/CE is a "return... to the most bigoted Christian colonialism"  towards non-Christians, who do not necessarily consider the time period following the beginning of the calendar to be a "common era".<ref name=Panikkar>

|quote=Here is an example of the incarnation's historical-sociological implications among those who feel themselves furthest from Christianity. In certain North American academic circles one can see a return-with repercussions elsewhere-to the most bigoted Christian colonialism, along with the good intention of overcoming it. It has been suggested that the terminology of the Western calendar, Christian in origin, be replaced by one that presumably would be neutral and universal. It is understandable that some would protest the use of A.D. (anno Domini), but by eliminating B.C. (before Christ) and substituting B.C.E. (Before the Common Era) scholars betray the depths of the cultural impact of the historico-Christian event. After all, Jesus was not born in the year 1. We select a single event but without any value judgment. To call our age "the Common Era," even though for the Jews, the Chinese, the Tamil, the Muslims, and many others it is not a common era, constitutes the acme of colonialism.

Some critics assert that the use of identifiers which have common spellings is more ambiguous than the use of identifiers with divergent spellings. Both CE and BCE have in common the letters "CE", which is more likely to cause confusion, they claim, than identifiers with clearly different spelling.<ref name=RelTolrnc/>

===Internet reaction===
According to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' report, it was a student's use of BCE/CE notation, inspired by its use within [[Wikipedia]], which prompted the history teacher [[Andrew Schlafly]] to found [[Conservapedia]], a [[cultural conservative]] [[wiki]].<ref>

One of its "Conservapedia Commandments" is that users must always apply BC/AD notation, since its sponsors perceive BCE/CE notation to "deny the historical basis" of the dating system.<ref>[http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments Conservapedia Commandments] at Conservapedia</ref>

==Conventions in style guides==
The abbreviation BCE, just as with BC, always follows the year number. Unlike AD, which traditionally precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all).<ref name=Wilson />
Thus, the current year is written as {{CURRENTYEAR}} in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as {{CURRENTYEAR}} CE, or as AD {{CURRENTYEAR}}), and the year that [[Socrates]] died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with [[Full stop|periods]] (e.g., "<span style="font-size:87%;">BCE</span>" or "C.E.").<ref>

Style guides for academic texts on religion generally prefer BCE/CE to BC/AD.<ref>''SBL Handbook of Style'' [[Society of Biblical Literature]] 1999 "8.1.2 ERAS - The preferred style is B.C.E. and C.E. (with periods). If you use A.D. and B.C., remember that A.D. precedes the date and B.C. follows it. (For the use of these abbreviations in titles, see §7.1.3.2.)"</ref>

The terms "Common Era", "''Anno Domini''", "Before the Common Era", and "Before Christ" in contemporary English can be applied to dates that rely on either the [[Julian calendar]] or the [[Gregorian calendar]].
Modern dates are understood in the [[Western world]] to be in the Gregorian calendar, but for older dates writers should specify the calendar used. Dates in the Gregorian calendar in the Western world have always used the era designated in English as ''Anno Domini'' or ''Common Era''.

==Similar conventions in other languages==

{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Several languages other than English also have both religious and non-religious ways of identifying the era used in dates. In some [[communist state]]s during the [[Cold War]] period, usage of non-religious notation was mandated.

* In [[Angola]], the abbreviations "E.C." ("Era Comum", Common Era) and "A.E.C." ("Antes da Era Comum", Before Common Era) is generally used.
* In [[Arabic]], بعد الميلاد (After the Birth) corresponds to CE, while قبل الميلاد (Before the Birth) corresponds to BCE. The "Birth" referenced is that of Jesus. This system is in widespread use in all Arab countries, but is accompanied by the [[Hijri]] system. Dates are often given in both in that order. In Saudi Arabia, however, the Hijri System is predominant.
* In the Chinese language, common era (公元, Gong yuan) has been predominantly used to refer to the western calendar without any religious connotation. 
* In [[Finland]], the terms ''eKr.'' (''ennen Kristusta'', before Christ) and ''jKr.'' (''jälkeen Kristuksen'', after Christ) were largely used until the 1980s but have been mostly replaced during the last couple of decades with terms ''eaa.'' (''ennen ajanlaskun alkua'', before start of chronology) and ''jaa.'' (''jälkeen ajanlaskun alun'', after start of chronology).
* In [[Germany]], Enlightened Jews in [[Berlin]] seem to have already been using "(Before the) Common Era" in the 18th century, while others like [[Moses Mendelssohn]] opposed this usage as it would hinder the integration of Jews into German society.<ref name="Jewish Joke"/> The formulation seems to have persisted among German Jews in the 19th century in forms like ''vor der gewöhnlichen Zeitrechnung'' (before the common chronology).<ref>See page 175 in [http://books.google.nl/books?id=pwxFAAAAcAAJ Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums: Ein unpartheiisches Organ für alles jüdische Interesse in Betreff von Politik, Religion, Literatur, Geschichte, Sprachkunde und Belletristik, Volume 2] (Leipzig 1838).
</ref><ref>
{{aut|[[Julius Fürst]]}}, ''Geschichte des Karäerthums von 900 bis 1575 der gewöhnlichen Zeitrechnung'' (Leipzig 1862-1869).
</ref>
In 1938 [[Nazi Germany]], the use of this convention was also prescribed by the [[National Socialist Teachers League]], apparently because the Christian and Roman chronology were not "[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]" enough.<ref>See page 149 in [[Karl Ludwig Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg|Weiße Blätter]] issue [http://www.monarchieforum.org/ARCHIV/WeisseBlaetter/MAI1938.pdf May 1938]
</ref>
However, it was soon discovered that many German Jews had been using the convention ever since the 18th century, and they found it ironic to see "[[Aryan]]s following Jewish example nearly 200 years later".<ref name="Jewish Joke">
{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759195,00.html |title=GERMANY: Jewish Joke |date=7 March 1938|accessdate=2012-02-05}}
</ref>
The [[German Democratic Republic]] (1949-1990) introduced the convention of  ''v. u. Z.'' (''vor unserer Zeitrechnung'', before our chronology) and ''u. Z.'' (''unserer Zeitrechnung'', of our chronology) instead of ''v. Chr.'' (''vor Christus'', before Christ) and ''n. Chr.'' (''nach Christus/Christi Geburt'', after Christ/the Nativity of Christ). The use of these terms persists in contemporary German to some extent, differing regionally and ideologically. In Jewish contexts mostly "v. d. Z." ("vor der Zeitenwende") and "n. d. Z." ("nach der Zeitenwende") is used.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* In Hebrew, the most common term used to refer to BCE/CE is simply לספירה (according to '''the''' count) for CE, and לפני הספירה (before the count) for BCE. An alternative term, expressing an ideological (sometimes religious) approach aimed at distancing oneself from the source of the count, is למניינם (according to their count). The later is sometimes added after the former, especially in the case of BCE (e.g. שנת 150 לפני הספירה למנינם), due to technical linguistic reasons.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* In [[Hungary]], similarly to the Bulgarian case, ''i. e.'' (''időszámításunk előtt'', before our era) and ''i. sz.'' (''időszámításunk szerint'', according to our era) are still widely used instead of traditional ''Kr. e.'' (''Krisztus előtt'', Before Christ) and ''Kr. u.'' (''Krisztus után'', After Christ), which were unofficially reinstituted after the Communist period.
* In [[Indonesia]], the terms ''SM.'' (''Sebelum Masehi'', before Masehi, from Arabic word of Masih, referred to Jesus) and ''M.'' (''Masehi'', after Masehi) were generally used.
* In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], years reckoned by the Western calendar as opposed to the Japanese Imperial eras are indicated by, for example, 西暦2013年, where 西暦 (''seireki'') literally means "Western calendar" which carries no religious connotation, aside from the fact that Christianity is a Western religion. As in Korean, 紀元前 (''kigenzen'') is used to mean "before the common era (BCE)." "A.D.", and less commonly, "C.E.", are also occasionally seen, but the typical Japanese person would not know about the religious connotations or lack of in these terms.
* In [[Korean language|Korean]], 기원전(紀元前), which means "preceding the [Western] era", is used to indicate years B.C.E. 서기(西紀), "Western era", short for 서력기원(西暦紀元), meaning "[from] the origin year of the Western calendar", is used to indicate years C.E.  Christians use 주후, meaning "after [the birth of] the Lord", as a shorthand calque of Anno Domini.
* In [[Poland]] the only term generally used is ''naszej ery/przed naszą erą'' (''of our era/before our era''). The terms ''przed Chrystusem/po Chrystusie'' (''before Christ/after Christ'') are possible but nearly never used in contemporary Poland.
* In [[Romania]], throughout most of the [[Communist Romania|communist]] period, the preferred standard was to use the secularised ''î. e. n.'' (''înaintea erei noastre'', before our era) and ''e. n.'' (''era noastră'', our era). After the downfall of Communism and the 1989 [[Romanian revolution|revolution]], the original convention using ''î. Hr.'' (''înainte de Hristos'', before Christ) and ''d. Hr.'' (''după Hristos'', after Christ) has become more widespread. Alternatively, ''î. Cr.'' and ''d. Cr.'' are used, mainly due to an alternative spelling of ''Hristos'' (Christ) as ''Cristos'', the latter being preferred by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|Churches]].
* In [[Russia]], the terms ''до н.э.'' (''до нашей эры'', before our era) and ''н.э.'' (''нашей эры'', our era) are often used. Their use was nearly universal during the Soviet rule, and while their use in mass media has considerably declined and has been replaced by their Christian equivalents, the BCE/CE terms remain the strongly preferred version in scientific literature, business magazines and other "serious" texts.
* In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], EC (Era Común) is used for CE, while AEC (antes de la Era Común) is equivalent to BCE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spanish.about.com/od/writtenspanish/qt/dates.htm |title=Writing Dates in Spanish |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref>
* In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] the terms ''f.Kr.'' (''före Kristus'', before Christ) and ''e.Kr.'' (''efter Kristus'', after Christ) have traditionally been used. They are seldomly replaced by ''f.v.t.'' and ''e.v.t.'' (''före/efter vår tidräkning'', before/after our chronology).
* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], OC can be expanded to equivalents of both AD (''Oed Crist'') and CE (''Oes Cyffredin''); for dates before the Common Era, CC (traditionally, ''Cyn Crist'') is used exclusively, as ''Cyn yr Oes Cyffredin'' would abbreviate to a mild obscenity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=welsh-termau-cymraeg;982a203b.0610 |title=Welsh-Termau-Cymraeg Archives |publisher=JISCMail |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}</ref>

|quote=The influence of western culture and scholarship upon the rest of the world in turn led to this system of dating becoming the most widely used one across the globe today. Many scholars in historical and religious studies in the West in recent years have sought to lessen the explicitly Christian meaning of this system without abandoning the usefulness of a single, common, global form of dating. For this reason the terms ''common era'' and ''before the common era'', abbreviated as CE and BCE, have grown in popularity as designations. The terms are meant, in deference to non-Christians, to soften the explicit theological claims made by the older Latin terminology, while at the same time providing continuity with earlier generations of mostly western Christian historical research.

|quote=A.D. appears either before or after the number of the year... although conservative use has long preferred before only; B.C. always follows the number of the year.... Common era (C.E.) itself needs a good deal of further justification, in view of its clearly Christian numbering. Most conservatives still prefer A.D. and B.C. Best advice: don’t use B.C.E., C.E., or A.C.E. to replace B.C. and A.D. without translating the new terms for the very large number of readers who will not understand them. Note too that if we do end by casting aside the A.D./B.C. convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system itself, given its Christian basis.
