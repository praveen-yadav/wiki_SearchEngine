'''Christopher Marlowe'''<ref>"Christopher Marlowe was baptised as 'Marlow,' but he spelled his name 'Marley' in his one known surviving signature." David Kathman. [http://shakespeareauthorship.com/name1.html#3 "The Spelling and Pronunciation of Shakespeare's Name: Pronunciation."]</ref> ([[Baptism|baptised]] 26 February 1564{{spaced ndash}}30 May 1593) was an English [[dramatist]], poet and [[Translation|translator]] of the [[Elizabethan era]]. Marlowe was the foremost [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] [[tragedy|tragedian]] of his day.<ref>Robert A. Logan, ''Shakespeare's Marlowe'' (2007) p.4. "During Marlowe's lifetime, the popularity of his plays, Robert Greene's...remarks...including the designation "famous", and the many imitations of ''Tamburlaine'' suggest that he was for a brief time considered England's foremost dramatist."</ref> He greatly influenced [[William Shakespeare]], who was born in the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe's mysterious early death. Marlowe's plays are known for the use of [[blank verse]], and their overreaching [[protagonist]]s.

A warrant was issued for Marlowe's arrest on 18 May 1593. No reason was given for it, though it was thought to be connected to allegations of blasphemy—a manuscript believed to have been written by Marlowe was said to contain "vile heretical conceipts". On 20 May he was brought to the court to attend upon the [[Privy Council]] for questioning. There is no record of their having met that day, however, and he was commanded to attend upon them each day thereafter until "licensed to the contrary." Ten days later, he was stabbed to death by [[Ingram Frizer]]. Whether the stabbing was connected to his arrest has never been resolved.<ref>Nicholl, Charles (2006).

==Early life==
Marlowe was born in [[Canterbury]] to shoemaker John Marlowe and his wife Catherine.<ref>This is commemorated by the name of the town's main theatre, the [[Marlowe Theatre]], and by the town museums. However, St. George's was gutted by fire in the [[Baedeker raids]] and was demolished in the post-war period – only the tower is left, at the south end of Canterbury's High Street http://www.digiserve.com/peter/cant-sgm1.htm</ref> His date of birth is not known, but he was baptised on 26 February 1564, and is likely to have been born a few days before. Thus he was just two months older than his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]], who was baptised on 26 April 1564 in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].

Marlowe attended [[The King's School, Canterbury|The King's School]] in Canterbury (where a house is now named after him) and [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where he studied on a scholarship and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1584.<ref>{{Venn|id=MRLW580C|name=Marlowe, Christopher}}</ref> In 1587 the university hesitated to award him his Master of Arts degree because of a rumour that he intended to go to the English college at [[Rheims]], presumably to prepare for ordination as a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] priest. However, his degree was awarded on schedule when the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] intervened on his behalf, commending him for his "faithful dealing" and "good service" to [[Elizabeth I of England|the Queen]].<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/pc_cert.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 31 March 2012).</ref> The nature of Marlowe's service was not specified by the Council, but its letter to the Cambridge authorities has provoked much speculation, notably the theory that Marlowe was operating as a secret agent working for Sir [[Francis Walsingham]]'s intelligence service.<ref>He died in a deadly brawl.{{cite book | last = Hutchinson | first = Robert | title = Elizabeth's Spy Master: Francis Walsingham and the secret war that saved England| publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson | year = 2006 | location = London| page = 111 | isbn =0-297-84613-2 }}</ref> No direct evidence supports this theory, although the Council's letter is evidence that Marlowe had served the government in some secret capacity.

==Literary career==

Of the dramas attributed to Marlowe ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage]]'' is believed to have been his first, and performed by the [[Children of the Chapel]], a company of boy actors, between 1587 and 1593. The play was first published in 1594; the title page attributes the play to Marlowe and [[Thomas Nashe]].

Marlowe's first play performed on the regular stage in London, in 1587, was ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]'', about the conqueror [[Timur|Tamburlaine]], who rises from shepherd to war-lord. It is among the first English plays in blank verse,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/16century/topic_1/welcome.htm |title=See especially the middle section in which the author shows how another Cambridge graduate, Thomas Preston makes his title character express his love in a popular play written around 1560 and compares that "clumsy" line with '&#39;Doctor Faustus'&#39; addressing Helen of Troy |publisher=Wwnorton.com |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> and, with [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', generally is considered the beginning of the mature phase of the [[Elizabethan theatre]]. ''Tamburlaine'' was a success, and was followed with ''Tamburlaine the Great, Part II''.

The two parts of ''Tamburlaine'' were published in 1590; all Marlowe's other works were published posthumously. The sequence of the writing of his other four plays is unknown; all deal with controversial themes.

* ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' (first published as ''The Famous Tragedy of the Rich Jew of Malta''), about a Maltese Jew's barbarous revenge against the city authorities, has a prologue delivered by a character representing [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]. It was probably written in 1589 or 1590, and was first performed in 1592. It was a success, and remained popular for the next fifty years. The play was entered in the [[Stationers' Register]] on 17 May 1594, but the earliest surviving printed edition is from 1633.
* ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward the Second]]'' is an English history play about the deposition of King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] by his barons and the Queen, who resent the undue influence the king's favourites have in court and state affairs. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 6 July 1593, five weeks after Marlowe's death. The full title of the earliest extant edition, of 1594, is ''The troublesome reigne and lamentable death of Edward the second, King of England, with the tragicall fall of proud Mortimer.'' 
* ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' is a short and luridly written work, the only surviving text of which was probably a [[Memorial reconstruction|reconstruction from memory]] of the original performance text,<ref>{{cite book|last=Deats|first=Sarah Munson|editor=Cheney, Patrick|title=The Cambridge Companion to Christopher Marlowe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2004|page=193|chapter='Dido Queen of Carthage' and 'The Massacre at Paris'|isbn=0-521-82034-0}}</ref> portraying the events of the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in 1572, which English Protestants invoked as the blackest example of Catholic treachery. It features the silent "English Agent", whom subsequent tradition has identified with Marlowe himself and his connections to the secret service.<ref>Wilson, Richard (2004). "Tragedy, Patronage and Power". in Cheney, Patrick, 2007, p. 207</ref> ''The Massacre at Paris'' is considered his most dangerous play, as agitators in London seized on its theme to advocate the murders of refugees from the [[Spanish Netherlands|low countries]] and, indeed, it warns [[Elizabeth I]] of this possibility in its last scene.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicholl|first=Charles|title=The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London |year=1992|page=41|chapter=Libels and Heresies|isbn=0-224-03100-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hoenselaars|first=A. J.|title=Images of Englishmen and Foreigners in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, New Jersey|year=1992|pages=78–79|chapter=Englishmen abroad 1558–1603 |isbn=0-8386-3431-1}}</ref> Its full title was ''The Massacre at Paris: With the Death of the Duke of Guise''.
* ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (or ''The Tragicall History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus''), based on the German [[Faustbuch]], was the first dramatised version of the [[Faust]] legend of a scholar's dealing with the devil. While versions of "The Devil's Pact" can be traced back to the 4th century, Marlowe deviates significantly by having his hero unable to "burn his books" or repent to a merciful God in order to have his contract annulled at the end of the play. Marlowe's protagonist is instead carried off by demons, and in the 1616 quarto his mangled corpse is found by several scholars. Doctor Faustus is a textual problem for scholars as two versions of the play exist: the 1604 [[quarto]], also known as the A text, and the 1616 quarto or B text. Both were published after Marlowe's death. Scholars have disagreed which text is more representative of Marlowe's original, and some editions are based on a combination of the two. The latest scholarly consensus (as of the late 20th century) holds the A text is more representative because it contains irregular character names and idiosyncratic spelling, which are believed to reflect a text based on the author's handwritten manuscript, or "[[foul papers]]." The B text, in comparison, was highly edited, censored because of shifting theatre laws regarding religious words onstage, and contains several additional scenes which scholars believe to be the additions of other playwrights, particularly [[Samuel Rowley]] and William Bird (''alias'' Borne). 

Marlowe's plays were enormously successful, thanks in part, no doubt, to the imposing stage presence of [[Edward Alleyn]]. Alleyn was unusually tall for the time, and the haughty roles of Tamburlaine, Faustus, and Barabas were probably written especially for him. Marlowe's plays were the foundation of the repertoire of Alleyn's company, the [[Admiral's Men]], throughout the 1590s.

Marlowe also wrote the poem ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'' (published in 1598, and with a continuation by [[George Chapman]] the same year), the popular lyric "[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]", and translations of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' and the first book of [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]]'s ''[[Pharsalia]]''. In 1599, his translation of [[Ovid]] was banned and copies publicly burned as part of [[John Whitgift|Archbishop Whitgift]]'s crackdown on offensive material.

==Legend==
As with other writers of the period, little is known about Marlowe. What evidence there is can be found in legal records and other official documents. This has not stopped writers of both fiction and non-fiction from speculating about his activities and character. Marlowe has often been described as a spy, a brawler, a heretic and a homosexual, as well as a "magician", "duellist", "tobacco-user", "counterfeiter" and "[[Rake (character)|rakehell]]". J. A. Downie and Constance Kuriyama have argued against the more lurid speculation,<ref>J. A. Downie in his and J. T. Parnell's ''Constructing Christopher Marlowe'' (2000) and Constance Kuriyama in her ''Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life'' (2002).</ref> but [[J. B. Steane]] remarked, "it seems absurd to dismiss all of these Elizabethan rumours and accusations as 'the Marlowe myth{{'"}}.<ref name="steane" />

===Spying===
[[File:Edward2a.jpg|thumb|200px|Title page of the earliest published text of ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' (1594)]]
Marlowe is often alleged to have been a government spy (Park Honan's 2005 biography even had "Spy" in its title<ref>Park Honan, ''Christopher Marlowe: Poet and Spy'', 2005.</ref>) The author [[Charles Nicholl (author)|Charles Nicholl]] speculates this was the case and suggests that Marlowe's recruitment took place when he was at Cambridge. As noted above, in 1587 the Privy Council ordered the University of Cambridge to award Marlowe his degree of Master of Arts, denying rumours that he intended to go to the English Catholic college in Rheims, saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified "affaires" on "matters touching the benefit of his country".<ref>This is from a document dated 29 June 1587, from the National Archives – ''Acts of Privy Council''.</ref> Surviving college records from the period also indicate that Marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university – much longer than permitted by university regulations – that began in the academic year 1584–1585. Surviving college [[Buttery (shop)|buttery]] (provisions store) accounts indicate he began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicholl|first=Charles|title=The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London |year=1992|chapter=12|isbn=0-224-03100-7}}</ref> – more than he could have afforded on his known scholarship income.

It has sometimes been theorised that Marlowe was the "Morley" who was tutor to [[Arbella Stuart]] in 1589.<ref>He was described by Arbella's guardian, the Countess of Shrewsbury, as having hoped for an annuity of some £40 from Arbella, his being "so much damnified (i.e. having lost this much) by leaving the University.": BL [[Lansdowne MS.]] 71, f.3.and Charles Nicholl, ''The Reckoning'' (1992), pp. 340–2.</ref> This possibility was first raised in a ''TLS'' letter by E. St John Brooks in 1937; in a letter to ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', John Baker has added that only Marlowe could be Arbella's tutor due to the absence of any other known "Morley" from the period with an MA and not otherwise occupied.<ref>John Baker, letter to ''Notes and Queries'' 44.3 (1997), pp. 367–8</ref> If Marlowe was Arbella's tutor, (and some biographers think that the "Morley" in question may have been a brother of the musician [[Thomas Morley]]<ref>Constance Kuriyama, ''Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life'' (2002), p. 89. Also in Handover's biography of Arbella, and Nicholl, ''The Reckoning'', p. 342.</ref>) it might indicate that he was there as a spy, since Arbella, niece of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and cousin of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]], later James I of England, was at the time a strong candidate for the [[succession to Elizabeth's throne]].<ref>[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Elizabeth/index.html Elizabeth I and James VI and I], [http://www.history.ac.uk/ History in Focus].</ref> Frederick Boas dismisses the possibility of this identification, based on surviving legal records which document his "residence in London between September and December 1589". He had been party to a fatal quarrel involving his neighbours in [[Norton Folgate]], and was held in [[Newgate Prison]] for a fortnight.<ref>Frederick S. Boas,'' Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953), pp. 101ff.</ref> In fact the quarrel and his arrest was on 18 September, he was released on bail on 1 October, and he had to attend court – where he was cleared of any wrongdoing – on 3 December, but there is no record of where he was for the intervening two months.<ref>Constance Kuriyama, ''Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life'' (2002), p. xvi.</ref>

In 1592 Marlowe was arrested in the town of [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] in the Netherlands for his alleged involvement in the [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting]] of coins, presumably related to the activities of seditious Catholics. He was sent to be dealt with by the Lord Treasurer ([[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Burghley]]) but no charge or imprisonment resulted.<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/flushing.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 31 March 2012).</ref> This arrest may have disrupted another of Marlowe's spying missions: perhaps by giving the resulting coinage to the Catholic cause he was to infiltrate the followers of the active Catholic plotter [[William Stanley (Elizabethan)|William Stanley]] and report back to Burghley.<ref>Nicholl (1992: 246–248)</ref>

===Arrest and death===
[[Image:marlowe.jpg|thumb|right|Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of St Nicholas, [[Deptford]]. The plaque shown here is modern.]]
In early May 1593 several bills were posted about London threatening Protestant refugees from France and the Netherlands who had settled in the city. One of these, the "Dutch church libel",<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/libell.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 31 March 2012).</ref> written in [[blank verse]], contained allusions to several of Marlowe's plays and was signed, "[[Tamburlaine]]". On 11 May the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] ordered the arrest of those responsible for the libels. The next day, Marlowe's colleague [[Thomas Kyd]] was arrested. Kyd's lodgings were searched and a fragment of a [[heresy|heretical]] tract was found. Kyd asserted that it had belonged to Marlowe, with whom he had been writing "in one chamber" some two years earlier.<ref name="Peter Farey's Marlowe page">For a full transcript, see [http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/kyd2.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 31 March 2012).</ref> At that time they had both been working for an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] patron, probably [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Ferdinando Stanley]], Lord Strange.<ref>Mulryne, J. H. "Thomas Kyd." ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2004.</ref> A warrant for Marlowe's arrest was issued on 18 May, when the Privy Council apparently knew that he might be found staying with [[Thomas Walsingham (literary patron)|Thomas Walsingham]], whose father was a first cousin of the late Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], Elizabeth's [[Secretary of State (England)|principal secretary]] in the 1580s and a man more deeply involved in state espionage than any other member of the Privy Council.<ref>Haynes, Alan. ''The Elizabethan Secret Service''. London: Sutton, 2005.</ref> Marlowe duly presented himself on 20 May but, there apparently being no Privy Council meeting on that day, was instructed to "give his daily attendance on their Lordships, until he shall be licensed to the contrary".<ref>National Archives, ''Acts of the Privy Council''. Meetings of the Privy Council, including details of those attending, are recorded and minuted for 16, 23, 25, 29 and the morning of 31 May, all of them taking place in the Star Chamber at Westminster. There is no record of any meeting on either 18 or 20 May, however, just a note of the warrant being issued on 18 May and the fact that Marlowe "entered his appearance for his indemnity therein" on the 20th.</ref> On Wednesday 30 May, Marlowe was killed.

Various accounts of Marlowe's death were current over the next few years. In his ''[[Palladis Tamia]]'', published in 1598, [[Francis Meres]] says Marlowe was "stabbed to death by a bawdy serving-man, a rival of his in his lewd love" as punishment for his "epicurism and atheism."<ref>''Palladis Tamia''. London, 1598: 286v-287r.</ref> In 1917, in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Sir [[Sidney Lee]] wrote that Marlowe was killed in a drunken fight, and this is still often stated as fact today.

The official account came to light only in 1925 when the scholar [[Leslie Hotson]] discovered the [[coroner]]'s report of the inquest on Marlowe's death, held two days later on Friday 1 June 1593, by the [[Coroner of the Queen's Household]], [[William Danby (coroner)|William Danby]].<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/inquis~2.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 31 March 2012).</ref> Marlowe had spent all day in a house in [[Deptford, London|Deptford]], owned by the widow [[Eleanor Bull]], and together with three men: [[Ingram Frizer]], [[Nicholas Skeres]] and [[Robert Poley]]. All three had been employed by one or other of the Walsinghams. Skeres and Poley had helped snare the conspirators in the [[Babington plot]] and Frizer would later describe Thomas Walsingham as his "master" at that time<ref>Leslie Hotson, ''The Death of Christopher Marlowe'' (1925) p.65</ref> although his role was probably more that of a financial or business agent as he was for Walsingham's wife Audrey a few years later.<ref>Park Honan, ''Christopher Marlowe: Poet and Spy'' (2005) p.325</ref> These witnesses testified that Frizer and Marlowe had argued over the bill (now famously known as the 'Reckoning') exchanging "divers malicious words" while Frizer was sitting at a table between the other two and Marlowe was lying behind him on a couch. Marlowe snatched Frizer's dagger and wounded him on the head. In the ensuing struggle, according to the coroner's report, Marlowe was stabbed above the right eye, killing him instantly. The jury concluded that Frizer acted in self-defence, and within a month he was pardoned. Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of [http://www.deptfordchurch.org St. Nicholas, Deptford] immediately after the inquest, on 1 June 1593.

The complete text of the inquest report was published by Leslie Hotson in his book, ''The Death of Christopher Marlowe'', in the introduction to which Prof. G. L. Kittredge said "The mystery of Marlowe's death, heretofore involved in a cloud of contradictory gossip and irresponsible guess-work, is now cleared up for good and all on the authority of public records of complete authenticity and gratifying fullness", but this confidence proved fairly short-lived. 

Hotson himself had considered the possibility that the witnesses had "concocted a lying account of Marlowe's behaviour, to which they swore at the inquest, and with which they deceived the jury" but came down against that scenario.<ref>Hotson (1925) pp.39–40</ref> Others, however, began to suspect that this was indeed the case. Writing to the ''Times Literary Supplement'' shortly after the book's publication, Eugénie de Kalb disputed that the struggle and outcome as described were even possible,<ref>de Kalb, Eugénie (May 1925). "The Death of Marlowe", in ''The Times Literary Supplement''</ref> and [[Samuel A. Tannenbaum]] (a graduate of the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]]) insisted the following year that such a wound could not have possibly resulted in instant death, as had been claimed.<ref>Tannenbaum, Samuel (1926). ''The Assassination of Christopher Marlowe'', New York, pp.41–42</ref> Even Marlowe's biographer John Bakeless acknowledged that "some scholars have been inclined to question the truthfulness of the coroner's report. There is something queer about the whole episode" and said that Hotson's discovery "raises almost as many questions as it answers."<ref>Bakeless, John (1942). ''The Tragicall History of Christopher Marlowe'', p.182</ref> It has also been discovered more recently that the apparent absence of a local county coroner to accompany the Coroner of the Queen's Household would, if noticed, have made the inquest null and void.<ref>Honan (2005), p.354</ref>

One of the main reasons for doubting the truth of the inquest concerns the reliability of Marlowe's companions as witnesses.<ref>Nicholl, Charles (2004). "Marlowe, Christopher", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18079 online edn], Jan 2008, accessed 24 Aug 2013. "The authenticity of the inquest is not in doubt, but whether it tells the full truth is another matter. The nature of Marlowe's companions raises questions about their reliability as witnesses."</ref> As an ''agent provocateur'' for the late Sir Francis Walsingham, Robert Poley was a consummate liar, the "very genius of the Elizabethan underworld",<ref>Boas (1953), p.293</ref> and is even on record as saying "I will swear and forswear myself, rather than I will accuse myself to do me any harm."<ref>Nicholl (2002), p.38</ref> The other witness, Nicholas Skeres, had for many years acted as a confidence trickster, drawing young men into the clutches of people in the money-lending racket, including Marlowe's apparent killer, Ingram Frizer, with whom he was currently engaged in just such a swindle.<ref>Nicholl (2002), pp.29–30</ref> In other words, despite their being referred to as "generosi" (gentlemen) in the inquest report, they were all professional liars.

Some biographers, such as Kuriyama<ref>Kuriyama (2002), p.136</ref> and Downie,<ref>Downie, J. A. "Marlowe, facts and fictions", in Downie, J. A. & Parnell, J. T. (2000). ''Constructing Christopher Marlowe'', pp.26-27</ref> nevertheless take the inquest to be a true account of what occurred, but in trying to explain what really happened if the account was ''not'' true, others have come up with a variety of murder theories.

* Jealous of her husband Thomas's relationship with Marlowe, Audrey Walsingham arranged for the playwright to be murdered.<ref>de Kalb (1925)</ref>
* Sir Walter Raleigh arranged the murder, fearing that under torture Marlowe might incriminate him.<ref>Tannenbaum (1926)</ref>
* With Skeres the main player, the murder resulted from attempts by the Earl of Essex to use Marlowe to incriminate Sir Walter Raleigh.<ref>Nicholl (2002), p.415</ref>
* He was killed on the orders of father and son Lord Burghley and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]], who thought that his plays contained Catholic propaganda.<ref>Breight, Curtis C. (1996). '' Surveillance, Militarism and Drama in the Elizabethan Era'', p.114</ref>
* He was accidentally killed while Frizer and Skeres were pressuring him to pay back money he owed them.<ref>Hammer, Paul E. J. (1996) "A Reckoning Reframed: the 'Murder' of Christopher Marlowe Revisited", in ''English Literary Renaissance'', pp.225–242</ref>
* Marlowe was murdered at the behest of several members of the Privy Council who feared that he might reveal them to be atheists.<ref>Trow, M. J. (2001). ''Who Killed Kit Marlowe? A contract to murder in Elizabethan England'', p.250</ref>
* The Queen herself ordered his assassination because of his subversively atheistic behaviour.<ref>Riggs, David (2004). ''The World of Christopher Marlowe'', pp.334–7</ref>
* Frizer murdered him because he envied Marlowe's close relationship with his master Thomas Walsingham and feared the effect that Marlowe's behaviour might have on Walsingham's reputation.<ref>Honan (2005), p.348</ref>

There is even [[Marlovian theory of Shakespeare authorship|a theory]] that Marlowe's death was faked to save him from trial and execution for subversive atheism.<ref>Honan (2005), p.355. "Useful research has been stimulated by the infinitesimally thin possibility that Marlowe did not die when we think he did...History holds its doors open."</ref> Since there are only written documents on which to base any conclusions, however, and since it is probable that the most crucial information about his death was never committed to writing at all, it is unlikely that the full circumstances of Marlowe's death will ever be known.

Following Marlowe's arrest in 1593, Baines submitted to the authorities a "note containing the opinion of one Christopher Marly concerning his damnable judgment of religion, and scorn of God's word."<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/baines1.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 31 March 2012).</ref> Baines attributes to Marlowe a total of eighteen items which "scoff at the pretensions of the [[Old testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]"<ref name="steane">{{cite book

He also implies that Marlowe had Catholic sympathies. Other passages are merely sceptical in tone: "he persuades men to atheism, willing them not to be afraid of bugbears and hobgoblins". The final paragraph of Baines' document reads:

<blockquote>These thinges, with many other shall by good & honest witnes be aproved to be his opinions and Comon Speeches, and that this Marlowe doth not only hould them himself, but almost into every Company he Cometh he perswades men to Atheism willing them not to be afeard of bugbeares and hobgoblins, and vtterly scorning both god and his ministers as I Richard Baines will Justify & approue both by mine oth and the testimony of many honest men, and almost al men with whome he hath Conversed any time will testify the same, and as I think all men in Cristianity ought to indevor that the mouth of so dangerous a member may be stopped, he saith likewise that he hath quoted a number of Contrarieties oute of the Scripture which he hath giuen to some great men who in Convenient time shalbe named.

[[File:WPA poster Christopher Marlowe Faustus.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Poster for [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] performance of Marlowe's ''Faustus'', New York, circa 1935]]
Some critics believe that Marlowe sought to disseminate these views in his work and that he identified with his rebellious and iconoclastic protagonists.<ref>Waith, Eugene. ''The Herculean Hero in Marlowe, Chapman, Shakespeare, and Dryden''. London: Chatto and Windus, 1962. The idea is commonplace, though by no means universally accepted.</ref> However, plays had to be approved by the [[Master of the Revels]] before they could be performed, and the censorship of publications was under the control of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Presumably these authorities did not consider any of Marlowe's works to be unacceptable (apart from the ''Amores'').

===Sexuality===
Like his contemporary [[Sexuality of William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]], Marlowe is sometimes described today as homosexual. Others argue that the question of whether an Elizabethan was gay or homosexual in a modern sense is anachronistic. For the Elizabethans, what is often today termed homosexual or bisexual was more likely to be recognised as a sexual act, rather than an exclusive sexual orientation and identity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Bruce R.|title=Homosexual desire in Shakespeare's England|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=March 1995|page=74|isbn=0-226-76366-8}}</ref> Some scholars argue that the evidence is inconclusive and that the reports of Marlowe's homosexuality may simply be exaggerated rumours produced after his death. Richard Baines reported Marlowe as saying: "All they that love not Tobacco and Boys are fools". [[David Bevington]] and Eric Rasmussen describe Baines's evidence as "unreliable testimony" and make the comment: "These and other testimonials need to be discounted for their exaggeration and for their having been produced under legal circumstances we would regard as a witch-hunt".<ref>''Doctor Faustus and Other Plays'', pp. viii–ix</ref> One critic, [[J.B. Steane]], remarked that he considers there to be "no ''evidence'' for Marlowe's homosexuality at all."<ref name="steane" /> Other scholars,<ref>{{cite book |last=White|first=Paul Whitfield, ed.|title=Marlowe, History and Sexuality: New Critical Essays on Christopher Marlowe|publisher=AMS Press|location=New York|year=1998}}</ref> however, point to homosexual themes in Marlowe's writing: in ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'', Marlowe writes of the male youth Leander, "in his looks were all that men desire"<ref>''Hero and Leander'', 88 (see [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21262/21262-h/21262-h.htm Project Gutenberg]).</ref> and that when the youth swims to visit Hero at [[Sestos]], the sea god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] becomes sexually excited, "[i]magining that Ganymede, displeas'd, [h]ad left the Heavens ... [t]he lusty god embrac'd him, call'd him love ... He watched his arms and, as they opened wide [a]t every stroke, betwixt them would he slide [a]nd steal a kiss, ... And dive into the water, and there pry [u]pon his breast, his thighs, and every limb, ... [a]nd talk of love",<ref>''Hero and Leander'', 157–192.</ref> while the boy, naive and unaware of Greek love practices, protests, {{"'}}You are deceiv'd, I am no woman, I.' Thereat smil'd Neptune."<ref>''Hero and Leander'', 192–193.</ref> ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward the Second]]'' contains the following passage supporting homosexual relationships:

<blockquote><poem>
The mightiest kings have had their minions;
Great [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] loved [[Hephaestion]],
The conquering [[Hercules]] for [[Hylas]] wept;
And for [[Patroclus]], stern [[Achilles]] drooped.
And not kings only, but the wisest men:
The Roman [[Cicero|Tully]] loved [[Augustus|Octavius]],

==Reputation among contemporary writers==
Whatever the particular focus of modern critics, biographers and novelists, for his contemporaries in the literary world, Marlowe was above all an admired and influential artist. Within weeks of his death, [[George Peele]] remembered him as "Marley, the Muses' darling"; [[Michael Drayton]] noted that he "Had in him those brave translunary things / That the first poets had", and [[Ben Jonson]] wrote of "Marlowe's mighty line". [[Thomas Nashe]] wrote warmly of his friend, "poor deceased Kit Marlowe". So too did the publisher Edward Blount, in the dedication of ''Hero and Leander'' to Sir Thomas Walsingham.

Among the few contemporary dramatists to say anything negative about Marlowe was the anonymous author of the Cambridge University play ''[[Parnassus plays|The Return From Parnassus]]'' (1598) who wrote, "Pity it is that wit so ill should dwell, / Wit lent from heaven, but vices sent from hell."

The most famous tribute to Marlowe was paid by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[As You Like It]]'', where he not only quotes a line from ''[[Hero and Leander]]'' ("Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might, 'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?{{'"}}) but also gives to the clown [[Touchstone (As You Like It)|Touchstone]] the words "When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room." This appears to be a reference to Marlowe's murder which involved a fight over the "reckoning", the bill, as well as to a line in Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta''{{spaced ndash}}"Infinite riches in a little room".

Shakespeare was heavily influenced by Marlowe in his work, as can be seen in the re-using of Marlovian themes in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (''Dido'', ''Jew of Malta'', ''Edward II'' and ''Dr Faustus'' respectively). In ''[[Hamlet]]'', after meeting with the travelling actors, Hamlet requests the Player perform a speech about the Trojan War, which at 2.2.429–32 has an echo of Marlowe's ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage]]''. In ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' Shakespeare brings on a character "Marcade" (three syllables) in conscious acknowledgement of Marlowe's character "Mercury", also attending the King of Navarre, in ''Massacre at Paris''. The significance, to those of Shakespeare's audience who had read ''Hero and Leander'', was Marlowe's identification of himself with the god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].<ref name="Jean-Christophe Mayer2008">{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Wilson (scholar)|editor=Mayer, Jean-Christophe |title=Representing France and the French in early modern English drama|year=2008|publisher=University of Delaware Press|location=Newark, DE|isbn=0-87413-000-X|pages=95–97|chapter=Worthies away: the scene begins to cloud in Shakespeare's Navarre}}</ref>

==As Shakespeare==
{{Main|Marlovian theory of Shakespeare authorship|Shakespeare authorship question}}
Given the inconsistencies concerning the account of Marlowe's death, a [[Marlovian theory|theory]] has arisen centred on the notion that Marlowe may have faked his death and then continued to write under the assumed name of William Shakespeare. However, orthodox academic consensus rejects alternative candidates for authorship, including Marlowe.<ref>Kathman, David (2003), "The Question of Authorship", in Wells, Stanley; Orlin, Lena C., Shakespeare: an Oxford Guide, Oxford University Press, pp. 620–32, ISBN 978-0-19-924522-2</ref> On the other hand, in August 1819 an anonymous writer in ''The Monthly Review'' asked, "Can Christopher Marlowe be a ''nom de guerre'' assumed for a time by Shakespeare?"<ref>Boas, ''Christopher Marlowe'', p. 300.</ref>

==Memorial window in Poets' Corner==
In July 2002, a memorial window to Marlowe – a gift of the Marlowe Society<ref>[http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/christopher-marlowe Christopher Marlowe] – Westminster Abbey </ref> – was unveiled in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Controversially, a question mark was added to the generally accepted date of death.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Nigel Reynolds | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1401010/Marlowe-tribute-puts-question-mark-over-Shakespeare.html | title = Marlowe tribute puts question mark over Shakespeare | journal = The Telegraph | date = 11 Jul 2002}} </ref> On 25 October 2011 a letter from Paul Edmondson and [[Stanley Wells]] was published by ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, in which they called on the Dean and Chapter to remove the question mark on the grounds that it "flew in the face of a mass of unimpugnable evidence".<ref>{{Harvnb|Edmondson|2013|p=278.}}</ref> In 2012 they renewed this call in their e-book ''Shakespeare Bites Back'', adding that it "denies history",<ref>[http://bloggingshakespeare.com/shakespeare-bites-back-free-book ''Shakespeare Bites Back – free book''] pp. 21, 22 & 38.</ref> and again the following year in their book ''Shakespeare Beyond Doubt''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Edmondson|2013|p=234.}}</ref>
