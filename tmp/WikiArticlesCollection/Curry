'''Curry''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌr|i}}, plural '''curries''', is the generic English term primarily employed in Western culture to denote a wide variety of dishes whose origins are [[South Asian cuisine|Southern]] and [[Southeast Asian cuisine|Southeastern]] Asian cuisines, as well as [[New World]] cuisines influenced by them such as [[Trinidad and Tobago cuisine|Trinidadian]] or [[Fijian cuisine|Fijian]]. Their common feature is the incorporation of more or less complex combinations of spices and/or herbs, usually (but not invariably) including fresh or dried hot chillies.

In the original traditional cuisines, the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition, religious practice, and, to some extent, family preference. Such dishes are called by specific names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods.<ref>"No Indian, however, would have referred to his or her food as a curry. The idea of a curry is, in fact, a concept that the Europeans imposed on India's food culture. Indians referred to their different dishes by specific names ... But the British lumped all these together under the heading of curry." Collingham, Lizzie. ''Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors.'' (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, c.2006), p.115.</ref>

Traditionally, spices are used both whole and ground; cooked or raw; and they may be added at different times during the cooking process to produce different results.

[[Curry powder]], a commercially prepared mixture of spices, is largely a Western notion, dating to the 18th century. Such mixtures are commonly thought to have first been prepared by Indian merchants for sale to members of the [[British Raj|British Colonial government and army]] returning to Britain.

Dishes called "curry" may contain meat, poultry, fish, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. They may instead be entirely vegetarian, especially among those for whom there are religious proscriptions against eating meat or seafood.

Curries may be either "wet" or "dry." Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on yoghurt, coconut milk, legume purée (''[[dal]]''), or stock. Dry curries are cooked with very little liquid which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture.
<!-- The chief spices found in most [[South Asia]]n curry powders are [[turmeric]], [[coriander]], and [[cumin]]; a wide range of additional spices may be included depending on the geographic region and the foods being included (white/red meat, fish, lentils, rice and vegetables).<ref>Raghavan S. Handbook of Spices, Seasonings and flavourings. CRC Press, 2007 ISBN 0-8493-2842-X, p. 302 </ref> -->

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionary}}
Curry was adopted and anglicised from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''{{IAST|ka<u>r</u>i}}'' (கறி) meaning 'sauce',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:705.hobson |title=University of Chicago |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date=2001-09-01 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> which is usually understood to mean vegetables and/or meat cooked with spices with or without a gravy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cookeryonline.com/India/INDIA4.html#K |title=Indian Cookery Terms |publisher=Cookeryonline.com |date=2007-02-24 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> According to this theory, ''kari'' was first encountered in the mid-17th century by members of the British [[East India Company]] trading with Tamil (Indian) merchants along the [[Coromandel Coast]] of southeast India,<ref name = "SahniCur">Sahni, Julie. ''Classic Indian Cooking.'' (New York, NY: William Morrow and Company, Inc., c.1980), p.39-40.</ref> particularly at [[Fort St. George]] (later called [[Madras]] and renamed [[Chennai]] in 1996). Here, they became familiar with "a spice blend used for making kari dishes ... called ''kari podi'' or curry powder."<ref name = "SahniCur" />

==Origins and dissemination==
Dishes of highly spiced meat are thought to have originated in pre-historic times among the inhabitants of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].<ref name=lawler>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/01/indus_civilization_food_how_scientists_are_figuring_out_what_curry_was_like.single.html |title=The Mystery of Curry |work=Slate |author=Andrew Lawler |date=January 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}</ref> Archaeological evidence dating to 2600 BCE from [[Mohenjo-daro]] suggests the use of mortar and pestle to pound spices including mustard, fennel, cumin, and tamarind pods with which they flavoured food.<ref>Iyer, Raghavan. ''660 Curries.'' (New York, NY: Workman Publishing, c.2008), p.2-3.</ref> Such dishes are also recorded during the [[Vedic period|Vedic Period]] of Indian history, roughly 1700 to 500 BCE.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Spiced dishes in the Indian style were apparently carried eastward to Burma, Thailand, and China by Buddhist monks in the 7th century CE,{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} and carried southwards to Indonesia, The Philippines, and elsewhere by coastal traders at about the same time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The establishment of the [[Mughal Empire]], beginning in the early 16th century, transformed much of older Indian cuisine, especially in the north.
Another influence was the establishment of the Portuguese trading centre in [[Goa]] in 1510, resulting in the first introduction of the [[Chili pepper]] to India, as a byproduct of the [[Columbian Exchange]].

From the mid-19th century, curry has been increasingly popular in Great Britain. During the 19th century, curry was also carried to the Caribbean by Indian [[indenture]]d workers in the British sugar industry. Since the mid-20th century, curries of many national styles have become popular far from their origins, and increasingly become part of international [[fusion cuisine]].

==Curries from South Asia==
From the culinary point of view, it is useful to consider the [[Indian subcontinent]] to be the entire historical region encompassed prior to Independence and the [[Partition of India]] in August 1947; that is, the modern countries of [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]]. It is usual to distinguish broadly between "northern" and "southern" styles of Indian cuisine, recognising that within those categories are innumerable sub-styles and variations.<ref name = "CamNS">Kiple, Kenneth F. and Kriemhild Coneè Ornelas, eds. ''Cambridge World History of Food, The.'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, c.2000), vol.2, p.1149f.</ref> The distinction is commonly made with reference to the staple starch: wheat in the form of unleavened breads in the north; rice in the east; rice and millet in the south.<ref name = "CamNS" />

===Curries of India===
{{see also|Indian cuisine}}

====Curries of Goa====
Curries known as [[vindaloo]] have become well known in Great Britain, America, and elsewhere, where the name is usually used simply to indicate a fiery dish of lamb or chicken frequently including potatoes. Such dishes are far from the Goan originals.

The name "vindaloo" derives from the Portuguese ''vinha d'alhos'' or wine (''vinho'') and garlic (''alho''), the two definitive flavour ingredients. The dish was originally made with pork, not taboo to the Christian Portuguese. The inclusion of potatoes was a later Indian addition, thought to be the result of confusion with the Hindi word for potato, ''aloo''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====Curries of Karnataka====
{{Main|Cuisine of Karnataka}}
[[Image:Karnatakadishes.jpg|thumb|Curry-based dishes from [[Karnataka]], India.]]
The curries of Karnataka are typically vegetarian and with meat and fish around mostly coastal areas. They use a wide variety of vegetables and spices and coconut and jaggery are common tastes. There are dry and sauce-based curries. Some typical sauce based dishes include [[Saaru]], Gojju, Thovve, Huli, Majjige Huli; which is similar to the "kadi" made in the north, Sagu or Kootu, which is eaten mixed with hot rice.

====Curries of Kerala====
{{Main|Cuisine of Kerala}}

[[Malayali]] curries of [[Kerala]] typically contain shredded [[coconut]] paste or [[coconut milk]], [[Curry tree|curry leaves]], and various spices. Mustard seeds are used in almost every dish, along with onions, curry leaves, sliced red chilies fried in hot oil. Most of the non-vegetarian dishes are heavily spiced. Kerala is known for its traditional [[sadya]], a vegetarian meal served with boiled rice and a host of side-dishes, such as [[parippu]] (green gram), [[papadum]], some [[ghee]], [[Sambar (dish)|sambar]], [[rasam]], [[aviyal]], [[kaalan]], [[kichadi]], [[pachadi]], [[injipuli]], [[loottukari]], [[Indian pickle|pickles]] (mango, lime), [[thoran]], one to four types of [[payasam]], [[Boli (food)|boli]], [[Olan (dish)|olan]], pulissery, moru ([[buttermilk]]), upperi, [[banana]] chips, etc. The sadya is customarily served on a banana leaf.

====Curries of Tamil Nadu====
{{Main|South Indian cuisine}}

[[Tamil cuisine]]'s distinctive flavour and aroma is achieved by a blend and combination of [[spice]]s including [[Curry tree|curry leaves]], [[tamarind]], [[coriander]], [[ginger]], [[garlic]], [[chili pepper|chili]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[poppy seed]]s, [[mustard seed]]s, [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, [[cardamom]], [[cumin]], [[fennel]] or [[anise]] seeds, [[fenugreek seed]]s, [[nutmeg]], [[coconut]], [[turmeric]] root or powder, and [[rosewater]]. [[Lentil]]s, [[vegetable]]s and [[dairy product]]s are essential accompaniments and are often served with rice. Traditionally vegetarian foods dominate the menu with a range of non-vegetarian dishes including [[freshwater]] [[Fish (food)|fish]] and [[seafood]] cooked with spices and seasoning.

===Bengali, Bangladeshi and Oriya curries===
{{Main|Bangladeshi cuisine|Bengali cuisine|Oriya cuisine}}

[[Image:Beef Curry in Bangladesh.jpg|right|thumb|Curry served with roasted onion in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]]]
[[Oriya cuisine]] includes curries, including seafood and fresh fish. Mustard seeds and mustard oil are added to many recipes, as are poppy seeds.

The [[Bengali people]] have similar eating habits and also prepare these types of curries.

===Curries of Maharashtra===
{{Main|Maharashtrian cuisine}}

The curries of [[Maharashtra]] vary from mildly spicy to very spicy and include vegetarian, mutton, chicken and fish. Coastal Maharashtrian – Konkani – curries use coconut extensively along with spices. In western Maharashtra, curries are very spicy and [[Peanut|groundnut]] (peanut) powder is often added to it. Vidarbha's cuisine is usually spicier than that of the coastal and southern regions. The ingredients commonly used are besan, or [[chickpea]] flour, and groundnut powder. As a result of the long Islamic Moghul rule in the region, the cuisine of Aurangabad has been highly influenced by the North Indian method of cooking. Khandeshi food is very spicy and the most famous dish is Shev bhaji.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}. Others include [[eggplant|brinjal]] wange, che bharit, Udidachi dal, Bharleli wangi, [[thecha]] bhakari, and spicy mutton. Most of the people are farmers so their traditional food is very simple.

===Curries of Gujarat===
{{Main|Gujarati cuisine}}
Although "wet curries" play a smaller role in Gujarat than elsewhere, there are a number of vegetarian examples with gravies based on buttermilk or coconut milk. The main ingredient may variously be brinjal (eggplant or aubergine), potatoes, fresh corn kernels, okra, tomatoes, etc. In addition, there are several common [[kofta]] dishes which, of course, substitute vegetables for meat.<ref>Reejhsinghani, Aroona. ''Vegetarian Wonders from Gujarat.'' (Mumbai: Jaico Publishing House, c.2002), p.123-128.</ref> [[Undhiyu]], a Gujarati specialty, is a spicy "wet" mixed-vegetable "casserole" cooked in an earthenware pot, often eaten during the winter months.
<!-- Curry varies in flavour and heat. Mild curry could be made of [[cardamom]], [[coriander]], [[cumin]], [[turmeric]], [[star anise]], and salt.-->

===Curries of Kashmir===
[[Image:Rogan josh02.jpg|thumb|Kashmiri [[rogan josh]]]]
In the West, the best-known curry is ''[[rogan josh]],'' a wet curry of lamb with a brilliant red gravy whose colour is derived from a combination of Kashmiri chillis (''kashmiri mirchi'') and an extract derived from the red flowers of the cockscomb plant (''mawal'').<ref>"Rogan Josh," in Khan Mohammed Sharief Waza, Khan Mohammed Shafi Waza, and Khan Mohammed Rafiq Waza. ''Wazwaan: Traditional Kashmiri Cuisine.'' (New Delhi: Roli & Janssen BV, c.2007), p.34.</ref> ''Goshtaba,'' (large lamb meatballs cooked in yogurt gravy) is another curry dish from the Wazwan tradition occasionally found in Western restaurants.<ref>"Ghushtaba" in Khan Mohammed Sharief Waza, Khan Mohammed Shafi Waza, and Khan Mohammed Rafiq Waza. ''Wazwaan: Traditional Kashmiri Cuisine.'' (New Delhi: Roli & Janssen BV, c.2007), p.37.</ref>
<!--''[[Kadhi]]'' is a specific dish, made by stirring [[yogurt]] into a [[roux]] of [[ghee]] and [[Gram flour|besan]]. The spices added vary, but usually include [[turmeric]], [[black mustard]] seed, and [[Curry tree|curry leaves]]. It is often eaten with rice. [[North India]], where dishes are classified as ''sukhi'' (dry) and ''tari'' (with liquid), the word ''curry'' is often confounded with the similar-sounding [[Hindi-Urdu]] word ''tari'' (from the [[Persian language|Persian]]-derived ''tar'' meaning ''wet'') and has no implications for the presence or absence of spice, or whether the dish is Indian or not (e.g. any stew, spicy or not, would be considered a curry dish, simply because it is wet).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Fk8FQa2ZSFQC |title=India| author=Sarina Singh |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2010-05-17|quote=generally cooked sukhi (dry) or tari (in a sauce) | isbn=978-1-74059-694-7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E2saAQAAIAAJ|title=Hanklyn-janklin: a stranger's rumble-tumble guide to some words, customs, and quiddities, Indian and Indo-British| author=Nigel B.

===Pakistani cuisine===
{{Main|Pakistani cuisine}}
[[File:Chicken Curry 1.JPG|thumb|[[Curry chicken]] from Pakistan]]
Unlike the wet curries of the neighbouring India, Pakistani curries are mostly dry and vary greatly in spice depending on the locality. Meat, including beef, is often an ingredient. A typical Pakistani lunch or dinner often consists of some form of bread (such as naan, or roti) or rice with a meat or vegetable-based curry. Barbecue style or roasted meats are also very popular in the form of kebabs.

It is worth noting that the term "curry" is virtually never used inside the country, instead regional words such as ''salan'' are used to denote what is known outside the country as a "curry". In addition, curry powder is almost never used in a Pakistani curry.

Several different types of curries exist, depending on the cooking style, such as bhuna, bharta, roghan josh, qorma, qeema, and shorba. A favourite [[Pakistan]]i curry is [[karahi]], which is either mutton or chicken cooked in a cooking utensil called karahi, which is similar in shape to a wok. Lahori karahi incorporates garlic, ginger, fresh chillies, tomatoes and select spices. Peshawari karahi is another very popular version made with just meat, salt, tomatoes, and coriander.

====Curries of Punjab====
{{Main|Punjabi cuisine}}
[[Image:Riceandcereal.JPG|thumb|Curried [[Common bean#Red or kidney beans|rajmah]] with rice.]]
[[Punjab region|Punjab]] is a rich agricultural land, where fresh vegetables and fruits have always been accessible. A typical Punjabi meal consists of some form of bread or rice with a ''salan'' (curry). Most preparations start with the frying of a [[spice mix|masala]] which is a concoction of ginger, garlic, onions and tomatoes with some dried spices. This is followed by the addition of other ingredients. Spice level varies greatly depending on the sub-region as well as the household itself. A popular cooking fat is pure [[desi]] [[ghee]], and some dishes are often enriched with liberal amounts of [[butter]] and [[cream]]. There are certain dishes that are exclusive to Punjab, such as maash di dal and saron da saag (sarson ka saag).

====Curries of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa====
{{Main|Afghan cuisine|Pashtun cuisine}}
The cuisine from the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]] is somewhat similar to the cuisine of neighbouring Afghanistan. Extreme winters in some areas made the supply of fresh vegetables impossible, therefore a lot of dried fruits and vegetables are incorporated in the cuisine. The province still produces a large amount of nuts which are used abundantly in traditional cooking, along with cereals like wheat, maize, barley, and rice. Accompanying these staples are dairy products (yoghurt, whey), various nuts, native vegetables, and fresh and dried fruits. Peshawari karahi from the provincial capital of [[Peshawar]] is a popular curry all over the country.

====Curries of Sindh====
{{Main|Sindhi cuisine}}
In Pakistan, the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan border the [[Arabian Sea]]. Due to this, the Sindhi cuisine often has abundant use of fish in curries. Among Pakistani food, the Sindhi curries generally tend to be the hottest. The daily food in most Sindhi households consists of [[wheat]]-based flatbread ([[phulka]]) and rice accompanied by two dishes, one [[gravy]] and one dry.
[[File:Kaleji Curry.JPG|thumb|A "Kaleji" (liver) meat curry cooked in Pakistani style]]

====Curries from Balochistan====
Most of the Balochistan province is covered by the [[Cholistan]] desert. This means harsh summers and winters, and a lot of dried fruits and nuts have been incorporated in traditional cooking. On the other hand, in areas bordering the [[Arabian Sea]], fish is often used in curries or roasts. [[Sajji]] which is essentially a spice-rubbed lamb roasted on open fire is a provincial specialty famous across the country in many forms.

===Curries of Sri Lanka===
{{see also|Sri Lankan cuisine}}
In [[Sri Lanka]]n cuisine, [[rice]], which is usually consumed daily, can be found at any special occasion; whilst spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. "[[Rice and curry]]" refers to a range of Sri Lankan dishes.

===Northeast Indian and Nepalese cuisines===
{{Main|Nepalese cuisine|Assamese cuisine|Naga cuisine|Sikkimese cuisine|Tripuri cuisine}}

The curries of [[Northeast India]] are very different from those of other parts of India. This area's cuisine has been influenced by its neighbours, namely [[Cuisine of Burma|Burma]] and [[Tibetan cuisine|Tibet]]. Well known Indian spices are used less. [[Yak]] is a popular meat in this region of India.

[[Daal bhaat]] (rice and [[lentil soup]]) is a staple dish of [[Nepal]]. [[Newa cuisine]] is a type of cuisine developed over centuries by the [[Newar]]s of Nepal.

==Other Asian cuisines==

===Curries of China===
{{See also|Chinese cuisine}}
Chinese curries (咖哩, gā lǐ) typically consist of chicken, beef, fish, lamb, or other meats, green peppers, onions, large chunks of potatoes, and a variety of other ingredients and spices in a mildly spicy yellow curry sauce, and topped over [[steamed rice]]. White pepper, soy sauce, hot sauce, and/or hot chili oil may be applied to the sauce to enhance the flavour of the curry.

The most common Chinese variety of curry sauce is usually sold in powder form. It seems to have descended from a Singaporean and Malaysian variety, countries which also introduced the [[satay]] sauce to the Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The ethnic Cantonese (dominant in [[Kuala Lumpur]]), this yellow, [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese-Malaysian]] variety was naturally introduced to China by the Cantonese, and features typically in Hong Kong cuisine, where curry is often cooked with [[brisket]] or [[fish balls]]. Malay satay seems to have been introduced to China with wider success by the ethnic [[Teochew people|Teochew]], who make up the second largest group of Chinese of [[Chinese Singaporean|Singapore]] and are the dominant group in [[Thai Chinese|Thailand]].

There are many different varieties of Chinese curry, depending on each restaurant. Unlike other Asian curries, which usually have a thicker consistency, Chinese curry is often watery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} "Galimian," (from Malaysian "curry mee" or "curry noodles,") is also a popular Chinese curry dish.

===Curries of Japan===
[[File:Curry rice by Hyougushi in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Japanese style ''Karē-Raisu'' (Curry rice)]]
[[File:Curry-bun,curry-pan,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|''Karē-Pan'' (Curry bread)]]
{{Main|Japanese curry}}
{{Nihongo|Japanese curry|カレー|karē}} is one of the most popular dishes in [[Japan]], where people eat it an average of 78 times a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbcurry.com/qa/number_1.html|title=Curry Q&A|author=S&B Foods Inc|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-04-11}}</ref> It is usually eaten as ''karē raisu'' — curry, rice and often pickled vegetables, served on the same plate and eaten with a spoon, a common lunchtime canteen dish. It is less spicy and seasoned than Indian and Southeast Asian curries, being more of thick Japanese stew than a curry.

British people brought curry from the [[British Raj|Indian colony]] back to Britain<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sb-worldwide.com/curry/history.html|title=History of Japanese curry|author=S&B Company}}</ref> and introduced it to Japan during the [[Meiji period]], after Japan ended its policy of national self-isolation ([[Sakoku]]), and curry in Japan was categorised as a [[Yōshoku|Western dish]]. Its spread across the country is commonly attributed to its use in the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] which adopted it extensively as convenient field and naval canteen cooking, allowing even conscripts from the remotest countryside to experience the dish. The [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] traditionally have curry every Friday for lunch and many ships have their own unique recipes.

The standard Japanese curry contains [[onion]]s, [[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, and sometimes [[celery]], and a meat that is cooked in a large pot. Sometimes grated [[apple]]s or [[honey]] are added for additional sweetness and other vegetables are sometimes used instead. For the meat, [[pork]], [[beef]] and [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] are the most popular, in order of decreasing popularity. In northern and eastern Japan including [[Tokyo]], pork is the most popular meat for curry. Beef is more common in western Japan, including [[Osaka]], and in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] chicken is favoured.<ref>[http://curryken.fc2web.com/minzoku/minzoku.htm The Curry Rice Research] (in Japanese)</ref> Curry seasoning is commonly sold in the form of a condensed brick which dissolves in the mixture of meat and vegetables.

Sometimes the curry-rice is topped with breaded pork cutlet ([[tonkatsu]]); this is called ''Katsu-karē'' ("cutlet curry"). [[Korokke]] (potato croquettes) are also a common topping.

Apart from with rice, ''karē [[udon]]'', ''karē [[ramen]]'' (thick [[noodle]]s in curry flavoured soup) and ''[[curry bread|karē-pan]]'' ("[[curry bread]]" — deep-fried battered [[bread]] with curry in the middle) are also popular.

Curry was introduced to Korea by the Japanese during their occupation in the early 20th century, and is hence nearly identical to the Japanese version. The common ingredients are rice, curry sauce, vegetables, kimchi, smoked pork, and wasabi.

===Southeast Asian cuisines===
{{See also|Cambodian cuisine|Lao cuisine|Singaporean cuisine}}

[[Southeast Asia]]n countries, including [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and [[Thailand]] have their own versions of curry.

====Burmese cuisine====
{{See also|Burmese cuisine}}
Burmese cuisine is based on a very different understanding of curries. The principal ingredients of almost all Burmese curries are fresh onion (which provides the gravy and main body of the curry), Indian spices and red chilies. Usually, meat and fish are the main ingredients for popular curries.

Burmese curries can be generalised into two types – the hot spicy dishes which exhibit north Indian or Pakistani influence, and the milder "sweet" curries. Burmese curries almost overwhelmingly lack coconut milk, setting them apart from most southeast Asian curries.

Regular ingredients include fresh onion, garlic and [[chili paste (disambiguation)|chili paste]]. Common spices include [[garam masala]], dried chili powder, [[cumin]] powder, turmeric and [[Cuisine of Burma#Ngapi|ngapi]], a fermented paste made from either fish or prawns. Burmese curries are quite oily, as the extra oil helps the food to last longer. A spaghetti equivalent called [[Nan gyi thohk]] exists, in which wheat or rice noodles are eaten with thick chicken curry.

====Indonesian cuisine====
[[File:Roti Cane Kari Kambing.jpg|thumb|''Kari kambing'' (mutton curry) served with ''[[roti canai]]'' in [[Sumatra]].]]
{{See also|Indonesian cuisine}}
In [[Indonesia]] curry is called ''kari'' or ''kare''. The most common type of ''kari'' consumed in Indonesia is ''kari ayam'' (chicken curry) and ''kari kambing'' (goat meat curry). In [[Aceh]] and [[North Sumatra]] [[Roti Canai|roti cane]] is often eaten with ''kari kambing''. Other dishes such as [[gulai]] and [[Opor ayam|opor]] are dishes based on curry. They are often highly localised and reflect the meat and vegetables available. They can therefore employ a variety of meats (chicken, beef, water buffalo and goat as in the flavoursome ''gulai kambing''), seafood (prawn, crab, mussel, clam, squid, etc.), fish (tuna, mackerel, carp, pangasius, catfish), or vegetables (young [[jackfruit]], common beans, [[cassava]] leaf) dishes in a spiced sauce. They use local ingredients such as [[chili pepper]]s, [[kaffir lime]] leaves, [[lemongrass]], [[galangal]], [[Bay leaf#Taxonomy|Indonesian bay leaves]] (salam leaf), [[candlenut]]s, [[turmeric]], turmeric leaves, [[Garcinia atroviridis|asam gelugur]] and [[Garcinia#Selected species|asam kandis]] (sour [[Garcinia|mangosteens]] similar to [[tamarind]]), [[terasi|shrimp paste]] (terasi), [[cumin]], [[coriander]] seed and [[coconut milk]]. In Aceh, curries use ''daun salam koja'' or ''daun kari'' (''[[Murraya koenigii]]'') translated as "curry leaves". 

One dish is [[rendang]] from [[Minangkabau cuisine|West Sumatran cuisine]]. Rendang is usually not considered in Indonesia to be curry since it is richer and contains less liquid than is normal for Indonesian curries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Authentic rendang uses water buffalo slow-cooked in thick coconut milk for a number of hours to tenderise, caramelise, and flavour the meat. [[Opor Ayam]] is another variation of curry, which tastes very similar to that of gulai. Opor is usually whitish in colour and does not use cinnamon nor [[turmeric]], while gulai does. Opor is also often part of a family meal around [[Eid ul-Fitr|Lebaran]], while gulai can be commonly found in [[Padang food|Padang restaurants]].

====Malaysian cuisine====
{{See also|Malaysian cuisine}}
Being at the crossroads of ancient trade routes has left a mark on the Malaysian cuisine. While the curry may have initially found its way to Malaysian shores via the Indian population, it has since become a staple among the Malays and Chinese too. Malaysian curries differ from state to state, even within similar ethnic groupings, as they are influenced by the many factors, be it cultural, religious, agricultural or economical.

Malaysian curries typically use curry powders rich in turmeric, coconut milk, shallots, ginger, [[belacan]] (shrimp paste), chili peppers, and garlic. Tamarind is also often used. [[Rendang]] is another form of curry consumed in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia; although it is drier and contains mostly meat and more coconut milk than a conventional Malaysian curry. Rendang was mentioned in Malay literature [[Hikayat Amir Hamzah]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rahQDaE0bD8C&pg=PA10&dq=rendang+hikayat |title=Hikayat Amir Hamzah |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08 | isbn=978-983-192-116-6}}</ref> (1550s)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcp.anu.edu.au/N/AHmz_bib.html |title=malay concordance project |publisher=Mcp.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> is popular among Indonesians, Singaporeans and Malaysians. All sorts of things are curried in Malaysia, including mutton, chicken, shrimp, cuttlefish, fish, aubergines, eggs, and vegetables.

====Maldivian cuisine====
{{See also|Maldivian cuisine}}

The most important curry in the cuisine of the [[Maldives]] is cooked with diced fresh [[tuna]] and is known as ''[[mas riha]]''. ''Kukulhu riha'', [[chicken curry]], is cooked with a different mixture of spices.

Traditional vegetable curries in the Maldives include those that use ''bashi ([[eggplant]]), tora ([[Luffa aegyptiaca]]), barabō ([[pumpkin]]), chichanda ([[Trichosanthes cucumerina]])'' and ''muranga ([[Moringa oleifera]]''), as well as green unripe [[banana]]s and certain leaves as their main ingredients. Pieces of [[Maldive fish]] are normally added to give the vegetable curry a certain flavour.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom'', Barcelona 1999, ISBN 84-7254-801-5</ref>

====Philippine cuisine====
[[File:Chickenjf22.JPG|thumb|Chicken curry (La Familia, Baliuag, Bulacan, Philippines)]]
{{See also|Philippine cuisine}}
In the Philippines, two kinds of curry traditions are seen corresponding with the cultural divide between the Westernized north and Islamized south. In the northern areas, a linear range of curry recipes could be seen. Chicken cooked in coconut milk, chillies and curry powder is the usual curry dish that northern Filipinos are familiar with. A typical northern Filipino curry dish would be usually of either pork or chicken as the meat while cooked at a similar manner as to other local dishes such as ''[[adobo]]'', ''[[kaldereta]]'', and ''[[mechado]]'', ''patis'' ([[fish sauce]]), with potatoes, bay leaf, coconut milk, and sometimes lemongrass and carrots to complement.

In southern areas of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago and southern Palawan, various curries are seen, and owe their origins to their non-colonized histories and thus centuries of continued contact with Indonesia, the Malay Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent. These Mindanaoan curries include ''Kulma'', synonymous with [[Korma]], ''Tiyula Itum'' which is a beef curry blackened with burned coconut-meat powder, and [[Rendang]], also eaten in Indonesia and Malaysia. Meats used in these curries include beef, lamb and chicken. Pork is not used in accordance with Islamic dietary laws.

====Curries of Thailand====
{{See also|Thai curry}}
In Thai cuisine, curries are called ''kaeng'', and usually consist of meat, fish and/or vegetables in a sauce based on a paste made from chilies, onions or shallots, garlic, and [[shrimp paste]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thaicooking.nationmultimedia.com/?p=1382 |title=Thai cooking,food thai,Thai menu, pad thai recipe |publisher=Thaicooking.nationmultimedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}</ref> Additional spices and herbs define the type of curry. Local ingredients, such as chili peppers, [[kaffir lime]] leaves, [[lemon grass]], [[galangal]] and, in central and southern Thai cuisine, also coconut milk are used. Northern and northeastern Thai curries generally do not contain coconut milk. Due to the use of fresh herbs, spices, and other fresh ingredients, Thai curries tend to be more aromatic than Indian curries. In the West, some of the Thai curries are described by colour; [[red curry|red curries]] use red chilies while [[green curry|green curries]] use green chilies. [[Yellow curry]] - called ''Kaeng kari'' (by various spellings) in [[Thai language|Thai]], of which a literal translation could be "curry soup" - is more similar to Indian curries, with the use of [[turmeric]], [[cumin]], and other dried spices. A few stir-fried Thai dishes also use an Indian style curry powder (Thai: ''pong kari'').

Thai curries:
* [[Yellow curry]]
* [[Massaman curry]]
* [[Green curry]]
* [[Red curry]]
* [[Phanaeng curry]]
* [[Khao soi]]
* Kaeng hangle
* [[Kaeng som]]

====Vietnamese cuisine====
{{See also|Vietnamese cuisine}}

In [[Vietnam]], curry is called ''cà ri''. Vietnamese curry features coconut milk, potato, sweet potato, taro roots, chicken garnished with cilantro and green onion and is more soup-like than Indian curry. Goat curry also exists but only at a few specialised restaurants. The curry is usually eaten with a baguette, rice vermicelli or steamed rice. Vietnamese curry is considered a Southern food.

==South African curries and curries of other countries==
Other countries have their own varieties of curry, well known examples include:

* [[South African cuisine|'''South Africa''']]: African Curries, Cape Malay Curries and Natal Curries including the Traditional Natal Curry, the Durban Curry, the Bunni Chow ([[Bunny Chow]]) and Roti Rolls. The history of South African, especially Natal Curries, go as far back as 250 years ago when the first Indians arrived on the shores of the Natal Colony, well before the boom of British Curries.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Durban has the largest single population of Indians outside of India and as a result have been developing traditional Natal Curries ever since. Natal Curries are mostly based on South Indian dishes and mostly consist of simple spiced lamb and chicken dishes (with large amounts of [[Ghee]] and oils) to very complex and elaborate seafood, ckicken and lambs specialities (the chicken and prawn curry is a Natal favourite). European recipes have also evolved alongside [[Indian South African]] curries. European versions use mainly traditional recipes with the addition of red wine, milk, cream, vanilla or butter instead of Ghee. The famous [[Bunny Chow]], a South African standard, has spread in popularity throughout the country, into other southern African countries and countries with large South African populations. It consists of either a lamb, chicken or bean curry poured into a tunnelled out loaf of bread to be eaten with one's fingers. The Roti Roll is another classic take-away curry that could either be a curry in a very flat roti bread (similar to a kebab bread) or the classic "Chip, Cheese and Curry" roll which basically consists of fried chips with melted cheese and the gravy of your favourite curry rolled into a roti roll.

* [[Caribbean cuisine|Caribbean]]: [[Curry goat]]
* [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]], and [[Tonga]]: Known generally as "kare" or "kale," the spice is a popular ingredient in curried lamb, mutton, and chicken stew. Often prepared with coconut milk and accompanied by rice or taro.
* [[Ethiopian cuisine|Ethiopia]]: [[Wat (food)|Wat]], a thick, heavily spiced stew.
* [[German cuisine|Germany]]: [[Currywurst]].
* [[African cuisine|Central Africa]]: Groundnut stew, though not technically a curry, is a similar style
* [[Central Europe]]: [[Goulash]] is a spicy stew or soup usually made with paprika, garlic, potatoes, beef or pork and dill. Not served with rice.

* [[Mexico]]: Mole, which also originally meant sauce, features different regional variations and combinations of chilies, spices, and chocolate.

[[Curry powder]] is used as an incidental ingredient in other cuisines, including for example a "curry sauce" (''sauce au curry'', sometimes even ''au cari'') variation of the classic French [[béchamel]].

==Curry in Great Britain==
{{See also|Anglo-Indian cuisine}}

===Historical development===
Historically, the word "curry" was first used in [[British cuisine]] to denote dishes of meat (often leftover lamb) in a Western-style sauce flavoured with [[curry powder]].

The first curry recipe in Britain appeared in ''[[Art of Cookery|The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy]]'' by [[Hannah Glasse]] in 1747.<ref>{{Cite book| title= The art of cookery, made plain and easy | author=Hannah Glasse | id=OCLC 4942063 | year = 1747}}</ref> The first edition of her book used only black pepper and coriander seeds for seasoning of "currey". By the fourth edition of the book, other ingredients such as turmeric and ginger were called for. The use of hot spices was not mentioned, which reflected the limited use of chili in India — [[chili pepper|chili plants]] had only been introduced into India around the late 15th century and at that time were only popular in southern India.

Many curry recipes are contained in 19th century cookbooks such as those of [[Charles Elmé Francatelli]] and [[Mrs Beeton]]. In ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'', a recipe for curry powder is given that contains coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cayenne, mustard, ginger, allspice and fenugreek; although she notes that it is more economical to purchase the powder at "any respectable shop".<ref>{{Cite book| title= Mrs. Beeton's book of household management | author=Isabella Mary Beeton | page=215 | isbn=0-304-35726-X | year = 1861}}</ref>

<!--However, the use of fresh spices such as ginger and [[garlic]], and preparation of an initial masala from freshly ground dried spices are sometimes used.-->
According to legend, one 19th century attempt at curry resulted in the invention of [[Worcestershire sauce]].<ref>{{Cite book| title= Curry: A tale of cooks and conquerors | author=Lizzie Collingham | isbn=0-09-943786-4 | year = 2006 | publisher = Vintage | chapter = Curry Powder| pages=149–150 }}</ref>

Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, curry grew increasingly popular in Britain owing to the large number of British civil servants and military personnel associated with the [[British Raj]]. Following World War II, curry became even more popular in Britain owing to the large number of immigrants from South Asia.

Curry has become an integral part of British cuisine, so much so that, since the late 1990s, [[chicken tikka masala]] has been referred to as "a true British national dish".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,,657407,00.html|title=Robin Cook's chicken tikka masala speech|accessdate=2006-12-12 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2001-04-19}}</ref> It is now available on [[InterCity (British Rail)|Intercity]] rail trains, as a flavour for crisps (US: potato chips), and even as a pizza topping.

Other British curry derivatives include "[[Coronation chicken]]", a cold dish invented to commemorate the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953 – and '''curry sauce''' (or '''curry gravy'''), usually served warm with traditional British fast food dishes such as [[French fried potatoes|chips]]. Curry sauce occasionally includes [[Sultana (grape)|sultana]]s.

====British curry house====
In 1810, the [[British Bangladeshi|British Bengali]] entrepreneur [[Sake Dean Mahomed]] opened the first Indian curry house in England: the [[Hindoostanee Coffee House]] in London.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Curry house founder is honoured|date=29 September 2005|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4290124.stm|accessdate=2008-10-09 | location=London}}</ref> (Curry was served prior to this in some London [[Coffee House|coffee houses]].) <ref>{{cite web|last=Jahangir |first=Rumeana |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8370054.stm |title=How Britain got the hots for curry |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}</ref>
<!-- Curry is eaten in almost all parts of the Indian subcontinent and outside, namely India, Bangladesh and [[Pakistan]], it has its varying degrees of style, taste and aroma, depending on local ingredients used. -->

The first modern "upscale" Indian restaurant in Britain is thought to have been [[Veeraswamy]] in London's Regent Street, founded in 1926.<ref>Basu, Shrabani. ''Curry: The Story of the Nation's Favourite Dish.'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Sutton Publishing, c.2003), p.127.</ref>

Bengalis in the U.K. settled in big cities with industrial employment. In London, they settled in the East End. For centuries, the East End has been the first port of call for many immigrants working in the docks and shipping from east Bengal. Their regular stopover paved the way for food and curry outlets to be opened up catering for an all-male workforce as family migration and settlement took place some decades later. [[Brick Lane]] in the East [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] is famous for its many curry houses.

Until the early 1970s, more than three-quarters of Indian restaurants in Britain were identified as being owned and run by people of Bengali origin. Most were run by migrants from East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh in 1971. Bangladeshi restaurateurs overwhelmingly come from the northeastern division of [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]]. Until 1998, as many as 85% of curry restaurants in the UK were [[British Bangladeshi]] restaurants,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curryhouse.co.uk/scene/ethnshow.htm|title=UK Curry Scene|accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> but in 2003 this figure declined to just over 65%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/177_food/page5.shtml|title=Indian Curry in London|accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> Currently, the dominance of Bangladeshi restaurants is generally declining in some parts of London and the further north one travels. In Glasgow, there are more restaurants of Punjabi origin than any other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.menumagazine.co.uk/book/restauranthistory.html|title=The history of the "ethnic" restaurant in Britain|accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref>

Regardless of the ethnic origin of a restaurant's ownership, the menu will often be influenced by the wider [[Indian subcontinent]] (sometimes including [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese dishes]]), and sometimes cuisines from further afield (such as [[Cuisine of Iran|Persian dishes]]). Some British variations on Indian food are now being exported from the U.K. to India.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8635456.stm|title=Can the British curry take off in India?|accessdate=2010-04-23 | work=BBC News | date=2010-04-21}}</ref> British-style curry restaurants are also popular in [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

This cuisine is characterised by the use of a common base for all the sauces to which spices are added when individual dishes are prepared. The standard "feedstock" is usually a sautéed mixture of onion, garlic and fresh ginger, to which various spices are added, depending on the recipe, but which may include: cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, chilies, peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds. Ground [[coriander]] seed is widely used as a thickening agent, and [[turmeric]] is added for colour and its digestive qualities. Fresh or canned tomatoes and bell peppers are a common addition.

Better quality restaurants will normally make up new sauces on a daily basis, using fresh ingredients wherever possible and grinding their own spices. More modest establishments are more likely to resort to frozen or dried ingredients and pre-packaged spice mixtures.

====British curry-house terminology====
Restaurants in Great Britain, America, and elsewhere have adopted a number of Indian terms to identify popular dishes. Although the names may derive from traditional dishes, often the recipes do not. Representative names include:

* Bhuna – medium, thick sauce, some vegetables (''bhunna'' in Urdu means "to be fried).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bhuna |title=Bhuna &#124; Define Bhuna at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}</ref>
* [[Biryani]] – spiced rice and meat cooked together and usually served with vegetable curry sauce.
* Curry – the most common name for a meat dish (most often chicken or lamb) with a medium-spicy, brown, gravy-like sauce.
* [[Dhansak]] – in the curry house, it may be made with either lamb or chicken and frequently contains pineapple, though this is not original.<ref>Chapman, Pat. ''Favourite Restaurant Curries.'' (The Curry Club). (London: Piatkus, c.1988), p.96.</ref> The name derives from a Parsi dish of mutton cooked with lentils (''dal'') and vegetables.
* [[Dupiaza]]/dopiaza – medium curry (the word means "double onion", referring to the boiled and fried onions used as its primary ingredient).
* [[Jalfrezi]] – onion, green chili and a thick sauce.
* [[Kofta]] – refers to dishes containing meatballs (most frequently lamb), or vegetable substitutes (most often ground nuts).
* [[Korma]]/kurma – mild, yellow in colour, with almond and coconut powder.
* [[Madras curry sauce|Madras curry]] – "the standard hot, slightly sour curry at the Indian restaurant."<ref name="Chapman, Pat 1988 p.34">Chapman, Pat. ''Favourite Restaurant Curries.'' (The Curry Club). (London: Piatkus, c.1988), p.34.</ref>
* [[Pasanda]] – in the UK, a mild curry sauce made with cream, coconut milk, and almonds or cashews, served with lamb, chicken, or king prawns (US: jumbo shrimp). The name is derives from a Mughlai dish of lamb strips beaten to make them tender.
* Naga curry – relatively new extremely hot dish with unique savoury taste made with the highly aromatic [[Ghost pepper|Naga Morich]] or Bhut Jolokia chili pepper.
* [[Pathia]] – a hot curry, generally similar to a "Madras" with the addition of lemon juice and tomato purée.
* [[Phall|Phaal]] – "this is the hottest curry the restaurants can make. There is nothing like it in India — it is pure invention."<ref>Chapman, Pat. ''Favourite Restaurant Curries.'' (The Curry Club). (London: Piatkus, c.1988), p.35.</ref>
* [[Rogan josh|Roghan josh]] – a medium-spicy curry, usually of lamb, with a deep red sauce containing tomatoes and paprika. It derives from a Kashmiri dish of the same name.
* [[Sambar (dish)|Sambar]] – medium-heat, sour curry made with lentils and tamarind.
* [[Vindaloo]] – generally regarded as the classic "hot" restaurant curry. Progressively hotter versions are sometimes called "tindaloo" and "bindaloo".<ref name="Chapman, Pat 1988 p.34"/>
<!-- although a true vindaloo does not specify any particular level of spiciness. The name has European origins, derived from the Portuguese term "vinha d'alhos", a marinade containing [[wine]] ("vinho"), or sometimes vinegar, and [[garlic]] ("alho"), used to prevent the pork from going off in hot weather.-->

The [[tandoor]] was introduced into Britain in the 1960s, and [[tandoori]] and tikka chicken became popular dishes.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Other dishes may feature with varying strengths, with those of north Indian origin, such as [[butter chicken]], tending to be mild, and recipes from the south of India tending to be hotter.

====Balti curries====
{{Main|Balti (food)}}
[[File:Balti gosht.jpg|thumb|right|A Balti lamb curry]]
Baltis are a style of curry thought to have been developed in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oed.com/bbcwordhunt/list.html#balti |title=Wordhunt appeal list - Balderdash Wordhunt - Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oed.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> which have spread to other western countries and are traditionally cooked and served in the same, typically cast iron pot called a '''balty'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-18490695 |title=BBC News - Birmingham Balti curry seeks EU protected status |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}</ref> It is also theorised that their origin may lay in the Pakistani region of [[Baltistan]], from where they spread to the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

====Curry house cuisine at home====
The popularity of curry houses in Britain has encouraged a number of publications aiming to show how the curry house cuisine, as opposed to authentic Indian cuisine, can be recreated at home. A notable publication is Kris Dhillon's book ''The Curry Secret'', which was first published in 1989 but has been reprinted as recently as 2008.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Dhillon | first = Kris | title = The Curry Secret | publisher = Right Way | isbn = 978-0-7160-2191-9}}</ref> Dhillon reports having had experience working in her own Indian-style restaurant before publishing the book.<ref>

The series consisted of three articles published in the [[Curry Club Magazine]].<ref>{{Cite news| last = Edwards | first = Bruce | title = Curry House Cookery | work = Curry Club Magazine, Winter issue 1990 }}</ref> Edwards published a follow-up series in the same magazine three years later, using information he had since learned from a behind-the-scenes look at an Indian take-away restaurant.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Edwards | first = Bruce | title = Curry House Cookery | work = Curry Club Magazine, first issue of 1993 }}</ref> Edwards' articles are still used as a reference by members of the online forum "Curry Recipes Online", where he has also informally published a few brief further follow-ups.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards | first = Bruce | title = Comments received from Bruce Edwards 14 October 2008 | url = http://cr0.co.uk/curry/index.php?topic=3074.0 | accessdate = 5 April 2010 }}</ref>

==Curry in the West Indies==
In the [[West Indies]], curry is a very popular dish. The Indian indentured servants that were brought over from India by different European powers, brought this dish, as well as their culture, to the West Indies. In Jamaica and Trinidad, curried goat is prominently featured. Curry can be found at both inexpensive and upscale Caribbean restaurants, and ingredients can range from chicken or vegetables to shellfish such as shrimp and scallops. Examples of curries in the West Indies include:

* [[Cuisine of Jamaica|Jamaica]]: Especially curried chicken, goat, fish and shrimp.
* [[Cuisine of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]]: Most notably curried chicken, duck, goat, beef (eaten by Muslims and Christians) shrimp, and curry aloo, along with various curried wild meats.
* [[Cuisine of Guyana|Guyana]]: Chicken curry, goat curry, duck curry, shrimp curry, beef curry (eaten by Muslims and Christians), aloo curry (potato), fish (different varieties) curry, etc.

==Curry powder==
{{Main| Curry powder}}
Curry powder is a spice mixture of widely varying composition developed by the British during the days of the ''[[British Raj|Raj]]'' as a means of approximating the taste of Indian cuisine at home. [[spice mix|Masala]] refers to spices, and this is the name given to the thick and pasty sauce based on a combination of spices with ghee (clarified butter), butter, palm oil or coconut milk. Most commercial curry powders available in Britain, the U.S. and Canada, rely heavily on ground [[turmeric]], in turn producing a very yellow sauce. Lesser ingredients in these Western yellow curry powders are often [[coriander]], cumin, [[fenugreek]], mustard, chili, black pepper and salt. By contrast, [[curry powder]]s and [[curry powder|curry pastes]] produced and consumed in India are extremely diverse; some red, some yellow, some brown; some with five spices and some with as many as 20 or more. Besides the previously mentioned spices, other commonly found spices in different curry powders in India are allspice, white pepper, ground mustard, ground ginger, cinnamon, roasted cumin, cloves, nutmeg, mace, green cardamom seeds or black cardamom pods, bay leaves and coriander seeds.

==Health benefits==
Some studies have shown that ingredients in curry may help to prevent certain diseases, including colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/597525.stm |title=HEALTH &#124; "Curry is cancer fighter" |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-01-10 |accessdate=2009-06-08 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1668932.stm |title=HEALTH &#124; Curry "may slow Alzheimer's" |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-11-21 |accessdate=2009-06-08 | location=London}}</ref>
A number of studies have claimed that the reaction of pain receptors to the hotter ingredients in curries leads to the body's release of [[endorphin]]s; curry is claimed to be one of the most powerful [[aphrodisiac]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/808411-chocolate-curry-launched-for-valentine-s-day|title=Chocolate curry launched for Valentine’s Day|publisher=Metro.co.uk|accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=August 2013}}{{Failed verification|date=August 2013}} With the complex sensory reaction to the variety of spices and flavours, a natural high is achieved that causes subsequent cravings, often followed by a desire to move on to hotter curries. Some refer to this as [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], but other researchers contest the use of the term "addiction" in this instance.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
