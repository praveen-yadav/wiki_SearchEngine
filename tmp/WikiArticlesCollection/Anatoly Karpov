'''Anatoly Yevgenyevich Karpov''', [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] ({{lang-ru|Анато́лий Евге́ньевич Ка́рпов}}, ''Anatolij Evgen'evič Karpov''; born May 23, 1951) is a Russian [[chess]] [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] and former [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]]. He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by [[Garry Kasparov]]. He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming [[FIDE]] World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE's new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world's elite, Karpov is considered one of the [[Comparison of top chess players throughout history|greatest players]] of all time.

His tournament successes include over 160 first-place finishes.<ref>{{cite web | first=Eric | last=van Reem | title=Karpov, Kortchnoi win Unzicker Gala | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2569 | publisher=[[ChessBase|ChessBase.com]] | date=2005-08-11 | accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref><ref>However, in his 1994 book "My Best Games" Karpov says he played some 200 tournaments and matches, and won more than 100.</ref> He had a peak [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] of 2780, and his 90 total months at world number one is [[List of FIDE chess world number ones|second all-time]] behind only [[Garry Kasparov]] since the inception of the FIDE ranking list in 1970.

Since 2005, he has been a member of the [[Public Chamber of Russia]]. He has recently involved himself in several humanitarian causes, such as advocating the use of [[iodised salt]].<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/reallives_1345.html Unicef website]</ref> On December 17, 2012, Karpov supported<ref>http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/79982</ref> the law in the Russian Parliament banning adoption of Russian orphans by citizens of the US.

==Early life==
Karpov was born on May 23, 1951 at [[Zlatoust]] in the [[Urals]] region of the former Soviet Union, and learned to play chess at the age of four. His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a [[Candidate Master]] by age eleven. At twelve, he was accepted into [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]'s prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following remark about the young Karpov: "The boy does not have a clue about chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?user=KingG|title=Anatoly Karpov's Best Games}}</ref> Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently.<ref name="KarpovOnKarpov">{{cite book | title=Karpov on Karpov: A Memoirs of a Chess World Champion | author=Karpov, A. | publisher=Atheneum | year=1992 | isbn=0-689-12060-5}}</ref> Karpov improved so quickly under Botvinnik's tutelage that he became the youngest [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record established by [[Boris Spassky]] in 1952.

==International career==

===Young master===
Karpov finished first in his first international tournament in [[Třinec]] several months later, ahead of [[Viktor Kupreichik]]. In 1967, he won the annual European Junior Championship at [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/EU-ch_U18_f-A_6768_1967/26508 |title=EU-ch U18 f-A 6768 1967 - 365Chess.com Tournaments |publisher=365chess.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref> Karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school, and entered [[Moscow State University]] in 1968 to study [[mathematics]]. He later transferred to [[Leningrad State University]], eventually graduating from there in [[economics]]. One reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach, grandmaster [[Semyon Furman]], who lived in Leningrad. In his writings, Karpov credits Furman as a major influence on his development as a world-class player.

In 1969, Karpov became the first Soviet player since Spassky (1955) to win the [[World Junior Chess Championship]], scoring an undefeated 10/11 in the finals at [[Stockholm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/Wch_U20_fin-A_1969/26788 |title=Wch U20 fin-A 1969 - 365Chess.com Tournaments |publisher=365chess.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref> In 1970, he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/Caracas_1970/22885 |title=Caracas 1970 - 365Chess.com Tournaments |publisher=365chess.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref> and was awarded the [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] title.

===Top-Class Grandmaster===
He won the 1971 [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]] Memorial in Moscow (equal with [[Leonid Stein]]), ahead of a star-studded field, for his first significant adult victory. His [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he shared second in the [[USSR Chess Championship]], and finished equal first with [[Viktor Korchnoi]] in the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] [[Interzonal]] Tournament, with the latter success qualifying him for the 1974 [[Candidates Matches]], which would determine the challenger of the reigning world champion, [[Bobby Fischer]].

===Candidate===
Karpov defeated [[Lev Polugaevsky]] by the score of +3 =5 in the first Candidates' match, earning the right to face former champion [[Boris Spassky]] in the semifinal round. Karpov was on record saying that he believed Spassky would easily beat him and win the Candidates' cycle to face Fischer, and that he (Karpov) would win the following Candidates' cycle in 1977.
Spassky won the first game as Black in good style, but tenacious, aggressive play from Karpov secured him overall victory by +4 −1 =6.
The Candidates' final was played in Moscow with Korchnoi. Karpov took an early lead, winning the second game against the [[Sicilian Defence|Sicilian Dragon]], then scoring another victory in the sixth game. Following ten consecutive [[draw (chess)|draws]], Korchnoi threw away a winning position in the seventeenth game to give Karpov a 3–0 lead. In game 19, Korchnoi succeeded in winning a long [[chess endgame|endgame]], then notched a speedy victory after a [[blunder (chess)|blunder]] by Karpov two games later. Three more draws, the last [[draw by agreement|agreed]] by Karpov in a clearly better position, closed the match, as he thus prevailed +3 −2 =19, moving on to challenge Fischer for the world title.

===Match with Fischer in 1975===
Though a world championship match between Karpov and Fischer was highly anticipated, those hopes were never realised. Fischer insisted that the match be the first to ten wins ([[draw (chess)|draws]] not counting), but that the champion would retain the crown if the score was tied 9–9. [[FIDE]], the International Chess Federation, refused to allow this proviso, and after Fischer's resignation of the championship on June 27, 1974, FIDE declared that Fischer forfeited his crown. Karpov later attempted to set up another match with Fischer, but all the negotiations fell through. This thrust the young Karpov into the role of World Champion without having faced the reigning champion.
[[Garry Kasparov]] argued that Karpov would have had good chances, because he had beaten Spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional, and indeed had higher quality games, while Fischer had been inactive for three years.<ref>''Kasparov, [[My Great Predecessors]], part IV: Fischer, p. 474''</ref> Spassky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Karpov would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978.<ref>In [http://www.chesscafe.com/text/polgar26.pdf an article] (PDF) published in 2004 on the Chesscafe website [[Susan Polgar]] wrote: "I spoke to Boris Spassky about this same issue and he believes that Bobby would have won in 1975, but that Anatoly would have won the rematch."</ref>

===World champion===<!-- This section is linked from [[World Chess Championship]] -->
Determined to prove himself a legitimate champion, Karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years. He convincingly won the very strong [[Milan]] tournament in 1975, and captured his first of three Soviet titles in 1976. He created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world. Karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories (nine) until it was shattered by [[Garry Kasparov]] (14).
In 1978, Karpov's first title defence was against Korchnoi, the opponent he had defeated in the 1973–75 Candidates' cycle; the match was played at [[Baguio]], [[Philippines]], with the winner needing six victories.
As in 1974, Karpov took an early lead, winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match, but Korchnoi staged a comeback late in the match, as, after the score was +5 −2 =20 in Karpov's favour, he won three of the next four games to draw level, with Karpov then winning the next game to retain the title (+6 −5 =21).

Three years later Korchnoi re-emerged as the Candidates' winner against German finalist Dr. [[Robert Hübner]] to challenge Karpov in [[Merano]], [[Italy]]. This match, however, was won handily by Karpov, the score being (11&ndash;7, +6 −2 =10) in what is remembered as the "Massacre in Merano".

Karpov's tournament career reached a peak at the [[Montreal]] "Tournament of Stars" tournament in 1979, where he finished joint first (+7 −1 =10) with [[Mikhail Tal]], ahead of a field of strong grandmasters completed by [[Jan Timman]], [[Ljubomir Ljubojević]], Spassky, [[Vlastimil Hort]], [[Lajos Portisch]], Huebner, [[Bent Larsen]] and [[Lubomir Kavalek]]. He dominated [[Las Palmas]] 1977 with 13½/15. He also won the prestigious [[Bugojno]] tournament in 1978 (shared) and 1980, the [[Linares chess tournament|Linares tournament]] in 1981 (shared with [[Larry Christiansen]]) and 1994, the [[Tilburg]] tournament in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983, and the [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Championship]] in 1976, 1983, and 1988.

Karpov represented the Soviet Union at six [[Chess Olympiads]], in all of which the USSR won the team gold medal. He played first reserve at [[20th Chess Olympiad|Skopje 1972]], winning the board prize with 13/15. At [[21st Chess Olympiad|Nice 1974]], he advanced to board one and again won the board prize with 12/14. At [[24th Chess Olympiad|La Valletta 1980]], he was again board one and scored 9/12. At [[25th Chess Olympiad|Lucerne 1982]], he scored 6½/8 on board one. At [[27th Chess Olympiad|Dubai 1986]], he scored 6/9 on board two. His last was [[28th Chess Olympiad|Thessaloniki 1988]], where on board two he scored 8/10. In Olympiad play, Karpov lost only two games out of 68 played.

To illustrate Karpov's dominance over his peers as champion, his score was +11 −2 =20 versus Spassky, +5 =12 versus [[Robert Hübner]], +6 −1 =16 versus [[Ulf Andersson]], +3 −1 =10 versus [[Vasily Smyslov]], +1 =16 versus [[Mikhail Tal]], +10 −2 =13 versus Ljubojević.

Karpov had cemented his position as the world's best player and world champion by the time [[Garry Kasparov]] arrived on the scene. In their first match, the [[World Chess Championship 1984]], held in Moscow, with the victor again being the first to win six games outright, Karpov built a 4–0 lead after nine games. The next seventeen games were drawn, setting the record for world title matches, and it took Karpov until game 27 to gain his fifth win. In game 31, Karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw. He lost the next game, after which fourteen more draws ensued. In particular, Karpov held a solidly winning position in Game 41, but again blundered and had to settle for a draw. After Kasparov won games 47 and 48, FIDE President [[Florencio Campomanes]] unilaterally terminated the match, citing the health of the players.<ref>[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/84kk$$.htm 1984 Karpov–Kasparov Title Match Highlights] Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref> The match had lasted an unprecedented five months, with five wins for Karpov, three for Kasparov, and forty draws.

A rematch was set for later in 1985, also in Moscow. The events of the so-called Marathon Match forced FIDE to return to the previous format, a match limited to 24 games (with Karpov remaining champion if the match should finish 12–12). Karpov needed to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title, but wound up losing, thus surrendering the title to his opponent. The final score was 13-11 (+3 −5 =16), in favour of Kasparov.

===Rivalry with Kasparov===
Karpov remained a formidable opponent (and the world #2) until the early 1990s. He fought Kasparov in three more world championship matches in 1986 (held in London and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]), 1987 (held in [[Seville]]), and 1990 (held in New York City and [[Lyon]]). All three matches were extremely close: the scores were 11½ to 12½ (+4 −5 =15), 12 to 12 (+4 −4 =16), and 11½ to 12½ (+3 −4 =17). In all three matches, Karpov had winning chances up to the very last games. In particular, the 1987 Seville match featured an astonishing blunder by Kasparov in the 23rd game. In the final game, needing only a draw to win the title, Karpov cracked under pressure from the clock at the end of the first session of play, missed a variation leading to an almost forced draw, and allowed Kasparov to adjourn the game with an extra pawn. After a further mistake in the second session, Karpov was slowly ground down and resigned on move 64, ending the match and allowing Kasparov to keep the title.

In their five world championship matches, Karpov scored 19 wins, 21 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.

Karpov is on record saying that if he had the opportunity to play Fischer for the crown in his twenties, he could have been a much better player as a result.

===FIDE champion again (1993–99)===
[[Image:Anatoly Karpov.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Karpov in 1996]]
In 1992, Karpov lost a Candidates Match against [[Nigel Short]]. But in 1993, Karpov reacquired the FIDE World Champion title when Kasparov and Short split from FIDE. Karpov defeated Timman – the loser of the Candidates' final against Short.

The next major meeting of Kasparov and Karpov was the 1994 [[Linares chess tournament]]. The field, in eventual finishing order, was Karpov, [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], [[Alexei Shirov|Shirov]], [[Evgeny Bareev|Bareev]], [[Vladimir Kramnik|Kramnik]], [[Joël Lautier|Lautier]], [[Viswanathan Anand|Anand]], [[Gata Kamsky|Kamsky]], [[Veselin Topalov|Topalov]], [[Vassily Ivanchuk|Ivanchuk]], [[Boris Gelfand|Gelfand]], [[Miguel Illescas|Illescas]], [[Judit Polgár]], and [[Alexander Beliavsky|Beliavsky]]; with an average [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] of 2685, the highest ever at that time, making it the first Category XVIII tournament ever held. Impressed by the strength of the tournament, Kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightly be called the world champion of tournaments. Perhaps spurred on by this comment, Karpov played the best tournament of his life. He was undefeated and earned 11 points out of 13 possible (the best world-class tournament winning percentage since Alekhine won [[San Remo 1930 chess tournament|San Remo in 1930]]), finishing 2½ points ahead of second-place Kasparov and Shirov. Many of his wins were spectacular (in particular, his win over Topalov is considered possibly the finest of his career). This performance against the best players in the world put his [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] tournament performance at 2985, the highest [[Performance rating (chess)|performance rating]] of any player in history up until 2009, when [[Magnus Carlsen]] won the category XXI [[Pearl Spring chess tournament]] with a performance of 3002. However, chess statistician [[Jeff Sonas]] still considers Karpov's Linares performance as the best tournament result in history.<ref>[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5828 Facts and figures: Magnus Carlsen's performance in Nanjing]. ChessBase.com. Retrieved on 2009-10-26.</ref>

Karpov defended his FIDE title against [[Gata Kamsky]] (+6 −3 =9) in 1996. However, in 1998, FIDE largely scrapped the old system of Candidates' Matches, instead having a large knockout event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks. In the first of these events, the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1998]], champion Karpov was seeded straight into the final, defeating [[Viswanathan Anand]]  (+2 −2 =2, rapid tiebreak 2:0). In the subsequent cycle, the format was changed, with the champion having to qualify. Karpov refused to defend his title, and ceased to be FIDE World Champion after the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1999]].

===Towards retirement===
Karpov's outstanding classical tournament play has been seriously limited since 1995, since he prefers to be more involved in politics of his home country of Russia. He had been a member of the [[Supreme Soviet]] Commission for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Soviet Peace Fund before the Soviet Union dissolved. In addition, he had been involved in several disputes with FIDE and became increasingly disillusioned with chess. In the September 2009 FIDE rating list, he dropped out of the world's Top 100 for the first time.

Karpov usually limits his play to exhibition events, and has revamped his style to specialize in rapid chess. In 2002 he won a match against Kasparov, defeating him in a rapid time control match 2½–1½. In 2006, he tied for first with Kasparov in a blitz tournament, ahead of Korchnoi and Judit Polgár.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3310|title=The Credit Suisse Blitz – in pictures|date=2006-08-27|publisher=ChessBase|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>

Karpov and Kasparov played a mixed 12-game match from September 21–24, 2009, in [[Valencia]], Spain. It consisted of four rapid (or semi rapid) and eight blitz games and took place exactly 25 years after the two players' legendary encounter at [[World Chess Championship 1984]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://previews.chessdom.com/kasparov-karpov-valencia-2009 |title=Kasparov and Karpov to play 12 games match in Valencia |accessdate=2009-07-08 |publisher=Chessdom}}</ref> Kasparov won the match 9–3.

Karpov played a match against [[Yasser Seirawan]] in 2012 in St Louis, Missouri, an important center of the North American chess scene, with Anatoly Karpov winning the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saintlouischessclub.org/news/2012-06-12/karpov-seirawan-head-rapid-play-saint-louis|title=Karpov, Seirawan Head to Rapid Play in Saint Louis |publisher=St Louis Chess Club|accessdate= 12 june 2012}}</ref>

In November 2012, he won the Cap d'Agde rapid tournament which bears his name (Anatoly Karpov Trophy) by beating Vassily Ivanchuk (ranked 9th in the October 2012 FIDE world rankings) in the final.

==Candidate to FIDE Presidency==
In March 2010 Karpov announced that he would be a candidate for the presidency of FIDE. The election took place in September 2010 at the [[39th Chess Olympiad]].<ref>[http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/karpov-candidate-for-fide-president/#more-22636 chessvibes article]</ref> In May a fund-raising event took place in New York with the participation of his former rival Garry Kasparov and of Magnus Carlsen, both of whom supported his bid and campaigned for him.<ref>[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=6343 Chessbase article on New York event]</ref> Also Nigel Short has announced he supported Karpov's candidacy. However, on September 29, 2010, [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]] was reelected as President of FIDE, winning the election by 95 votes to 55.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://reports.chessdom.com/news-2010/fide-elections-2010-ilyumzhinov-karpov |title=Kirsan Ilyumzhinov wins 2010 FIDE elections |work=Chessdom.com |year=2010}}</ref>

==Style==
Karpov's "[[boa constrictor]]" playing style is solidly positional,<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Lubomir Kavalek|Kavalek, Lubomir]]|title=Chess|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/24/AR2007062401102.html|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=2007-06-25|accessdate=2008-04-25}}</ref> taking no risks but reacting mercilessly to any tiny errors made by his opponents. As a result, he is often compared to his idol, the famous [[José Raúl Capablanca]], the third World Champion. Karpov himself describes his style as follows:<blockquote>Let us say the game may be continued in two ways: one of them is a beautiful tactical blow that gives rise to variations that don't yield to precise calculation; the other is clear positional pressure that leads to an endgame with microscopic chances of victory.... I would choose the latter without thinking twice. If the opponent offers keen play I don't object; but in such cases I get less satisfaction, even if I win, than from a game conducted according to all the rules of strategy with its ruthless logic.</blockquote>

==Notable games==
