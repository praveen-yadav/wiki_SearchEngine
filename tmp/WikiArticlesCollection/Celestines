'''Celestines''' were a [[Roman Catholic]] [[monasticism|monastic]] [[Order (religious)|order]], a branch of the [[Benedictine]]s, founded in 1244.<ref>{{cite book|title=Between Church and State: The Lives of Four French Prelates in the Late Middle Ages|first1=Bernard|first2=Arthur |last2=Goldhammer|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year= 1991|isbn=0-226-31032-9}}</ref> At the foundation of the new rule, they were called [[Hermit]]s of St Damiano, or Moronites (or Murronites), and did not assume the appellation of Celestines until after the election of their founder to the [[Papacy]] as [[Pope Celestine V|Celestine V]].<ref>{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16019a.htm|title=Celestine Order}}</ref> The fame of the holy life and the austerities practised by the hermit in his solitude on the Mountain of Majella, near [[Sulmona]], attracted many visitors, several of whom were moved to remain and share his mode of life. They built a small [[convent]] on the spot inhabited by the holy hermit, which became too small for the accommodation of those who came to share their life of privations. Peter of Morone, their founder built a number of other small [[Oratory (worship)|oratories]] in that neighborhood.

==Founding==
This happened about the year 1254. A new religious community was formed, and Peter of Morone gave them a rule formulated in accordance with his own practices. In 1264 the new institution was approved by [[Pope Urban IV|Urban IV]]. The founder, having heard that it was probable that [[Pope Gregory X]], then holding a council at [[Lyon]], would suppress all such new orders as had been founded since the [[Lateran Council]], having commanded that such institutions should not be further multiplied, went to Lyon. There he  succeeded in persuading Gregory to approve his new order, making it a branch of the Benedictines and following the [[Rule of St Benedict|rule of Saint Benedict]], but adding to it additional severities and privations. Gregory took it under the Papal protection, assured to it the possession of all property it might acquire, and endowed it with exemption from the authority of the ordinary. Nothing more was needed to ensure the rapid spread of the new association and Peter the hermit of Morone lived to see himself "Superior-General" to thirty-six [[monastery|monasteries]] and more than six hundred [[monk]]s. Peter, however, cannot be accused of ambition or the lust of power when a monastic superior, any more than when he insisted on divesting himself of the Papacy, to which he was subsequently raised. 

As soon as he had seen his new order thus consolidated he gave up the government of it to a certain Robert, and retired once again to a still more remote solitude to give himself up more entirely to solitary penance and prayer. Shortly afterwards, in a chapter of the order held in 1293, the original monastery of Majella being judged to be too desolate and exposed to too rigorous a climate, it was decided that the monastery which had been founded in Sulmtona should be the headquarters of the order and the residence of the General-Superior, as it has continued to be to the present day. The next year Peter of Morrone, having been, despite his reluctance, elected Pope by the name of Celestine V, the order he had founded took the name of Celestines. The hermit Pope found time in the few short months of his Papacy to confirm the rule of the order, which he had himself composed, and to confer on the society a variety of special graces and privileges. In the only creation of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s promoted by him, among the twelve raised to the purple, there were two monks of his order. He found time also to visit personally the great Benedictine monastery on [[Monte Cassino]], where he succeeded in persuading the monks to accept his more rigorous rule. He sent fifty monks of his order to introduce it, who remained, however, for only a few months.

After the death of the founder the order was favoured and privileged by [[Pope Benedict XI|Benedict XI]], and rapidly spread through [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Flanders]], and [[France]], where they were received by [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] in 1300. Subsequently the French Celestines, with the consent of the Italian superiors of the order, and of [[Pope Martin V]] in 1427, obtained the privilege of making new constitutions for themselves, which they did in the 17th century in a series of regulations accepted by the provincial chapter in 1667. At that time the French congregation of the order was composed of twenty-one monasteries, the head of which was that of [[Paris]], and was governed by a Provincial with the authority of General. [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]] was a notable benefactor of the order. But in consequence of later political changes and events the order has been dissolved.

==Description of order==
According to their special constitutions the Celestines were bound to say [[matins]] in the [[choir]] at two o'clock in the morning, and always to abstain from eating meat, save in illness. The distinct rules of their order with regard to [[fasting]] are numerous, but not more severe than those of similar congregations, though much more so than is required by the old Benedictine rule. In reading their minute directions for divers degrees of abstinence on various days, it is impossible to avoid being struck by the conviction that the great object of the framers of these rules was the general purpose of ensuring an [[asceticism|ascetic]] mode of life.

The Celestines wore a white [[wool]]len [[cassock]] bound with a [[linen]] band, and a [[leather]]n [[girdle]] of the same colour, with a [[scapular]] unattached to the body of the dress, and a black [[hood (headgear)|hood]]. It was not permitted to them to wear any shirt save of [[serge]]. Their dress in short was very like that of the [[Cistercians]]. But it is a tradition in the order that in the time of the founder they wore a coarse brown cloth. The church and monastery of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] originally belonged to the Celestines in [[Rome]]; but they were turned out of it by [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]] to make way for [[Franciscan]]s, receiving from the Pope in exchange the Church of [[St Eusebius of Vercelli]] with the adjacent mansion for a monastery.
