The '''Anglican Communion''' is an international association of churches consisting of the [[Church of England]] and of national and regional [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches in [[full communion]] with it<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stfrancisooltewah.org/id4.html |title=St Francis of Assisi Episcopal Church History |publdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> and specifically with its principal [[primate (bishop)|primate]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aco.org/communion/abc/index.cfm |title=The Archbishop of Canterbury is the Focus for Unity |publisher=Aco.org |date=2003-02-27 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> There is no single "Anglican Church" with universal juridical authority as each national or regional church has full autonomy. 

The status of full communion means, ideally, that there is mutual agreement on essential doctrines and that full participation in the sacramental life of each church is available to all [[communicant]] Anglicans.

With a membership currently estimated at around 80 million members worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/tour/index.cfm |title=The Anglican Communion Official website - Provincial Registry |publisher=Anglicancommunion.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> the Anglican Communion is the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es. Some of these churches are known as Anglican, such as the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], due to their historical link to England (''Ecclesia Anglicana'' means "English Church"). Some, for example the [[Church of Ireland]], the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish]] and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|American]] Episcopal churches, and some other associated churches have a separate name. Each church has its own [[Anglican doctrine|doctrine]] and [[liturgy]], based in most cases on that of the Church of England; and each church has its own legislative process and overall [[episcopal polity]], under the leadership of a local primate.

The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], religious head of the Church of England, has no formal authority outside that jurisdiction, but is recognised as symbolic head of the worldwide communion. Among the other primates, he is considered as ''[[primus inter pares]]''.

The Anglican Communion considers itself to be part of the [[One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church]] and to be both [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Protestant|Reformed]]. For some adherents it represents a non-papal Catholicism, for others a form of [[Protestantism]] though without a dominant guiding figure such as [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[John Knox|Knox]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]] or [[John Wesley|Wesley]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Avis|first=Paul|chapter=What is 'Anglicanism'?|title=The Study of Anglicanism|editor=S. Sykes and J. Booty (eds)|location=London|publisher=SPCK|year=1988|pages=417–19}}</ref> For others, their self-identity represents some combination of the two. The communion encompasses a wide spectrum of belief and practice including [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]], and [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic]].

The Anglican Communion Office is headed by its Secretary General, the Reverend Canon Kenneth Kearon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2004/7/20/ACNS3855 |title=Archbishop announces new Anglican Communion Secretary General |accessdate=14 March 2011 |date=20 July 2004 |work=Anglican Communion News Service |publisher=Anglican Communion Office}}</ref>

==Ecclesiology, polity and ethos==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
{{Main|Anglican doctrine}}
The Anglican Communion has no official legal existence nor any governing structure which might exercise authority over the member churches. There is an Anglican Communion Office in London, under the aegis of the Archbishop of Canterbury, but it only serves in a supporting and organisational role. The Communion is held together by a shared history, expressed in its [[ecclesiology]], [[polity]] and [[ethos]] and also by participation in international consultative bodies.

Three elements have been important in holding the Communion together: first, the shared ecclesial structure of the component churches, manifested in an [[episcopal polity]] maintained through the [[apostolic succession]] of bishops and [[synod]]ical government; second, the principle of belief expressed in worship, investing importance in approved prayer books and their rubrics; and third, the historical documents and the writings of early Anglican [[divinity (academic discipline)|divines]] that have influenced the ethos of the Communion.

Originally, the Church of England was self-contained and relied for its unity and identity on its own history, its traditional legal and episcopal structure and its status as an [[established church]] of the state. As such Anglicanism was, from the outset, a movement with an explicitly [[episcopal polity]], a characteristic which has been vital in maintaining the unity of the Communion by conveying the episcopate's role in manifesting visible catholicity and ecumenism.

Early in its development, Anglicanism developed a vernacular prayer book, called the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. Unlike other traditions, Anglicanism has never been governed by a [[magisterium]] nor by appeal to one founding [[theology|theologian]], nor by an extra-credal summary of doctrine (such as the [[Westminster Confession]] of the [[Presbyterian]] Church). Instead, Anglicans have typically appealed to the Book of Common Prayer (1662) and its offshoots as a guide to Anglican theology and practice. This had the effect of inculcating the principle of ''[[lex orandi, lex credendi]]'' ("the law of prayer is the law of belief") as the foundation of Anglican identity and confession.

Protracted conflict through the seventeenth century with more radical [[Protestant]]s on the one hand and Roman Catholics who still recognised the primacy of the [[Pope]] on the other, resulted in an association of churches that were both deliberately vague about doctrinal principles, yet bold in developing parameters of acceptable deviation. These parameters were most clearly articulated in the various [[rubric]]s of the successive prayer books, as well as the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of Religion. These Articles (though no longer binding) have had an influence on the ethos of the Communion, an ethos reinforced by their interpretation and expansion by such influential early theologians as [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]], [[Lancelot Andrewes]], [[John Cosin]], and others.

With the expansion of the [[British Empire]], and hence the growth of Anglicanism outside Great Britain and Ireland, the Communion sought to establish new vehicles of unity. The first major expression of this were the [[Lambeth Conference]]s of the communion's bishops, first convened by Archbishop of Canterbury [[Charles Longley]] in 1867. From the outset, these were not intended to displace the autonomy of the emerging provinces of the Communion, but to "discuss matters of practical interest, and pronounce what we deem expedient in resolutions which may serve as safe guides to future action."

==Chicago Lambeth Quadrilateral==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
One of the enduringly influential early resolutions of the conference was the so-called [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]] of 1888. Its intent was to provide the basis for discussions of reunion with the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches, but it had the ancillary effect of establishing parameters of Anglican identity. It establishes four principles with these words:

:That, in the opinion of this Conference, the following Articles supply a basis on which approach may be by God's blessing made towards Home Reunion:

:(a) The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as "containing all things necessary to salvation," and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith.
:(b) The [[Apostles' Creed]], as the Baptismal Symbol; and the [[Nicene Creed]], as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith.
:(c) The two Sacraments ordained by Christ Himself - Baptism and the [[Eucharist|Supper of the Lord]] - ministered with unfailing use of Christ's [[Words of Institution]], and of the elements ordained by Him.
:(d) The [[Historic Episcopate]], locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the Unity of His Church.<ref>The Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church, Seabury Press, 1979, page 877</ref>

==Instruments of communion==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}
As mentioned above, the Anglican Communion has no international juridical organisation. The Archbishop of Canterbury's role is strictly symbolic and unifying and the Communion's three international bodies are consultative and collaborative, their resolutions having no legal effect on the autonomous provinces of the Communion. Taken together, however, the four do function as "instruments of communion", since all churches of the communion participate in them. In order of antiquity, they are:

[[File:Canterburycathedralthrone.jpg|thumb|The Chair of St Augustine (the episcopal throne in [[Canterbury Cathedral]], Kent), seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury in his role as head of the Anglican Communion<ref>The Chair of St Augustine is the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury in his role as head of the Anglican Communion. Archbishops of Canterbury are enthroned twice: firstly as diocesan Ordinary (and Metropolitan and Primate of the Church of England) in the archbishop's throne, by the [[Archdeacon of Canterbury]]; and secondly as leader of the worldwide church in the Chair of St Augustine by the senior (by length of service) Archbishop of the Anglican Communion. The stone chair is therefore of symbolic significance throughout Anglicanism.</ref>]]
# The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (''ab origine'') functions as the spiritual head of the Communion. He is the focus of unity, since no church claims membership in the Communion without being in communion with him. The present incumbent is [[Justin Welby]].
# The [[Lambeth Conference]] (first held in 1867) is the oldest international consultation. It is a forum for bishops of the Communion to reinforce unity and collegiality through manifesting the [[episcopate]], to discuss matters of mutual concern, and to pass resolutions intended to act as guideposts. It is held roughly every ten years and invitation is by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
# The [[Anglican Consultative Council]] (first met in 1971) was created by a 1968 Lambeth Conference resolution, and meets usually at three-yearly intervals. The council consists of representative bishops, clergy, and laity chosen by the thirty-eight provinces. The body has a permanent secretariat, the Anglican Communion Office, of which the Archbishop of Canterbury is president.
# The [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting|Primates' Meeting]] (first met in 1979) is the most recent manifestation of international consultation and deliberation, having been first convened by Archbishop [[Donald Coggan]] as a forum for "leisurely thought, prayer and deep consultation".

Since there is no binding authority in the Communion, these international bodies are a vehicle for consultation and persuasion. In recent years, persuasion has tipped over into debates over conformity in certain areas of doctrine, discipline, worship, and ethics. The most notable example has been the objection of many provinces of the Communion (particularly in Africa and Asia) to the changing role of homosexuals in the North American churches (e.g., by [[same-sex unions|blessing same-sex unions]] and ordaining and consecrating gays and lesbians in same-sex relationships), and to the process by which changes were undertaken. 

Those who objected condemned these actions as unscriptural, unilateral, and without the agreement of the Communion prior to these steps being taken. In response, the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|American Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] answered that the actions had been undertaken after lengthy scriptural and theological reflection, legally in accordance with their own [[canon law|canons and constitutions]] and after extensive consultation with the provinces of the Communion.

The Primates' Meeting voted to request the two churches to withdraw their delegates from the 2005 meeting of the Anglican Consultative Council. Canada and the United States decided to attend the meeting but without exercising their right to vote. They have not been expelled or suspended, since there is no mechanism in this voluntary association to suspend or expel an independent province of the Communion. Since membership is based on a province's communion with Canterbury, expulsion would require the Archbishop of Canterbury's refusal to be in communion with the affected jurisdiction(s). In line with the suggestion of the [[Windsor Report]], [[Rowan Williams]] (the previous Archbishop of Canterbury) recently established a working group to examine the feasibility of an Anglican covenant which would articulate the conditions for communion in some fashion.<ref>[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/articles/41/50/acns4164.cfm Archbishop of Canterbury: address to General Synod on the Anglican Communion, ACNS 4164, 7 July 2006]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|History of the Anglican Communion}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
The Anglican Communion traces much of its growth to the older mission organisations of the Church of England such as the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] (founded 1698), the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]] (founded 1701) and the [[Church Missionary Society]] (founded 1799).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cms-uk.org/Whoweare/AboutCMS/History/tabid/181/language/en-US/Default.aspx|title=A brief history of CMS|year=1999|publisher=Church Mission Society|accessdate=2 December 2012|quote=Much of what we call the Anglican Communion today traces its origins to CMS work.}}</ref><ref name="Melton2005">{{cite book|last=Melton|first=J.

Though later in date than the S.P.C.K. and the S.P.G. it became the first effective organ of the C. of E. for missions to the heathen... Its theology has been consistently Evangelical."--Cross, F. L., ed. (1957) ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. London: Oxford University Press; p. 305</ref> The [[Church of England]] (which until the 20th century included the [[Church in Wales]]) initially separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1538 in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], reunited in 1555 under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] and then separated again in 1570 under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] (the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated Elizabeth I in 1570 in response to the [[Act of Supremacy 1559]]).  

The [[Church of England]] has always thought of itself not as a new foundation but rather as a reformed continuation of the ancient "English Church" (''Ecclesia Anglicana'') and a reassertion of that church's rights. As such it was a distinctly national phenomenon. The [[Church of Scotland]] separated from the Roman Catholic Church with the [[Scottish Reformation]] in 1560 and the split from it of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] began in 1582 in the reign of [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]] over disagreements about the role of bishops.

The oldest-surviving Anglican church outside of the British Isles (Britain and Ireland) is [[St. Peter's Church, St. George's|St Peter's Church]] in [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], [[Bermuda]], established in 1612 (though the actual building had to be rebuilt several times over the following century). This is also the oldest surviving non-Roman Catholic church in the [[New World]]. It remained part of the Church of England until 1978 when the [[Anglican Church of Bermuda]] separated. The Church of England was the established church not only in England, but in its trans-Oceanic colonies.

Thus the only member churches of the present Anglican Communion existing by the mid-18th century were the Church of England, its closely linked sister church, the [[Church of Ireland]] (which also separated from Roman Catholicism under Henry VIII) and the Scottish Episcopal Church which for parts of the 17th and 18th centuries was partially underground (it was suspected of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies).

=== Global spread of Anglicanism ===
The enormous expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries of the [[British Empire]] brought Anglicanism along with it. At first all these colonial churches were under the jurisdiction of the [[Bishop of London]]. After the [[American Revolution]], the parishes in the newly independent country found it necessary to break formally from a church whose [[Supreme Governor]] was (and remains) the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]]. Thus they formed their own dioceses and national church, the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], in a mostly amicable separation.

At about the same time, in the colonies which remained linked to the crown, the Church of England began to appoint colonial bishops. In 1787 a bishop of [[Nova Scotia]] was appointed with a jurisdiction over all of British North America; in time several more colleagues were appointed to other cities in present-day Canada. In 1814 a bishop of [[Calcutta]] was made; in 1824 the first bishop was sent to the [[West Indies]] and in 1836 to Australia. By 1840 there were still only ten colonial bishops for the Church of England; but even this small beginning greatly facilitated the growth of Anglicanism around the world. In 1841 a "Colonial Bishoprics Council" was set up and soon many more dioceses were created.

In time, it became natural to group these into provinces and a [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] was appointed for each province. Although it had at first been somewhat established in many colonies, in 1861 it was ruled that, except where specifically established, the Church of England had just the same legal position as any other church. Thus a colonial bishop and colonial diocese was by nature quite a different thing from their counterparts back home. In time bishops came to be appointed locally rather than from England and eventually national synods began to pass ecclesiastical legislation independent of England.

A crucial step in the development of the modern communion was the idea of the [[Lambeth Conference]]s (discussed above). These conferences demonstrated that the bishops of disparate churches could manifest the unity of the church in their episcopal collegiality despite the absence of universal legal ties. Some bishops were initially reluctant to attend, fearing that the meeting would declare itself a council with power to legislate for the church; but it agreed to pass only advisory resolutions. These Lambeth Conferences have been held roughly every 10 years since 1878 (the second such conference) and remain the most visible coming-together of the whole Communion.

==Ecumenical relations==
{{details|Anglican Communion and ecumenism|the ongoing dialogue between Anglicanism and the wider Church}}

==Historic episcopate==
The churches of the Anglican Communion have traditionally held that ordination in the [[historic episcopate]] is a core element in the validity of clerical ordinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/whipple/unity1896/ |title=Unity and the Lambeth Declaration, a collection of essays about the Quadrilateral |publisher=Anglicanhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> The Roman Catholic Church does not recognise most Anglican orders (see ''[[Apostolicae Curae]]'').<ref name="cepope">{{ws|"[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Apostolicae Curae|Apostolicae Curae]]" in the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''}}</ref> Some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es have issued statements to the effect that Anglican orders could be accepted, yet have still reordained former Anglican clergy; other Orthodox churches have rejected Anglican orders altogether. Orthodox bishop [[Kallistos Ware]] explains this apparent discrepancy as follows:

''Anglican clergy who join the Orthodox Church are reordained; but [some Orthodox Churches hold that] if Anglicanism and Orthodoxy were to reach full unity in the faith, perhaps such reordination might not be found necessary. It should be added, however, that a number of individual Orthodox theologians hold that under no circumstances would it be possible to recognise the validity of Anglican Orders.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/history_timothy_ware_2.htm |title=Excerpts from the Orthodox Church by Bishop Kallistos Ware |publisher=Fatheralexander.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

==Controversies==
{{See also|Homosexuality and Anglicanism|Anglican realignment}}
One effect of the Communion's dispersed authority has been that conflict and controversy can arise over the effect divergent practices and doctrines in one part of the Communion have on others.<ref>McKinnon, A.; Trzebiatowska, M. & Brittain, C. (2011). 'Bourdieu, Capital and Conflict in a Religious Field: The Case of the Anglican Communion'. ''Journal of Contemporary Religion''; vol 26, no. 3, pp. 355-370.</ref> Disputes that had been confined to the Church of England could be dealt with legislatively in that realm, but as the Communion spread out into new nations and disparate cultures, such controversies multiplied and intensified. These controversies have generally been of two types: liturgical and social.<ref>Chapman, M. ''Anglicanism: a very short introduction'',  Oxford: Oxford University Press (2006)</ref>

;Anglo-Catholicism
The first such controversy of note concerned that of the growing influence of the [[Catholic Revival]] manifested in the [[tractarian]] and so-called [[ritualism]] controversies of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<ref>Pickering, W. S. F. (1989) ''Anglo-Catholicism: a study in religious ambiguity.'' London: Routledge</ref> This controversy produced the [[Free Church of England]] and, in the United States and Canada, the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]].

;Social changes
Later, rapid social change and the dissipation of British [[cultural hegemony]] over its former colonies contributed to disputes over the role of women, the parameters of marriage and divorce, and the practices of [[contraception]] and [[abortion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In the late 1970s, the [[Continuing Anglican movement]] produced a number of new church bodies in opposition to women's ordination, prayer book changes, and the new  understandings concerning marriage. 

More recently, disagreements over homosexuality have strained the unity of the Communion as well as its relationships with other Christian denominations, leading to another round of withdrawals from the Anglican Communion.<ref name="A. McKinnon, pp.351-373">"Homosexuality and the Construction of ‘Anglican Orthodoxy’: The Symbolic Politics of the Anglican Communion", C. Brittain and A. McKinnon, ''Sociology of Religion'', vol. 72, no.3, pp. 351-373 (2011).</ref> Some churches founded outside the Anglican Communion in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, largely in opposition to the ordination of openly homosexual bishops and other clergy are usually referred to as belonging to the [[Anglican realignment]] movement, or else as "orthodox" Anglicans.<ref name="A. McKinnon, pp.351-373"/> 

In some ways they represent a stronger opposition because they have the backing of many member provinces of the Anglican Communion and, in some cases, are or have been missionary jurisdictions of such provinces of the Communion as the Churches of Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, and the Southern Cone of America.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Such debates about social theology and ethics, have occurred at the same time as debates on prayer book revision and the acceptable grounds for achieving full communion with non-Anglican churches.<ref>Ward, Keith ''A Global History of Anglicanism'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2006).</ref>
