{{Numismatics}}

'''Coins''' are pieces of hard material  used primarily as a medium of exchange or [[legal tender]]. They are standardized in weight, and produced in large quantities in order to facilitate trade. They are most often issued by a government.

Coins are usually metal or [[alloy metal]], or sometimes made of synthetic materials. They are usually [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] shaped. Coins made of valuable metal are stored in large quantities as [[bullion coin]]s. Other coins are used as [[money]] in everyday transactions, circulating alongside [[banknote]]s: these coins are usually worth less than banknotes: usually the highest value coin in circulation (i.e. excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has occasionally been lower than the value of the metal they contain, for example due to [[inflation]]. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, or the general public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see [[Gresham's Law]]).

Exceptions to the rule of face value being higher than content value also occur for some bullion coins made of [[silver]] or [[gold]] (and, rarely, other metals, such as [[platinum]] or [[palladium]]), intended for collectors or investors in precious metals. Examples of modern gold collector/investor coins include the [[American Gold Eagle]] minted by the United States, the [[Canadian Gold Maple Leaf]] minted by Canada, and the [[Krugerrand]], minted by South Africa. The [[American Gold Eagle]] has a face value of US$50, and the [[Canadian Gold Maple Leaf]] coins also have nominal (purely symbolic) face values (e.g. C$50 for 1 oz.); but the [[Krugerrand]] does not.

Historically, a great quantity of [[coinage metals]] (including alloys) and other materials (e.g. [[porcelain]]) have been used to produce coins for circulation, collection, and metal investment: bullion coins often serve as more convenient stores of assured metal quantity and purity than other bullion.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tony Clayton |url=http://www.tclayton.demon.co.uk/metal.html |title=Comprehensive list of metals and their alloys which have been used at various times, in coins for all types of purposes |publisher=Tclayton.demon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref>

Today, the term coin can also be used in reference to digital currencies which are not issued by a state.  As of 2013, examples include BitCoin and LiteCoin, among others.

As coins have long been used as money, in some languages the same word is used for "coin" and "[[currency]]".

== History ==
The first coins developed in [[Iron Age Anatolia]] and [[Archaic Greece]] around 600 BC.
Coins spread rapidly in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, throughout [[Ancient Greek coinage|Greece]] and [[Achaemenid coinage|Persia]], and further to [[Illyrian coinage|the Balkans]] and [[Coinage of India|India]].
Standardized [[Roman currency]] was used throughout the [[Roman Empire]].
Important Roman [[gold coin|gold]] and [[silver coin|silver]] coins were continued into the Middle Ages (see [[Gold dinar]], [[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]], [[Aureus]], [[Denarius]]).
Ancient and early medieval coins in theory had the value of their metal content, although there have been many instances throughout history of the metal content of coins being debased, so that the inferior coins were worth less in metal than their face value. [[Fiat money]] first arose in medieval China, with the [[Jiaozi (currency)|jiaozi]] paper money. Early paper money was introduced in Europe in the later Middle Ages, but some coins continued to have the value of the gold or silver they contained throughout the [[Early Modern period]]. The [[penny]] was minted as a silver coin until the 17th century.
The first copper pennies were minted in the United States in the 1790s<ref>{{cite web|title=Cent|url=http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/circulatingCoins/?action=CircPenny|work=US Mint Website|publisher=US Mint|accessdate=11/12/13}}</ref> {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}. Silver content was reduced in many coins in the 19th century (use of [[Billon (alloy)|billon]]), and the first coins made entirely of [[base metal]] (e.g. [[nickel]], [[cupronickel]], [[aluminium bronze]]), representing values higher than the value of their metal, were minted in the mid 19th century.

=== Bronze Age predecessors ===
[[File:Copper Ingot Crete.jpg|thumb|An [[Oxhide ingot]] from [[Crete]]. [[Late Bronze Age]] metal ingots were given standard shapes, such as the shape of an "ox-hide", suggesting that they represented standardized values.]]
Coins were an evolution of "currency" systems of the [[Late Bronze Age]], where standard-sized [[ingot]]s, and tokens such as [[knife money]], were used to store and transfer value. In the late [[Chinese Bronze Age]], standardized cast tokens were made, such as those discovered in a tomb near [[Anyang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.big5.henan.gov.cn/hngk/system/2006/08/02/010000219.shtml |title=中國最早金屬鑄幣 商代晚期鑄造銅貝-河南概況 |publisher=Big5.henan.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RGu62yiVF8wC&pg=PT186&dq=shang+coin&lr=#PPT187,M1 |title=The Everything Coin Collecting Book: All You Need to Start Your Collection ...|first= Richard |last=Giedroyc|publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-11-15 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref> These were replicas in bronze of earlier Chinese money, [[cowrie]] shells, so they were named [[Tong Bei|Bronze Shell]].<ref>{{cite web|author=YK Kwan |url=http://chinesechinese.net/HistoryofChina.html |title=A snap shot view of The history of China by YK Kwan |publisher=Chinesechinese.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/focus/currency.htm |title=Shell Money before Qin Dynasty |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_681500371_2/shang_dynasty.html|title= Shang Dynasty Economy|work= Encarta|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257013886252294|archivedate= 2009-10-31}}</ref>

The earliest coins are mostly associated with [[Iron Age Anatolia]], especially with the kingdom of [[Lydia]].<ref>M. Kroll, review of G. Le Rider's ''La naissance de la monnaie'', ''Schweizerische Numismatische Rundschau'' '''80''' (2001), p. 526. D. Sear, Greek Coins and Their Values Vol. 2, Seaby, London, 1979, p. 317.</ref>
Early [[electrum]] coins were not standardized in weight, and in their earliest stage may have been ritual objects, such as badges or medals, issued by priests.<ref>"The Types of Greek Coins" An Archaeological Essay by Percy Gardner 1883 p.42 ''"Considering these and other facts it may be held to be probable, if not absolutely proved, that priests first issued stamped coin, and that the first mints were in Greek temples."'' [http://dln2.comyr.com/PDF/7682.pdf]</ref>
Many early Lydian and Greek coins were minted under the authority of private individuals and are thus more akin to tokens or badges than to modern coins,<ref>G. Hanfmann, pp. 73, 77. R. Seaford, p. 128, points out, "The nearly total lack of … coins in the excavated commercial-industrial areas of Sardis suggests that they were concentrated in the hands of the king and possibly wealthy merchants."</ref> though due to their numbers it is evident that some were official state issues, with [[Alyattes II|King Alyattes]] of Lydia being a frequently mentioned originator of coinage.<ref>A. Ramage, "Golden Sardis", King Croesus' Gold: Excavations at Sardis and the History of Gold Refining, edited by A. Ramage and P. Craddock, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2000, p. 18.</ref>

The first Lydian coins were made of [[electrum]], a naturally occurring alloy of silver and gold that was further alloyed with added silver and copper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html |title=A Case for the World's Oldest Coin: Lydian Lion |publisher=Rg.ancients.info |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>
Most of the early Lydian coins include no writing ("legend" or "inscription"), only an image of a symbolic animal. Therefore the dating of these coins relies primarily on archaeological evidence, with the most commonly cited evidence coming from excavations at the [[Temple of Artemis at Ephesus]], also called the Ephesian Artemision (which would later evolve into one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]). Because the oldest lion head "coins" were discovered in that temple, and they do not appear to have been used in commerce, these objects may not have been coins but badges or medals issued by the priests of that temple. Anatolian Artemis was the ''[[Potnia Theron|Πὀτνια Θηρῶν]]'' (Potnia Thêrôn, "Mistress of Animals"), whose symbol was the [[stag]].

A small percentage of early Lydian/Greek coins have a legend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/inscriptions.html |title=Inscriptions and Titles on ancient Greek coins |publisher=Snible.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref>
{{splitsection|Phanes coins|date=January 2013}}
A famous early electrum coin, the most ancient inscribed coin at present known, is from nearby [[Caria]]. This coin has a Greek legend reading ''phaenos emi sema'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/e/electrum_stater_inscribed_with.aspx |title=Electrum stater inscribed with the name of Phanes |publisher=British Museum |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref> interpreted variously as "I am the badge of Phanes", or "I am the sign of light",<ref>Newton (Num. Chron., 1870, p. 238</ref> or  "I am the tomb of light", or "I am the tomb of Phanes".
The coins of [[Phanes (coin issuer)|Phanes]] are known to be amongst the earliest of Greek coins, a [[hemihekte]] of the issue was found in the foundation deposit of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos (the oldest deposit of [[electrum]] coins discovered). One assumption is that Phanes was a wealthy merchant, another that this coin is associated with Apollo-[[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]] and, due to the [[Deer]], with [[Artemis]] (twin sister of the god of light [[Apollo]]-Phaneos). Although only seven Phanes type coins were discovered, it is also notable that 20% of all early [[electrum]] coins also have the lion of Artemis and the sun burst  of Apollo-Phaneos.
Alternatively, Phanes may have been the [[Halicarnassus|Halicarnassian]] mercenary of [[Amasis II|Amasis]] mentioned by [[Herodotus]], who escaped to the court of [[Cambyses]], and became his guide in the invasion of Egypt in 527 or 525 BC. According to Herodotus, this Phanes was buried alive by a sandstorm, together with 50,000 Persian soldiers, while trying to conquer the temple of [[Amun]]–[[Zeus]] in Egypt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/newnumismatic18royauoft/newnumismatic18royauoft_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "The numismatic chronicle and journal of the Royal Numismatic Society" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}. Herodotus third book (ch. iv.).</ref>  The fact that the Greek word "Phanes" also means light (or lamp), and the word "sema" also means tomb  makes this coin a famous and controversial one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/ionia.html#571 |title=Ancient coinage of Ionia |publisher=Snible.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref>

Another candidate for the site of the earliest coins is [[Aegina]], where  [[Chelone (Greek mythology)|Chelone]] ("turtle") coins  were first minted on 700 BC,<ref>British Museum Catalogue 11 - [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByKcmdYWS2bZWVpFLWRtVXd0Ulk/edit?pli=1 Attica Megaris Aegina], 700 - 550 BC, plate [http://www.snible.org/coins/bmc/attica/XXIII.jpg XXIII].</ref> either by the local Aegina people or by [[Pheidon]] king of [[Argos]] (who first set the standards of weights and measures).

Coins from  [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] appeared shortly thereafter, known to exist at least since the late 6th century BC.<ref>C. Kraay, Archaic and Classical Greek Coins, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1976.</ref>

Coins were minted in the [[Achaemenid Empire]], including the gold ''[[daric]]s'' and silver ''[[Siglos#Siglos|sigloi]]''.
and with the  Achemenid conquest of [[Gandhara]] under [[Darius the Great]] c. 520 BC, the practice spread to the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]. The coins of this period were   called ''Puranas'', ''Karshapanas'' or ''Pana''.<ref>See P.L. Gupta: ''Coins'', New Delhi, National Book Trust, 1996, Chapter II.</ref>
These earliest Indian coins, however, are unlike those circulated in Persia, which were derived from the Greek/Anatolian type; they not disk-shaped but rather stamped bars of metal, suggesting that the innovation of stamped currency was added to a pre-existing form of token currency which had already been present in the [[Mahajanapadas|Mahajanapada]] kingdoms of the [[Indian Iron Age]]. Mahajanapadas that minted their own coins included [[Gandhara]], [[Kuntala]], [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]], [[Panchala]], [[Shakya]],  [[Surasena]] and [[Surashtra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-gandhara.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Gandhara Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}} {{cite web|url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-kuntala.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Kuntala Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}} {{cite web|url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-kuru.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Kuru Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}} {{cite web|url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-panchala.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Panchala Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}} {{cite web|url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-shakya.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Shakya Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}} {{cite web|url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-shurasena.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Shurasena Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}} {{cite web|url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-surashtra.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Surashtra Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref>

=== As currency ===
{{Main|Currency}}
Most coins presently are made of a [[base metal]], and their value comes from their status as [[fiat money]]. This means that the value of the coin is decreed by government fiat (law), and thus is determined by the [[free market]] only inasmuch as national currencies are used in domestic trade and also traded internationally on [[foreign exchange market]]s. Thus these coins are monetary [[Token coin|tokens]], just as paper currency is: they are usually not backed by metal, but rather by some form of government guarantee. Some have suggested that such coins not be considered to be "true coins" (see below). Thus there is very little economic difference between notes and coins of equivalent face value.

Coins may be in circulation with fiat values lower than the value of their component metals, but they are never initially issued with such value, and the shortfall only arises over time due to [[inflation]], as market values for the metal overtake the fiat declared face value of the coin. Examples are the [[Coinage Act of 1965|pre-1965 US dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar]], [[Nickel (United States coin)|US nickel]], and [[Cent (United States coin)|pre-1982 US penny]]. As a result of the increase in the value of copper, the United States greatly reduced the amount of copper in each penny. Since mid-1982, United States pennies are made of 97.5% zinc, with the remaining 2.5% being a coating of copper. Extreme differences between fiat values and metal values of coins causes coins to be hoarded or removed from circulation by illicit smelters in order to realise the value of their metal content. This is an example of [[Gresham's Law]]. The [[United States Mint]], in an attempt to avoid this, implemented new interim rules on December 14, 2006, subject to public comment for 30 days, which criminalized the melting and export of pennies and nickels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmint.gov/pressroom/index.cfm?action=press_release&ID=724 |title=United States Mint Moves to Limit Exportation & Melting of Coins |publisher=The United States Mint |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref> Violators can be fined up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for up to five years.

=== As a collector's item ===
{{Main|Numismatics}}
A coin's value as a collector's item or as an investment generally depends on its condition, specific historical significance, rarity, quality/beauty of the design and general popularity with collectors. If a coin is greatly lacking in all of these, it is unlikely to be worth much. The value of bullion coins is also influenced to some extent by those factors, but is largely based on the value of their gold, silver, or platinum content. Sometimes non-monetized bullion coins such as the [[Canadian Maple Leaf]] and the [[American Gold Eagle]] are minted with nominal face values less than the value of the metal in them, but as such coins are never intended for circulation, these face values have no relevance.

=== As a medium of expression ===
Coins can be used as creative medium of expression – from fine art sculpture to the penny machines that can be found in most amusement parks. In the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in the United States there are some regulations specific to nickels and pennies that are informative on this topic. 31 CFR §&nbsp;82.1 forbids unauthorized persons from exporting, melting, or treating any 5 or 1 cent coins.

This has been a particular problem with nickels and dimes (and with some comparable coins in other currencies) because of their relatively low face value and unstable commodity prices. For a while the copper in US pennies was worth more than one cent, so people would hoard pennies then melt them down for their metal value. It costs more than face value to manufacture pennies or nickels, so any widespread loss of the coins in circulation could be expensive for the Treasury. This was more of a problem when coins were still made of precious metals like silver and gold, so historically strict laws against alteration make more sense.

31 CFR §&nbsp;82.2 goes on to state that: "(b) The prohibition contained in §&nbsp;82.1 against the treatment of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins shall not apply to the treatment of these coins for educational, amusement, novelty, jewelry, and similar purposes as long as the volumes treated and the nature of the treatment makes it clear that such treatment is not intended as a means by which to profit solely from the value of the metal content of the coins."

== Coin debasement ==
{{Main|Debasement}}

Throughout history, monarchs and governments have often created more coinage than their supply of precious metals would allow if the coins were pure metal. By replacing some fraction of a coin's precious metal content with a base metal (often [[copper]] or [[nickel]]), the intrinsic value of each individual coin was reduced (thereby ''"debasing"'' their money), allowing the coining authority to produce more coins than would otherwise be possible. Debasement occasionally occurs in order to make the coin harder and therefore less likely to be worn down as quickly, but the more usual reason is to profit from the difference between face value and metal value. Debasement of money almost always leads to price [[inflation]]. Sometimes [[price control]]s are at the same time also instituted by the governing authority, but historically these have generally proved unworkable.

The United States is unusual in that it has only slightly modified its coinage system (except for the images and symbols on the coins, which have changed a number of times) to accommodate two centuries of inflation. The one-cent coin has changed little since 1856 (though its composition was changed in 1982 to remove virtually all copper from the coin) and still remains in circulation, despite a greatly reduced purchasing power. On the other end of the spectrum, the largest coin in common circulation is 25 cents, a very low value for the largest denomination coin compared to many other countries. Recent increases in the prices of copper, nickel, and zinc mean that both the US one- and five-cent coins are now worth more for their raw metal content than their face (fiat) value. In particular, copper one-cent pieces (those dated prior to 1982 and some 1982-dated coins) now contain about two cents' worth of copper. Some denominations of circulating coins that were formerly minted in the United States are no longer made. These include coins with a face value of a half cent, two cents, three cents, and twenty cents. (The Half Dollar and Dollar coins are still produced, but mostly for vending machines and collectors.) The United States also used to coin the following denominations for circulation in gold: One dollar, $2.50, three dollars, five dollars, ten dollars, and twenty dollars. In addition, cents were originally slightly larger than the modern quarter and weighed nearly half an ounce, while five-cent coins (known then as "half dimes") were smaller than a dime and made of a silver alloy. Dollars were also much larger and weighed approximately an ounce.  One dollar gold coins are no longer produced and rarely used. The U.S. also has bullion and commemorative coins with the following denominations: 50¢, $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, and $100.

== Other uses ==
Some convicted criminals from the British Isles who were sentenced to transportation to Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries used coins to leave messages of remembrance to loved ones left behind in Britain. The coins were defaced, smoothed and inscribed, either by stippling or engraving, with sometimes touching words of loss. These coins were called "convict love tokens" or "leaden hearts".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/convict_tokens |title=Convict tokens, National Museum of Australia |publisher=Nma.gov.au |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref> A number of these tokens are in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].

Circulating coins commonly suffered from "shaving" or "clipping": the public would cut off small amounts of precious metal from their edges to form new coins.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Origin of Financial Crises |last=Cooper |first=George |year= 2008|publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-47345-5 |page=46 }}</ref> Unmilled British [[sterling silver]] coins were sometimes reduced to almost half their minted weight. This form of debasement in [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] England was commented on by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]], whose name was later attached to [[Gresham's Law]]. The monarch would have to periodically recall circulating coins, paying only the bullion value of the silver, and reminting them. This, also known as recoinage, is a long and difficult process that was done only occasionally.<ref>Denis R. Cooper ''The Art and Craft of Coinmaking. A History of Minting Technology''. London: Spink, 1988. ISBN 0-907605-27-3 p.47</ref> Many coins have milled or [[Reeding#Numismatics|reeded edges]], originally designed to make it easier to detect clipping.

The side of a coin carrying an image of a monarch or other authority, or a [[national emblem]], is sometimes called the ''[[obverse]]'', or colloquially, ''heads''; ''see also [[List of people on coins]]''. The other side, which may carry the denomination, is sometimes called the ''[[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]'', or colloquially, ''tails''. The year of [[mint (coin)|minting]] is usually shown on the obverse, although some [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] coins, most [[Canadian coinage|Canadian]] coins, the pre-2008 British [[Twenty pence (British decimal coin)|20p]] coin, and all Japanese coins, are exceptions.

In cases where a correctly oriented coin is flipped vertically to show the other side correctly oriented, the coin is said to have [[coin orientation]]. In cases where a coin is flipped horizontally to show the other side, it is said to have [[medallic orientation]]. While coins of the [[United States Dollar]] are coin orientated, those of the [[Euro]] and [[British Pound]] are medallic.

[[Bimetallic coins]] are sometimes used for higher values and for commemorative purposes. In the 1990s, France used a tri-metallic coin. Common circulating bimetallic examples include the [[1 euro coins|€1]], [[2 euro coins|€2]], [[Two pounds (British decimal coin)|British £2]] and [[Canadian 2 dollar coin|Canadian $2]].

The ''exergue'' is the space on a coin beneath the main design, often used to show the coin's date, although it is sometimes left blank or containing a [[mint mark]], [[privy mark]], or some other decorative or informative design feature. Many coins do not have an exergue at all, especially those with few or no legends, such as the Victorian bun penny.

Not all coins are round. The [[Fifty cent coin (Australian)|Australian 50 cent coin]], for example, has [[dodecagon|twelve flat sides]]. Some coins have wavy edges, e.g. the $2 and 20-cent coins of [[Coins of the Hong Kong dollar|Hong Kong]] and the 10 cent coins of Bahamas. Some are square-shaped, such as the 15 cent coin of the Bahamas. During the 1970s, [[Swaziland|Swazi]] coins were minted in several shapes, including squares, polygons, and wavy edged circles with 8 and 12 waves.

Some other coins, like the [[Fifty pence (British decimal coin)|British 20 and 50 pence coins]] and the Canadian [[Loonie]], have an odd number of sides, with the edges rounded off. This way the coin has a [[Curve of constant width|constant diameter]], recognisable by [[vending machine]]s whichever direction it is inserted.

A triangular coin with a face value of [[Five pounds (British coin)|£5]] (produced to commemorate the 2007/2008 [[Tutankhamun]] exhibition at [[The O2 Arena]]) was commissioned by the [[Isle of Man]]: it became legal tender on 6 December 2007.<ref>It is unlikely to be spent as it costs 15[[GBP]] to buy – article ''Pyramid coin a nightmare for pockets'', article by Gary</ref> Other triangular coins issued earlier include: [[Republic of Cabinda|Cabinda]] coin, [[Bermuda]] coin, 2 Dollar [[Cook Islands]] 1992 triangular coin, [[Uganda]] Millennium Coin and [[Poland|Polish]] Sterling-Silver 10-Zloty Coin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dig4coins.com/articles/other-coins/triangular-coins |title=Triangular Coins |publisher=Dig4coins.com |date=2007-09-12 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref>

Guitar-shaped coins were once issued in Somalia. Poland once issued a fan-shaped 10 złoty coin and the 2002 $10 coin from [[Nauru]], was Europe-shaped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/articles/unusualcoins.asp |title=Unusual coins|publisher=Fleur-de-coin.com |date=1912-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref>

Some mediaeval coins, called [[bracteate]]s, were so thin they were struck on only one side.

The [[Royal Canadian Mint]] is now able to produce holographic-effect gold and silver coinage. However this procedure is not limited to only bullion or commemorative coinage. The [[500 yen coin]] from Japan was subject to a massive amount of [[counterfeit]]ing. The Japanese government in response produced a circulatory coin with a holographic image.

The Royal Canadian Mint has also released several coins that are coloured, the first of which was in commemoration of Remembrance Day. The subject was a coloured poppy on the reverse of a 25 cent piece.

=== Flipping ===
{{Main|Coin flipping}}
Coins are popularly used as a sort of two-sided [[dice|die]]; in order to choose between two options with a random possibility, one choice will be labeled ''heads'' and the other ''tails'', and a coin will be flipped or tossed to see whether the heads or tails side comes up on top – see [[coin flipping]]. Mathematically, this is known as a [[Bernoulli trial]]: a fair coin is defined to have the probability of heads (in the parlance of Bernoulli trials, a "success") of exactly 0.5. Coins are sometimes falsified to make one side weigh more, in order to simulate a fair type of coin which is actually not fair. Such a coin is said to be weighted.

=== Spinning ===
{{further|Euler's Disk}}
Coins can also be spun on a flat surface such as a table. This results in the following phenomenon: as the coin falls over and rolls on its edge, it spins faster and faster (formally, the [[precession]] rate of the symmetry axis of the coin, i.e., the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an abrupt stop. This is mathematically modeled as a [[finite-time singularity]] – the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using [[high speed photography]] and devices such as [[Euler's Disk]]. The slowing down is predominantly caused by [[rolling friction]] (air resistance is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a [[power law]] with exponent approximately −1/3.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevE.66.045102}}</ref>
