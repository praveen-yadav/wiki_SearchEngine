'''Corrado Gini''' (May 23, 1884 &ndash; March 13, 1965) was an Italian [[statistician]], [[demography|demographer]] and [[sociology|sociologist]] who developed the [[Gini coefficient]], a measure of the [[income]] inequality in a [[society]]. Gini was also a leading [[fascism|fascist]] theorist and ideologue who wrote ''The Scientific Basis of Fascism'' in 1927. Gini was a proponent of [[organicism]] and applied it to nations.<ref name="pp40">Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA. Pp. 40.</ref>


Gini was born on May 23, 1884, in [[Motta di Livenza]], near [[Treviso]], into an old [[landed family]]. He entered the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Bologna]], where in addition to law he studied [[mathematics]], [[economics]], and [[biology]].

==Career==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
Gini's scientific work ran in two directions: towards the social sciences and towards statistics. His interests ranged well beyond the formal aspects of statistics—to the laws that govern biological and social phenomena.

His first published work was, ''Il sesso dal punto di vista statistico'' (1908). This work is a thorough review of the natal sex ratio, looking at past theories and at how new hypothesis fit the statistical data. In particular, it presents evidence that the tendency to produce one or the other sex of child is, to some extent, heritable.

In 1910, he acceded to the Chair of Statistics in the [[University of Cagliari]] and then at [[University of Padua|Padua]] in 1913.

He founded the statistical journal ''Metron'' in 1920, directing it until his death;  it only accepted articles with practical applications.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

He became a professor at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] in 1925. At the University, he founded a lecture course on [[sociology]], maintaining it until his retirement. He also set up the School of Statistics in 1928, and, in 1936, the Faculty of Statistical, Demographic and Actuarial Sciences.

In 1929, Gini founded the Italian Committee for the Study of Population Problems (''Comitato italiano per lo studio dei problemi della popolazione) '' which, two years later, organised the first Population Congress in Rome.

In 1926, he was appointed President of the [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Central Institute of Statistics]] in Rome. This he organised as a single centre for Italian statistical services. He resigned in 1932 in protest at interference in his work by the fascist state.

Milestones during the rest of his career include:
*In 1933 - vice president of the International Sociological Institute.
*In 1934 - president of the Italian [[Genetics]] and [[Eugenics]] Society.
*In 1935 - president of the International Federation of Eugenics Societies in Latin-language Countries.
*In 1937 - president of the Italian Sociological Society.
*In 1941 - president of the Italian Statistical Society.
*In 1957 - Gold Medal for outstanding service to the Italian School.
*In 1962 - National Member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].

==Italian Unionist Movement==
On October 12, 1944, Gini joined with the Sicilian activist [[Santi Paladino]], and fellow-statistician Ugo Damiani to found the [[Italian Unionist Movement]], for which the emblem was the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]], the [[Italian flag]] and a world map. According to the three men, the [[Government of the United States]] should annex all free and democratic nations worldwide, thereby transforming itself into a [[world government]], and allowing [[Washington DC]] to maintain Earth in a perpetual condition of [[peace]]. The party existed up to 1948 but had little success and its aims were not supported by the United States.

==Organicism and nations==
Gini was a proponent of [[organicism]] and saw nations as organic in nature.<ref name="pp40"/> Gini shared the view held by [[Oswald Spengler]] that populations go through a cycle of birth, growth, and decay.<ref name="pp40"/> Gini claimed that nations at a primitive level have a high [[birth rate]], but, as they evolve, the [[upper class]]es birth rate drops while the [[Working class|lower class]] birth rate, while higher, will inevitably deplete as their stronger members emigrate, die in war, or enter into the upper classes.<ref name="pp40"/> If a nation continues on this path without resistance, Gini claimed the nation would enter a final [[Decadence|decadent]] stage where the nation would degenerate as noted by decreasing birth rate, decreasing cultural output, and the lack of [[Imperialism|imperial]] conquest.<ref name="pp41">Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA. Pp. 41.</ref> At this point, the decadent nation with its aging population can be overrun by a more youthful and vigorous nation.<ref name="pp41"/> Gini's organicist theories of nations and natality are believed to have influenced policies of [[Italian Fascism]].<ref name="pp40"/>
