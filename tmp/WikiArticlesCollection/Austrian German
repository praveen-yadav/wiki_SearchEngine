'''Austrian German''' ({{lang-de|Österreichisches Deutsch}}), or '''Austrian Standard German''', is the national standard variety of the [[German language]] spoken in [[Austria]] and in the autonomous Province of [[South Tyrol]] ([[Italy]]). The standardized form of Austrian German for official texts and schools is defined by the [[Austrian Dictionary]] ({{lang-de|Österreichisches Wörterbuch}}), published under the authority of the Austrian [[Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture]].

== General situation of German language ==
As [[German language|German]] is a [[pluricentric language]], Austrian German is merely one among several [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of Standard German. Much like the relationship between [[British English]] and [[American English]], the Austrian and German varieties differ in minor respects (e.g., spelling, word usage and grammar) but are recognizably equivalent and largely mutually intelligible. The [[Österreichisches Wörterbuch|official Austrian dictionary]], "Das Österreichische Wörterbuch", gives grammar and spelling rules defining the official language. In addition to this standard variety, in everyday life most Austrians speak one of a number of [[Upper German languages|Upper German]] [[dialect]]s.

With German being a [[pluricentric language]], Austrian dialects should not be confused with the variety of [[Standard German]] spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of [[Germany]] or [[Switzerland]]. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in [[culinary]] terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and [[Administration (government)|administrative]] and [[law|legal]] language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German [[nation-state]] in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions. A comprehensive collection of Austrian-German legal, administrative and economic terms is offered in: ''Markhardt, Heidemarie: Wörterbuch der österreichischen Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsterminologie'' (Peter Lang, 2006).

===Former Standard (spoken)===
The "Former Standard", used for about 300 years or more in speech in refined language, was the "Schönbrunner Deutsch", a sociolect spoken by the imperial Habsburg Family and the nobility of [[Austria-Hungary]].  It differs from other dialects in vocabulary and pronunciation: it appears to be spoken slightly nasally. This was not a standard in a modern technical sense – it was the social standard of "upper class" speech.<ref>Here are some examples of Schönbrunner Deutsch:  
* "Crown Prince" Otto von Habsburg [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEIHAl01GP4 Otto von Habsburg - Quo vadis Integration - Festvortrag Eggenberg 2004]
* Emperor Charles I. of Austria (1916–1918) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMU9FFzez1A
* Emperor Franz Joseph (1848–1916) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jecUwMPk8pE&feature=related</ref>

===Special forms in written language===
For many years, Austria had a special form of the language for official government documents.  This form is known as: "Österreichische Kanzleisprache" or "Austrian chancellery language" in English.  It is a very traditional form of the language, probably derived from medieval deeds and documents, and has a very complicated structure and vocabulary which is generally reserved only for such documents.  For most speakers (even native speakers), this form of the language is generally difficult to understand, as it contains many highly specialised terms for diplomatic, internal, official, and military matters. There are no regional variations, because this special written form has mainly been used by a government that has now for centuries been based in Vienna. "Österreichische Kanzleisprache" is now used less and less, thanks to various administrative reforms which have led to there being fewer of the classic civil servants, the [[Beamter]]. As a result, Standard German is replacing it in government and administrative texts.

=== European Union ===
When Austria became a member of the [[European Union]], the Austrian variety of the German language — limited to 23 agricultural terms — was "protected" in Protocol No 10, regarding the use of specific Austrian terms of the German language in the framework of the European Union, which forms part of the Austrian EU accession treaty.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11994N/htm/11994N.html#0370010045 | title = DOCUMENTS concerning the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Norway to the European Union | accessdate = 2011-01-27 | date = 1994-08-29 | work = European Commission | quote = The specific Austrian terms of the German language contained in the Austrian legal order and listed in the Annex to this Protocol shall have the same status and may be used with the same legal effect as the corresponding terms used in Germany listed in that Annex.}}</ref> Austrian German is the only variety of a [[pluricentric language]] recognized under international law / EU primary law. All facts concerning “Protocol no. 10” are documented in Markhardt, Heidemarie: “Das österreichische Deutsch im Rahmen der EU,” Peter Lang, 2005.

=== Grammar ===

====Verbs====
In [[Austria]], as in the [[German language|German]]-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]] and in southern [[Germany]], verbs that express a state tend to use ''sein'' as the [[auxiliary verb]] in the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], as well as verbs of movement. [[Verbs]] which fall into this category include ''sitzen'' (to sit), ''liegen'' (to lie) and, in parts of Carinthia, ''schlafen'' (to sleep). Therefore the perfect of these verbs would be ''ich bin gesessen'', ''ich bin gelegen'' and ''ich bin geschlafen'' respectively (note: ''ich bin geschlafen'' is a rarely used form, more commonly ''ich habe geschlafen'' is used; however ''ich bin eingeschlafen'' [I fell asleep] is not uncommon).  
In the variant of German that is spoken in Germany, the words ''stehen'' (to stand) and ''gestehen'' (to confess) are identical in the present perfect: ''habe gestanden''.  The Austrian variant avoids this potential ambiguity (''bin gestanden''  from ''stehen'', "to stand"; and ''habe gestanden'' from ''gestehen'', "to confess"). 

In addition, the [[preterite]] ([[simple past]]) is very rarely used in Austria, especially in the [[spoken language]], with the exception of some modal verbs (i.e. ''ich sollte'', ''ich wollte'').

=== Vocabulary ===
There are many official terms that differ in Austrian German from their usage in most parts of [[Germany]]. Words primarily used in Austria are '''Jänner''' (January) rather than ''Januar'',  '''heuer''' (this year) rather than ''dieses Jahr'', '''Stiege''' (stairs) instead of ''Treppe'', '''Rauchfang''' (chimney) instead of ''Schornstein'', many administrative, legal and political terms – and a whole series of foods and vegetables such as: '''Erdäpfel''' (potatoes) German ''Kartoffeln'' (but Dutch ''Aardappel''), '''Schlagobers''' (whipped cream) German ''Schlagsahne'', '''Faschiertes''' (ground beef) German ''Hackfleisch'', '''Fisolen''' (green beans) German ''Gartenbohne'' (but Czech ''fazole'' and Italian ''fagioli''), '''Karfiol''' (cauliflower) German ''Blumenkohl'' (but Hungarian ''Karfiol'', Slovak ''karfiol'' and Italian ''cavolfiore''), '''Kohlsprossen''' (Brussels sprouts) German ''Rosenkohl'', '''Marillen''' (apricots) German ''Aprikosen'' but Slovak ''marhuľa'' and Slovenian ''marelice'', '''Paradeiser''' (tomatoes) German ''Tomaten'' (but Hungarian ''paradicsom'' Slovak ''paradajka'' and Slovenian ''paradižnik''), '''Palatschinken''' (pancakes) German ''Pfannkuchen'' (but Czech ''palačinky'', Hungarian ''palacsinta''), '''Topfen''' (a semi-sweet cottage cheese) German ''Quark'' and '''Kren''' (horseradish) German ''Meerrettich'' (but Czech ''křen'').<ref>Otto Back, Erich Benedikt, Karl Blüml, et al.: Österreichisches Wörterbuch  (neue Rechtschreibung). Herausgegeben im Auftrag des Bundesministeriums für Unterricht, Kunst und Kultur. Auf der Grundlage des amtlichen Regelwerks. 41. circulation, Österreichischer Bundesverlag, Wien 2009, ISBN 978-3-209-06875-0</ref>

There are, however, some [[false friends]] between the two languages:
* '''Kasten''' (wardrobe) instead of ''Schrank'' – as opposed to '''Kiste''' (box) instead of '''Kasten''' (''Kiste'' in Germany means both box and kist).
* '''Sessel''' (chair) instead of ''Stuhl'' – whereas ''Sessel'' means easy chair in Germany and ''Stuhl'' means stool (feces) in both varieties
* '''Vorzimmer''' (hall[way]) instead of ''Diele'' – whereas ''Vorzimmer'' means [[antechamber]] in Germany
* '''Ofen''' (oven) instead of ''Kamin'' – whereas ''Kamin'' means ''Schornstein'' in Germany

==Dialects==

=== Classification ===
* Dialects of the [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian group]], which also comprises the dialects of German [[Bavaria]]
** [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] (along the main rivers [[Isar]] and [[Danube]], spoken in  the northern parts of the [[Salzburg (state)|State of Salzburg]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], and the Northern [[Burgenland]])
***[[Viennese German]]
** [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] (in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[South Tyrol]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], and the southern parts of Salzburg and Burgenland).
* [[Vorarlbergerisch]], spoken in [[Vorarlberg]], is a [[High Alemannic]] dialect.

=== Intercomprehensibility and regional accents ===
While strong forms of the various dialects are not normally fully comprehensible to Northern [[German people|Germans]], communication is much easier in [[Bavaria]], especially rural areas, where Bavarian dialect still predominates as the mother tongue. The [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] dialects are more intelligible to speakers of [[Standard German]] than the [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] dialects of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]. [[Viennese language|Viennese]], the Austro-Bavarian dialect of [[Vienna]], is most frequently used in [[Germany]] for impersonations of the typical inhabitant of Austria. The people of [[Graz]], the capital of [[Styria]], speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, for example from western [[Styria]].

Simple words in the various dialects are very similar, but pronunciation is distinct for each and, after listening to a few spoken words it may be possible for an Austrian to realise which [[dialect]] is being spoken. However, in regard to the dialects of the deeper valleys of the [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], other Tyroleans are often unable to understand them. Speakers from the different [[states of Austria]] can easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents (probably more so than Bavarians), those of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], [[Vienna]], [[Upper Austria]], and the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] being very characteristic. Speakers from those regions, even those speaking [[Standard German]], can usually be easily identified by their accent, even by an untrained listener. 

Several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non-Germanic linguistic groups, such as the dialect of Carinthia, where in the past many speakers were bilingual with [[Slovene language|Slovene]], and the dialect of Vienna, which has been influenced by immigration during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] period, particularly from what is today the [[Czech Republic]]. The German dialects of [[South Tyrol]] have been influenced by local [[Romance languages]], in particular with many [[loan words]] from [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Ladin language|Ladin]].

Interestingly, the geographic borderlines between the different accents ([[isogloss]]es) coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border with [[Bavaria]], with Bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the similarities in the language.
