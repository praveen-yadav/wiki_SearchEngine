'''Chinese input methods''' are methods that allow a computer user to input [[Chinese characters]] with a standard [[ASCII]] keyboard. Most, if not all, Chinese [[input method]]s fall into one of two categories: phonetic readings or root shapes. Methods under the phonetic category usually are easier to learn but are less efficient, thus resulting in slower typing speeds because they typically require users to choose from a list of phonetically similar characters for input; whereas methods under the root shape category allow very precise and speedy input but have a difficult [[learning curve]] because they often require a thorough understanding of a character's strokes and composition.

Other methods allow users to write characters directly onto touchscreens, such as those found on mobile phones and tablet computers.

==History==
[[Image:Large chinese keyboard.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An early experimental Chinese keyboard with many keys was developed by researchers of [[National Chiao Tung University]] in Taiwan, but it never came to the mainstream.]]
Chinese input methods predate the computer. One of the early attempts was an electro-mechanical [[Chinese typewriter]] '''Ming kwai''' ({{zh|c=明快 |p=míngkuài |w=ming-k'uai}}) which was invented by [[Lin Yutang]], a prominent Chinese writer, in the 1940s.  It assigned thirty base shapes or strokes to different keys and adopted a new way of categorizing Chinese characters. But the typewriter was not produced commercially and Lin soon found himself deeply in debt.<ref>[http://203.68.20.65/science/content/1972/00110035/0018.htm 中文與計算機]</ref>

Before the 1980s, Chinese publishers hired teams of workers and selected a few thousand type pieces from an enormous Chinese character set. Chinese government agencies entered characters using a long, complicated list of [[Chinese telegraph code]]s, which assigned different numbers to each character. During the early computer era, Chinese characters were categorized by their radicals or Pinyin romanization, but results were less than satisfactory.

[[Chu Bong-Foo]] invented a common input method in 1976 with his [[Cangjie input method]], which assigns different "roots" to each key on a standard computer keyboard. With this method, for example, the character 日 is assigned to the A key, and 月 is assigned to B. Typing them together will result in the character 明 ("bright").

Despite its steeper learning curve, this method remains popular in Chinese communities that use [[traditional Chinese character]]s, such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]; the method allows very precise input, thus allowing users to type more efficiently and quickly, provided they are familiar with the fairly complicated rules of the method. It was the first method that allowed users to enter more than a hundred Chinese characters per minute.

All methods have their strengths and weaknesses. The [[pinyin method]] can be learned rapidly but its maximum input rate is limited. The ''[[Wubi method|Wubi]]'' takes longer to learn, but expert typists can enter text much more rapidly with it than with phonetic methods.

Due to these complexities, there is no "standard" method.

In mainland China, the [[Wubi method|wubi]] (shape-based) and pinyin methods such as [[Sogou Pinyin]] and [[Google Pinyin]] are the most popular; in [[Taiwan]], [[Boshiamy method|Boshiamy]], [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]], and [[Bopomofo|zhuyin]] predominate; and in [[Hong Kong]], the [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]] is most often taught in schools.

Other methods include [[handwriting recognition]], [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] and [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]]. The computer itself must first be "trained" before the first or second of these methods are used; that is, the new user enters the system in a special "learning mode" so that the system can learn to identify his handwriting or speech patterns. The latter two methods are used less frequently than keyboard-based input methods and suffer from relatively high error rates, especially when used without proper "training", though higher error rates are an acceptable trade-off to many users.

== Categories ==

===Phonetic-based===
{{See also|Pinyin input method}}
The user enters pronunciations that are converted into relevant Chinese characters. The user must select the desired character from homophones, which are common in Chinese. Modern systems, such as [[Sogou Pinyin]] and [[Google Pinyin]], predict the desired characters based on context and user preferences. For example, if one enters the sounds ''jicheng'', the software will type 繼承 (to inherit), but if ''jichengche'' is entered,  計程車 (taxi) will appear.

Various Chinese dialects complicate the system. Phonetic methods are based on standard [[pinyin]], [[Zhùyīn fúhào|Zhuyin]], and [[Jyutping]] in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, respectively.

While the phonetic system is easy to learn, choosing appropriate Chinese characters slows typing speed. Most users report a typing speed of fifty characters per minute, though some reach over one hundred per minute.<ref>[http://bbs.sogou.com/284579/goYBXy1sJXqFBAAAA.html users' Report on Pinyin Method], Sougou BBS</ref>
