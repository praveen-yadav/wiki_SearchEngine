The '''Black Sea''' is a [[sea]] in south-eastern Europe. It is bounded by [[Europe]], [[Anatolia]] and the [[Caucasus]] and is ultimately connected to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] Seas and various [[strait]]s. The [[Bosphorus]] Strait connects it to the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the Strait of the [[Dardanelles]] connects that sea to the Aegean Sea region of the Mediterranean. These waters separate [[eastern Europe]] and [[western Asia]]. The Black Sea is also connected to the [[Sea of Azov]] by the [[Strait of Kerch]].

The Black Sea has an area of {{convert|436400|km2|abbr=on}} (not including the Sea of Azov),<ref>Surface Area—{{cite web|title=Black Sea Geography |work=University of Delaware College of Marine Studies |url=http://www.ocean.udel.edu/blacksea/geography/index.html|year=2003|accessdate=December 2, 2006}}</ref> a maximum depth of {{convert|2212|m|abbr=on}},<ref>Maximum Depth—{{cite web|title=Europa – Gateway of the European Union Website|work=Environment and Enlargement – The Black Sea: Facts and Figures |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/enlarg/blackseafactsfigures_en.htm}}</ref> and a volume of {{Convert|547000|km3|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Unexpected changes in the oxic/anoxic interface in the Black Sea |work=Nature Publishing Group |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v338/n6214/abs/338411a0.html|date=March 30, 1989|accessdate=December 2, 2006}}</ref> The Black Sea forms in an east-west trending elliptical depression which lies between [[Bulgaria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], and [[Ukraine]].<ref name="UNEP2001">{{cite web|title=Socio-economic indicators for the countries of the Black Sea basin|year=2001|author=UNEP/GRID-Arendal Maps and Graphics Library|authorlink=United Nations Environment Programme|url=http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/sosio_economic_indicators_for_the_countries_of_the_black_sea_basin_giwa|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref> It is constrained by the [[Pontic Mountains]] to the south and by the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about {{convert|1,175|km|abbr=on}}.

Important cities along the coast include [[Batumi]], [[Burgas]], [[Constanța]], [[Giresun]], [[Hopa]], [[Istanbul]], [[Kerch]], [[Mangalia]], [[Năvodari]], [[Novorossiysk]], [[Odessa]], [[Ordu]], [[Poti]], [[Rize]], [[Samsun]], [[Sevastopol]], [[Sochi]], [[Sukhumi]], [[Trabzon]], [[Varna]], [[Yalta]] and [[Zonguldak]].

The Black Sea has a positive [[water balance]]; that is, a net outflow of water {{convert|300|km3|abbr=on}} per year through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the Aegean Sea. Mediterranean water flows into the Black Sea as part of a two-way hydrological exchange. The Black Sea outflow is cooler and less [[saline water|saline]], and floats over the warm, more saline Mediterranean inflow – as a result of differences in density caused by differences in salinity – leading to a significant [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] layer well below the surface waters. The Black Sea also receives river water from large [[Eurasia]]n [[fluvial]] systems to the north of the Sea, of which the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Dnieper]] and [[Danube]] are the most significant.

In the past, the water level has varied significantly. Due to these variations in the water level in the basin, the surrounding shelf and associated aprons have sometimes been land. At certain critical water levels it is possible for connections with surrounding water bodies to become established. It is through the most active of these connective routes, the [[Turkish Straits]], that the Black Sea joins the [[world ocean]]. When this hydrological link is not present, the Black Sea is a [[lake]], operating independently of the global ocean system. Currently the Black Sea water level is relatively high, thus water is being exchanged with the [[Mediterranean]]. The Turkish Straits connect the Black Sea with the Aegean Sea, and comprise the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles.

Such names have not yet been shown conclusively to predate the 12th&nbsp;century, but there are indications that they may be considerably older.

In Greece, the historical name "Euxine Sea", which holds a different meaning (see below), is still widely used:
 
* [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Efxinos Pontos'' (Eύξεινος Πόντος)

The Black Sea is one of four seas named in English after common [[color term]]s—the others being the [[Red Sea]], the [[White Sea]] and the [[Yellow Sea]].

===Historical names===
[[Strabo]]'s Geography (1.2.10) reports that in antiquity, the Black Sea was often just called "the Sea" ({{lang|lat|''ho pontos''}}). For the most part, Graeco-Roman tradition refers to the Black Sea as the "Hospitable sea", {{lang|lat|''Euxeinos Pontos''}} ({{lang|grc|Εὔξεινος Πόντος}}). This is a [[euphemism]] replacing an earlier "Inhospitable Sea", {{lang|lat|''Pontos Axeinos''}}, first attested in [[Pindar]] ([[circa|c.]]475&nbsp;BC). 

Strabo (7.3.6) thinks that the Black Sea was called "inhospitable" before Greek colonization because it was difficult to navigate, and because its shores were inhabited by savage tribes. The name was changed to "hospitable" after the [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesians]] had colonized the southern shoreline, the [[Pontus]], making it part of Greek civilization.

It is also possible that the name ''Axeinos'' arose by [[Folk etymology|popular etymology]] from a [[Scythian language|Scythian]] word {{lang|ira|''axšaina-''}} "unlit", "dark"; the designation "Black Sea" may thus date from [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]].

A map of Asia dating to 1570, entitled "Asiae Nova Descriptio", from [[Abraham Ortelius]]'s ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', labels the sea ''Mar Maggior'' ("Great Sea", cf. Latin {{lang|lat|''mare major''}}).

English-language writers of the 18th century often used the name "Euxine Sea" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|k|s|ɨ|n}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|k|ˌ|s|aɪ|n}}) to refer to the Black Sea. [[Edward Gibbon]], for instance, calls the sea by this name throughout ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''.<ref>Gibbon, Edward.

Near the Black Sea is situated the [[Black Sea Region]], well known by its "Chernozem belt" (black soil belt).  The Chernozem belt goes from Northern Serbia, northern Bulgaria (Danubian Plain) and southern Romania (Wallachian Plain), to northeast Ukraine across the Black Earth Region and southern Russia into Siberia.<ref>[http://bs-agro.com/index.php/about-us Agriculture in the Black Sea Region]</ref>

==Hydrology and hydrochemistry==
[[File:The Danube Spills into the Black Sea.jpg|thumb|350px|This [[SeaWiFS]] view reveals the colourful interplay of currents on the sea’s surface.]]

The Black Sea is the world’s largest [[meromictic]] basin where the deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of [[water]] that receive [[oxygen]] from the atmosphere. As a result, over 90% of the deeper Black Sea volume is [[anoxic waters|anoxic water]]. The current hydrochemical configuration is primarily controlled by basin topography and [[fluvial]] inputs, which result in a strongly stratified vertical structure and a positive water balance. 

The upper layers are generally cooler, less dense and less salty than the deeper waters, as they are fed by large fluvial systems, whereas the deep waters originate from the warm, salty waters of the Mediterranean. This influx of dense water from Mediterranean is balanced by an outflow of fresher Black Sea surface-water into the [[Marmara Sea]], maintaining the stratification and [[salinity]] levels.

The surface water has an average salinity of 18.0–18.5[[per mil|‰]] or [[Gram per litre|g/L]] (compared to 30–40‰ in the oceans) and contains oxygen and other nutrients required to sustain biotic activity. These waters circulate in a basin-wide [[cyclonic]] [[shelf break|shelfbreak]] [[gyre]] known as the Rim Current which transports water round the perimeter of the Black Sea. Within this feature, two smaller cyclonic gyres operate, occupying the eastern and western sectors of the basin. 

Outside of the Rim Current, numerous quasi-permanent coastal eddies are formed as a result of [[upwelling]] around the coastal apron and ‘wind curl’ mechanisms. The intra-annual strength of these features is controlled by seasonal atmospheric and fluvial variations. The temperature of the surface waters varies seasonally from {{convert|-1|to|28|°C|°F}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Directly beneath the surface waters the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL) is found. This layer is composed of cool, salty surface waters, which are the result of localised atmospheric cooling and decreased fluvial input during the winter months. The production of this water is focused in the centre of the major gyres and on the NW shelf and as the water is not dense enough to penetrate the deep waters, [[isopycnal]] [[advection]] occurs, dispersing the water across the entire basin. The base of the CIL is marked by a major [[thermocline]], [[halocline]] and [[pycnocline]] at about {{convert|100|–|200|m|abbr=on}} and this density disparity is the major mechanism for isolation of the deep water.

Below the pycnocline, salinity increases to 22.0–22.5‰ and temperatures rise to around {{convert|8.5|°C}}. The hydrochemical environment shifts from oxygenated to anoxic, as bacterial decomposition of sunken biomass utilises all of the free oxygen. Certain species of [[extremophile]] bacteria are capable of using [[sulfate]] ({{chem|SO|4}}<sup>2</sup>) in the [[redox|oxidation]] of [[organic material]], which leads to the creation of [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}). This enables the [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of [[sulfide]]s such as the [[iron sulphide]]s [[pyrite]], and [[mackinawite]], as well as the dissolution of carbonate matter such as [[calcium carbonate]] ({{chem|Ca|CO|3}}), found in shells. 

Organic matter, including [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] artifacts such as boat hulls, are well preserved. During periods of high surface productivity, short-lived [[algae|algal]] blooms form organic rich layers known as [[sapropel]]s. Scientists have reported an annual [[phytoplankton]] bloom that can be seen in many NASA images of the region.<ref>[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=3669 Black Sea Becomes Turquoise]{{dead link|date=March 2013}} earthobservatory.nasa.gov. Retrieved 2 December 2006.</ref> As a result of these characteristics the Black Sea has gained interest from the field of [[marine archaeology]] as ancient shipwrecks in excellent states of preservation have been discovered, such as the [[Byzantine]] wreck [[Sinop D]], located in the anoxic layer off the coast of [[Sinop, Turkey]].

Modelling shows the release of the [[hydrogen sulphide]] clouds in the event of an [[asteroid impact]] into the Black Sea would pose a threat to health—or even life—for people living on the Black Sea coast.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11069-006-0017-7|title=Asteroid impact in the Black Sea.

The Black Sea supports an active and dynamic marine ecosystem, dominated by species suited to the [[brackish]], nutrient-rich, conditions. As with all marine food webs, the Black Sea features a range of [[Trophic level|trophic]] groups, with [[autotrophic]] algae, including [[diatoms]] and [[dinoflagellates]], acting as primary producers. The fluvial systems draining Eurasia and central Europe introduce large volumes of sediment and dissolved nutrients into the Black Sea, but distribution of these nutrients is controlled by the degree of physiochemical stratification, which is, in turn, dictated by seasonal physiographic development.<ref name="Oguz99">{{cite journal|author=Oguz, T., H.

Dinkel, ''et al.''|year=2002|title=Benthic Nutrient Cycling and Diagenetic Pathways in the North-western Black Sea|doi=10.1006/ecss.2000.0653 |url=http://epic.awi.de/Publications/Fri2002d.pdf|journal=Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science|volume=54|issue=3|pages=369–383|bibcode=2002ECSS...54..369F}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

===Phytoplankton===
[[File:Black Sea Nasa May 25 2004.jpg|thumb|350px|Phytoplankton blooms and plumes of sediment form the bright blue swirls that ring the Black Sea in this 2004 image.]]

The main phytoplankton groups present in the Black Sea are [[dinoflagellates]], [[diatoms]], [[coccolithophores]] and [[cyanobacteria]]. Generally, the annual cycle of phytoplankton development comprises significant diatom and dinoflagellate-dominated spring production, followed by a weaker mixed assemblage of community development below the seasonal thermocline during summer months and a surface-intensified autumn production.<ref name=Oguz/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Eker, E., L. Georgieva, ''et al.''|year=1999|title=Phytoplankton distribution in the western and eastern Black Sea in spring and autumn 1995|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|volume= 56|pages=15–22|url=http://www.ims.metu.edu.tr/cv/kideys/EkerICES.pdf|doi=10.1006/jmsc.1999.0604}}</ref>  This pattern of productivity is also augmented by an ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'' bloom during the late spring and summer months.

*[[Dinoflagellates]]
: Annual dinoflagellate distribution is defined by an extended bloom period in subsurface waters during the late spring and summer. In November, subsurface plankton production is combined with surface production, due to vertical mixing of water masses and nutrients such as [[nitrite]].<ref name="Oguz99"/>  The major bloom-forming dinoflagellate species in the Black Sea is ''[[Gymnodinium]]'' sp.<ref name="Eker-Develi, E 2003">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0924-7963(03)00031-9|bibcode=2003JMS....39..203E|title=Distribution of phytoplankton in the southern Black Sea in summer 1996, spring and autumn 1998|year=2003|last1=Eker-Develi|first1=E|journal=Journal of Marine Systems|volume=39|issue=3–4|pages=203–211}}</ref> Estimates of dinoflagellate diversity in the Black Sea range from 193<ref>Krakhmalny, A.

It is also possible that the low winter temperatures below {{convert|4|°C}} of the Black Sea prevent [[thermophilous]] species from becoming established. The relatively high organic matter content of Black Sea surface water favour the development of [[heterotrophic]] (an organism which uses organic carbon for growth) and mixotrophic dinoflagellates species (able to exploit different trophic pathways), relative to autotrophs. Despite its unique hydrographic setting, there are no confirmed [[endemism|endemic]] dinoflagellate species in the Black Sea.<ref name=Gomez/>
*[[Diatoms]]
:The Black Sea is populated by many species of marine diatom, which commonly exist as colonies of [[unicellular]], non-motile auto- and [[heterotrophic]] [[algae]]. The life-cycle of most diatoms can be described as 'boom and bust' and the Black Sea is no exception, with diatom blooms occurring in surface waters throughout the year, most reliably during March.<ref name="Oguz99"/>  In simple terms, the phase of rapid population growth in diatoms is caused by the in-wash of [[silicon]]-bearing terrestrial sediments, and when the supply of silicon is exhausted, the diatoms begin to sink out of the photic zone and produce resting [[cysts]]. Additional factors such as predation by zooplankton and [[ammonium]]-based regenerated production also have a role to play in the annual diatom cycle.<ref name="Oguz99"/><ref name=Oguz/> Typically, {{lang|lat|''Proboscia alata''}} blooms during spring and {{lang|lat|''Pseudosolenia calcar-avis''}} blooms during the autumn.<ref name="Eker-Develi, E 2003"/>
* [[Coccolithophores]]
: Coccolithophores are a type of [[Motility|motile]], [[autotrophic]] [[phytoplankton]] that produce CaCO<sub>3</sub> plates, known as [[coccoliths]], as part of their life cycle. In the Black Sea, the main period of [[coccolithophore]] growth occurs after the bulk of the dinoflagellate growth has taken place. In May, the dinoflagellates move below the seasonal [[thermocline]], into deeper waters, where more nutrients are available. This permits coccolithophores to utilise the nutrients in the upper waters, and by the end of May, with favourable light and temperature conditions, growth rates reach their highest. The major bloom forming species is {{lang|lat|''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]''}}, which is also responsible for the release of [[dimethyl sulfide]] into the atmosphere. Overall, coccolithophore diversity is low in the Black Sea, and although recent sediments are dominated by {{lang|lat|''E. huxleyi''}}, {{lang|lat|''Braarudosphaera bigelowii''}}, [[Holocene]] sediments have also been shown to contain Helicopondosphaera and Discolithina species.
*[[Cyanobacteria]]
: Cyanobacteria are a phylum of [[picoplankton]]ic (plankton ranging in size from 0.2 to 2.0 [[micrometre|µm]]) [[bacteria]] that obtain their energy via [[photosynthesis]], and are present throughout the world's oceans. They exhibit a range of morphologiies, including filamentous colonies and [[biofilms]]. In the Black Sea, several species are present, and as an example, ''Synechococcus'' spp. can be found throughout the photic zone, although concentration decreases with increasing depth. Other factors which exert an influence on distribution include nutrient availability, predation and salinity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Vertical distribution of marine cyanobacteria Synechococcus spp. in the Black, Marmara, Aegean, and eastern Mediterranean seas|doi=10.1016/j.dsr2.2006.03.016|year=2006|last1=Uysal|first1=Z|journal=Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography|volume=53|issue=17–19|pages=1976–1987|bibcode=2006DSR....53.1976U}}</ref>

===Endemic animal species===
*[[Zebra mussel]]
: The Black Sea along with the [[Caspian Sea]] is part of the Zebra mussel's native range. The mussel has been accidentally introduced around the world and become an [[invasive species]] where it has been introduced.
*[[Common Carp]]
: The Common Carp's native range extends to The Black Sea along with the Caspian Sea and [[Aral Sea]]. Like the Zebra mussel the Common Carp is an invasive species when introduced to other habitats.
*[[Round Goby]]
: Is another native fish that is also found in the Caspian Sea. It preys upon Zebra mussels. Like the mussels and common carp it has become invasive when introduced to other environments, like the [[Great Lakes]].

===Effect of pollution ecology===
Since the 1960s, rapid industrial expansion along the Black Sea coast line and the construction of a major dam has significantly increased annual variability in the N:P:Si ratio in the basin. In coastal areas, the biological effect of these changes has been an increase in the frequency of monospecific phytoplankton blooms, with diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 2.5 and non-diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 6. The non-diatoms, such as the prymnesiophytes {{lang|lat|''Emiliania huxleyi''}} (coccolithophore), {{lang|lat|''Chromulina''}} sp., and the Euglenophyte {{lang|lat|''Eutreptia lanowii''}} are able to out-compete diatom species because of the limited availability of Si, a necessary constituent of diatom frustules.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Effect of Danube River dam on Black Sea biogeochemistry and ecosystem structure|doi=10.1038/386385a0|year=1997|last1=Humborg|first1=Christoph|last2=Ittekkot|first2=Venugopalan|last3=Cociasu|first3=Adriana|last4=Bodungen|first4=Bodo v.|journal=Nature|volume=386|issue=6623|pages=385–388|bibcode=1997Natur.386..385H}}</ref> As a consequence of these blooms, benthic macrophyte populations were deprived of light, while anoxia caused mass mortality in marine animals.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sburlea, A., L.

The decline in macrophytes was further compounded by overfishing during the 1970s, while the invasive ctenophore ''Mnemiopsis'' reduced the biomass of copepods and other zooplankton in the late 1980s. Additionally, an alien species—the [[warty comb jelly]] ({{lang|lat|''Mnemiopsis leidyi''}})—was able to establish itself in the basin, exploding from a few individuals to an estimated biomass of one billion metric tons.<ref>{{cite book|author=Colin Woodard|title=Ocean's end: travels through endangered seas|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QsVeUi_XbF4C&pg=PA1|accessdate=1 August 2011|date=11 February 2001|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-01571-9|pages=1–28}}</ref> The change in species composition in Black Sea waters also has consequences for hydrochemistry, as Ca-producing coccolithophores influence salinity and pH, although these ramifications have yet to be fully quantified. In central Black Sea waters, Si levels were also significantly reduced, due to a decrease in the flux of Si associated with advection across isopycnal surfaces. This phenomenon demonstrates the potential for localised alterations in Black Sea nutrient input to have basin-wide effects.

Pollution reduction and regulation efforts have led to a partial recovery of the Black Sea ecosystem during the 1990s, and an EU monitoring exercise, 'EROS21', revealed decreased N and P values, relative to the 1989 peak.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/ecss.2000.0659|url=http://www.physoz.icbm.de/download/sebastian/ECSS_lsebs.pdf|title=Modelling the Danube-influenced North-western Continental Shelf of the Black Sea.

==Climate==
Short-term climatic variation in the Black Sea region is significantly influenced by the operation of the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]], the climatic mechanisms resulting from the interaction between the north Atlantic and mid-latitude air masses.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.269.5224.676|title=Decadal Trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation: Regional Temperatures and Precipitation|year=1995|last1=Hurrell|first1=J.

== History ==

=== Mediterranean connection during the Holocene ===
[[File:Istambul and Bosporus big.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Bosphorus, taken from the [[International Space Station]]]]
[[File:Dardanelles map2.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Dardanelles]]

The Black Sea is connected to the [[World Ocean]] by a chain of two shallow straits, the [[Dardanelles]] and the Bosphorus. The Dardanelles is {{convert|55|m|abbr=on}} deep and the Bosphorus is as shallow as {{convert|36|m|abbr=on}}. By comparison, at the height of the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]], sea levels were more than {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} lower than they are now. 

There is also evidence that water levels in the Black Sea were considerably lower at some point during the post-glacial period. Thus, for example, archaeologists found fresh-water snail shells and man-made structures in roughly {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} of water off the Black Sea coast of modern Turkey. Therefore it is agreed that the Black Sea had been a landlocked freshwater lake (at least in upper layers) during the last glaciation and for some time after.

In the aftermath of the last glacial period, water levels in the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea rose independently until they were high enough to exchange water. The exact timeline of this development is still subject to debate. One possibility is that the Black Sea filled first, with excess fresh water flowing over the Bosphorus sill and eventually into the Mediterranean Sea. There are also catastrophic scenarios, such as the "[[Black Sea deluge theory]]" put forward by [[William Ryan (geologist)|William Ryan]] and [[Walter Pitman (geologist)|Walter Pitman]].

==== Deluge hypothesis ====
{{Main|Black Sea deluge hypothesis}}
In 1997, William Ryan and Walter Pitman from [[Columbia University]] published a hypothesis according to which a massive flood through the Bosphorus occurred in ancient times. They claim that the Black and [[Caspian Sea]]s were vast freshwater lakes, but then about 5600 BC, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] spilled over a rocky sill at the Bosphorus, creating the current communication between the Black and Mediterranean Seas. Subsequent work has been done both to support and to discredit this hypothesis, and archaeologists still debate it. Ryan and Pitman in fact associate this catastrophe with ancient [[Deluge (mythology)|flood myths]].<ref>{{cite book |author=William Ryan and Walter Pitman |title=Noah's Flood: The New Scientific Discoveries About the Event That Changed History |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] Paperbacks |place=New York |year=1998 |isbn=0-684-85920-3}}</ref>

=== Recorded history ===
[[File:Diego-homem-black-sea-ancient-map-1559.jpg|thumb|350px|A medieval map of the Black Sea by [[Diogo Homem]].]]
[[File:Aivazovsky - Black Sea Fleet in the Bay of Theodosia.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ivan Aivazovsky]]. ''Black Sea Fleet in the Bay of Theodosia'', just before the [[Crimean War]].]]

The Black Sea was a busy waterway on the crossroads of the ancient world: the Balkans to the West, the Eurasian [[steppes]] to the north, Caucasus and Central Asia to the East, Asia Minor and Mesopotamia to the south, and Greece to the south-west. 

The oldest processed gold in the world, arguably left by [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europeans]], was found in Varna, and the Black Sea was supposedly sailed by the [[Argonauts]]. The land at the eastern end of the Black Sea, [[Colchis]], (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), marked for the Greeks the edge of the known world. 

The steppes to the north of the Black Sea have been suggested as the original homeland ({{lang|lat|''[[Urheimat]]''}}) of the speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], (PIE) the progenitor of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family, by some scholars such as [[Marija Gimbutas]]; others move the heartland further east towards the [[Caspian Sea]], yet others to [[Anatolia]]. Numerous ancient ports, some older than the Egyptian pyramids{{cn|date=November 2013}}, line the Black Sea's coasts.

The Black Sea became an [[Ottoman Navy]] lake within five years of [[Genoa]] losing the [[Crimea]] in 1479, after which the only Western merchant vessels to sail its waters were those of [[Venice]]'s old rival [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]]. This restriction was gradually changed by the [[Russian Navy]] from 1783 until the relaxation of export controls in 1789 because of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Venetian Empire 1200-1670|page=17|author=David Nicolle |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=1989|isbn=978-0-85045-899-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Economic Life in Ottoman Europe: Taxation, Trade and the Struggle for Land, 1600-1800, Studies in Modern Capitalism|page=134|author=Bruce McGowan|isbn=978-0-521-13536-8}}</ref>

The Black Sea was a significant naval theatre of [[Naval warfare of World War I#Black Sea|World War I]] and saw both naval and land battles during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]].

===Archaeology===
Ancient trade routes in the region are currently being extensively studied by scientists, as the Black Sea was sailed by [[Hittites]], [[Carians]], [[Thracians]], [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]], [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], [[Slavs]], [[Varangians]], [[Crusaders]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanians]], [[Colchis|Georgians]], [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poles]], [[Tatars]], [[Ottomans]], and [[Russians]]. 

Perhaps the most promising areas in deepwater archaeology are the quest for submerged prehistoric settlements in the continental shelf and for ancient shipwrecks in the anoxic zone, which are expected to be exceptionally well preserved due to the absence of oxygen. This concentration of [[historical powers]], combined with the preservative qualities of the deep [[anoxic waters]] of the Black Sea, has attracted increased interest from [[marine archaeology|marine archaeologists]] who have begun to discover a large number of [[Ancient Black Sea shipwrecks|ancient ships and organic remains]] in a high state of preservation.

====Hydrocarbons exploration====
Since the 1980s, the [[Soviet Union]] started [[offshore drilling]] for [[petroleum]] in the sea's western portion (adjoining [[Ukraine]]'s coast). The independent Ukraine continued and intensified that effort within its [[Exclusive Economic Zone]], inviting major international oil companies for exploration. Discovery of the new, massive oilfields in the area stimulated an influx of foreign investments. It also provoked a short-term peaceful [[territorial dispute]]  with [[Romania]] which was resolved in 2011 by an international court redefining the Exclusive Economic Zones between the two countries.

====International and military use of the Straits====
The [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits|1936 Montreux Convention]] provides for a free passage of civilian ships between the international waters of the Black and the Mediterranean Seas. However, a single country (Turkey) has a complete control over the straits connecting the two seas. The 1982 amendments to the Montreux Convention allow Turkey to close the Straits at its discretion in both wartime and peacetime.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/bogazlar-sorunu/%20|title=Montreaux and The Bosphorus Problem}} {{tr icon}}</ref>
