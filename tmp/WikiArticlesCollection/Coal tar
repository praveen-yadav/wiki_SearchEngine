'''Coal tar''' is a brown or black liquid of extremely high [[viscosity]]. Coal tar is among the by-products when [[coal]] is 
[[carbonization|carbonized]] to make [[coke (fuel)|coke]] or [[coal gasification|gasified]] to make [[coal gas]]. Coal tars are complex and variable mixtures of [[phenols]], [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), and [[heterocyclic compounds]].<ref name="c">{{cite web

===Industrial===
Being flammable, coal tar is sometimes used for heating or to fire [[boilers]]. Like most heavy oils, it must be heated before it will flow easily.

Coal tar was a component of the first sealed roads. In its original development by [[Edgar Purnell Hooley]], [[tarmac]] was tar covered with granite chips.  Later the filler used was industrial [[slag]]. Today, petroleum derived binders and sealers are more commonly used. These sealers are used to extend the life and reduce maintenance cost associated with [[asphalt]] pavements, primarily in asphalt road paving, car parks and walkways.

A large part of the binders used in the graphite industry for making "green blocks" are coke oven volatiles (COV). A considerable portion of these COV used as binders is coal tar. During the baking process of the green blocks as a part of commercial [[graphite]] production, most of the coal tar binders are vaporised and are generally burned in an incinerator to prevent release into the atmosphere, as COV and coal tar can be injurious to health.

Coal tar is also used to manufacture paints, synthetic dyes, and photographic materials.

When used as a medication in the [[United States|U.S.]], coal tar preparations are considered [[over-the-counter drug]] pharmaceuticals and are subject to regulation by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration|USFDA]]. Named brands include [[Denorex]], Balnetar, Psoriasin, Tegrin, [[T/Gel]], and Neutar. When used in the extemporaneous preparation of topical medications, it is supplied in the form of coal tar topical solution [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]], which consists of a [[percentage solution|20% w/v]] solution of coal tar in [[alcohol]], with an additional 5% w/v of [[polysorbate 80]]&nbsp;USP; this must then be diluted in an ointment base such as [[petrolatum]].

The residue from the [[distillation]] of high-temperature coal tar, primarily a complex mixture of three or more membered condensed ring [[aromatic hydrocarbons]], was listed on 28 October 2008 as a [[substance of very high concern]] by the [[European Chemicals Agency]].

==Coal tar distillers==
In the [[coal gas]] era, there were many companies in Britain whose business was to [[distill]] coal tar to separate the higher-value fractions, such as [[naphtha]], [[creosote]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]].
