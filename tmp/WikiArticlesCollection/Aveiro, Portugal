''Raivas'' are also a typical biscuit of Aveiro.

==History==
Mumadona Dias was the first countess of Aveiro. The city dates back at least to the 10th century when it was known by its first [[Latin language|Latin]] name of ''Alavarium et Salinas'', literally, "a gathering place or preserve of birds and of great salt." The [[Moors]] invaded and then held it until the 11th century, after which it became popular with Portuguese royalty. 
The Princess [[Joan of Portugal (nun)|St. Joana]], daughter of [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] lived in Aveiro (in the Aveiro's Convent) until her death on the 12th May 1490.
In the winter of 1575, a terrible storm closed the entrance to its port, ending a thriving trade in [[metal]]s and [[tile]]s. The same storm also created a reef barrier at the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==Industry==
The city is also famous for its production of [[salt]] and for its [[seaweed]] harvest, which is used for fertilizer in the area.

==Famous people==
The famous explorer [[Afonso de Paiva|João Afonso]] was born in Aveiro. He was the first European to visit the region of [[Benin]] in [[Nigeria]] and named the river located there, the Rio Fermoso. He helped to build a fort in [[Elmina Castle|Mina]]. Unfortunately, he never came back to Portugal; he died in the region and is credited for bringing to Lisbon the first pepper that ever came out of those parts. He was also credited as one of the discoverers of the [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] fisheries.

The singer and composer José Manuel Cerqueira Afonso dos Santos (1929–1987) – better known as [[Zeca Afonso]] – was born in Aveiro.<ref>http://www.diafrica.org/nigeriaop/kenny/DH06.htm</ref>

The city is also famous for the ''Convento de Jesus'' (now known as the City Museum "Santa Joana"), built in the 15th century, which contains the tomb of the daughter of [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], [[Joan of Portugal (nun)|St. Joana]], who died in 1490. The presence of this royal personage, beatified in 1693, proved to be of great benefit when she bequeathed her valuable estate to the convent. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the convent housed a school of embroidery, which produced many of the sumptuous pieces kept in the museum.

==Aveiro University==
The [[Universidade de Aveiro|University of Aveiro]] was created in 1973 and is considered one of the most dynamic and innovative universities of Portugal, attracting thousands of students to the city.
The University has about 430 professors (with Ph.D. degrees), 11,000 undergraduate students, and 1,300 post-graduate students.
