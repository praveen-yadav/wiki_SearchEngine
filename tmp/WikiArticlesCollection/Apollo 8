'''Apollo 8''', the second [[human spaceflight|manned]] mission in the United States [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]], was launched on December 21, 1968, and became the first manned [[spacecraft]] to leave [[Earth]] [[orbit]], reach the Earth's [[Moon]], orbit it and return safely to Earth. The three-[[astronaut]] crew — Commander [[Frank Borman]], Command Module Pilot [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[William Anders]] — became the first humans to travel beyond [[low Earth orbit]], the first to see Earth as a whole planet, and then the first to directly see the [[far side of the Moon]]. The 1968 mission, the third flight of the [[Saturn V|Saturn&nbsp;V]] rocket and the first manned launch of the Saturn V, was also the first manned launch from the [[Kennedy Space Center|John F. Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, located adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]].

Originally planned as a second [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]]/[[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] test in an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]] in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious Command Module-only [[Lunar orbit|lunar-orbital]] flight to be flown in December, because the Lunar Module (LM) was not yet ready to make its first flight. This meant Borman's crew was scheduled to fly two to three months sooner than originally planned, leaving them a shorter time for training and preparation, thus placing more demands than usual on their time and discipline.

Apollo 8 took three days to travel to the Moon. It orbited ten times over the course of 20&nbsp;hours, during which the crew made a Christmas Eve [[Apollo TV camera|television broadcast]] in which they [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read the first 10 verses from]] the [[Book of Genesis]]. At the time, the broadcast was the most watched [[television|TV]] program ever. Apollo&nbsp;8's successful mission paved the way for [[Apollo 11]] to fulfill [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. The Apollo 8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27, 1968, when their spacecraft splashed down in the Northern Pacific Ocean.

This crew was unique among pre-shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew. This was also the first case of the rarity of an astronaut who had flown as commander subsequently flying as a non-commander, as Lovell had previously commanded Gemini XII.

===Backup crew===

|crew3_up         = [[Fred Haise|Fred W. Haise, Jr.]]
}}
On a lunar mission, the Command Module Pilot (CMP) was assigned the role of [[Celestial navigation|navigator]], while the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was assigned the role of [[flight engineer]], responsible for monitoring all spacecraft systems, even if the flight didn't include a Lunar Module.<ref name="Baker 1981">[[#Baker|Baker 1981]]</ref>

Lovell was originally the CMP on the back-up crew, with [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] as the prime crew's CMP. However, Collins was replaced in July 1968, after suffering a [[intervertebral disc|cervical]] [[Spinal disc herniation|disc herniation]] that required surgery to repair.<ref>[[#Collins|Collins 2001]], pp. 288–294</ref>

Edwin Aldrin was originally the backup LMP. When Lovell was rotated to the prime crew, no one with experience on [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]]-103 (the specific spacecraft used for the mission) was available, so Aldrin was moved to CMP and Fred Haise brought in as backup LMP. Neil Armstrong went on to command Apollo 11, where Aldrin was returned to the LMP position and Collins was assigned as CMP.

===Mission control===
The Earth-based mission control teams for Apollo&nbsp;8 consisted of astronauts assigned to the support crew, as well as non-astronaut flight directors and their staffs. The support crew members were not trained to fly the mission, but were able to stand in for astronauts in meetings and be involved in the minutiae of mission planning, while the prime and backup crews trained. They also served as [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)|CAPCOMs]] during the mission. For Apollo&nbsp;8, these crew members included astronauts [[John S. Bull]], [[Vance D. Brand]], [[Gerald P. Carr]], and [[Ken Mattingly]].<ref name="chronapp6">{{cite book |last1=Ertel |first1=Ivan D. |last2=Newkirk |first2=Roland W. |last3=Brooks |first3=Courtney G. |others=Compiled by Sally D, Gates, History Office, [[Lyndon B.

===Mission insignia===
The triangular shape of the insignia symbolizes the shape of the Apollo Command Module (CM). It shows a red figure-8 looping around the Earth and Moon representing the mission number as well as the circumlunar nature of the mission. On the red number 8 are the names of the three astronauts.<ref name="Lattimer 1985">[[#Lattimer|Lattimer 1985]]</ref>

The initial design of the insignia was developed by Jim Lovell. Lovell reportedly sketched the initial design while riding in the backseat of a [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]] flight from [[California]] to [[Houston]], shortly after learning of the re-designation of the flight to become a lunar-orbital mission. The graphic design of the insignia was done by Houston artist and animator William Bradley.<ref name="Lattimer 1985"/>

==Planning==

{{Main|List of Apollo mission types}}

[[Apollo 4]] and [[Apollo 6]] had been "A" missions, unmanned tests of the Saturn V launch vehicle using an unmanned Block&nbsp;I production model of the Apollo Command and Service Module in Earth orbit. {{nowrap|[[Apollo 7]]}}, scheduled for October 1968, would be a manned Earth-orbit flight of the CSM, completing the objectives for Mission&nbsp;"C."

[[File:Apollo-linedrawing.png|thumb|Apollo CSM diagram]]
Further missions depended on the readiness of the Lunar Module. Apollo 8 was planned as the "D" mission, to test the LM in a low Earth orbit in December 1968 by [[James McDivitt]], [[David Scott]] and [[Rusty Schweickart|Russell Schweickart]], while Borman's crew would fly the "E" mission, a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit as Apollo 9, in early 1969.

But production of the LM fell behind schedule, and when Apollo 8's LM arrived at [[Cape Canaveral]] in June 1968, significant defects were discovered, leading [[Grumman]], the lead contractor for the LM, to predict that the first mission-ready LM would not be ready until at least February 1969. This would mean delaying the "D" and subsequent missions, endangering the program's goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969.<ref name="Baker 1981"/><ref name="augsep1968">{{cite book |last1=Ertel |first1=Ivan D. |last2=Newkirk |first2=Roland W. |last3=Brooks |first3=Courtney G. |title=The Apollo Spacecraft: A Chronology |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/contents.htm#Volume%20IV |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080205020128/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/contents.htm |archivedate=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |volume=IV |year=1969–1978 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |id=NASA SP-4009 |oclc=23818 |lccn=69-60008 |chapter=Part 2 (N): Recovery, Spacecraft Redefinition, and First Manned Apollo Flight: August through September 1968 |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/v4p2n.htm |display-authors=2 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

[[George Low]], the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August to keep the program on track despite the LM delay. Since the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) would be ready three months before the Lunar Module, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December 1968. Instead of just repeating the "C" mission flight of Apollo&nbsp;7, this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon, with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit. The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have to wait until [[Apollo 10]], the scheduled "F" mission.<ref name="augsep1968" /> This also meant that the medium Earth orbit "E" mission could be dispensed with. The net result was that only the "D" mission had to be delayed.

[[File:Apollo 8 first stage in the Vehicle Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|upright|The first stage of AS-503 being erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|Vertical Assembly Building]] (VAB) on February 1, 1968]]
Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission, citing both confidence in the hardware and personnel, and the potential for a significant morale boost provided by a circumlunar flight. The only person who needed some convincing was [[James E. Webb]], the NASA administrator. With the rest of his agency in support of the new mission, Webb eventually approved the mission change. The mission was officially changed from a "D" mission to a "C-Prime" lunar-orbit mission, but was still referred to in press releases as an Earth-orbit mission at Webb's direction.<ref name="chariots11-5">{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by Samuel C.

With the change in mission for Apollo&nbsp;8, Director of Flight Crew Operations [[Deke Slayton]] decided to swap the crews of the D and E missions. This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft, requiring Borman's crew to use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104.<ref name="augsep1968" /><ref name="chariots11-3">{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by Samuel C.

On September 9, the crew entered the [[Space simulator|simulators]] to begin their preparation for the flight. By the time the mission flew, the crew had spent seven&nbsp;hours training for every actual hour of flight. Although all crew members were trained in all aspects of the mission, it was necessary to specialize. Borman, as commander, was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the [[Atmospheric entry|re-entry]]. Lovell was trained on [[Celestial navigation|navigating]] the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the Earth. Anders was placed in charge of checking that the spacecraft was in working order.<ref name="Baker 1981"/>

Added pressure on the Apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union's]] flight of some living creatures, including [[Russian tortoise]]s, in a [[cislunar]] loop around the Moon on [[Zond 5]] and return to Earth on September 21.<ref>[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 1994]], p. 76</ref> There was speculation within NASA and the press that they might be preparing to launch [[astronaut#Russian|cosmonauts]] on a similar [[Zond program#Circumlunar missions|circumlunar mission]] before the end of 1968.<ref name="Moon Race 1968">{{cite news |title=Poised for the Leap |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,844661-1,00.html |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 6, 1968 |location=New York}}</ref>

{{Main|Saturn V}}
[[File:Ap8-KSC-68PC-147.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;8 Saturn V being rolled out to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Pad 39A]]]]
The Saturn&nbsp;V rocket used by Apollo&nbsp;8 was designated SA-503, or the "03rd" model of the Saturn&nbsp;V ("5") Rocket to be used in the Saturn-Apollo ("SA") program. When it was erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|Vertical Assembly Building]] on December 20, 1967, it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned Earth-orbit test flight carrying a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] Command/Service Module. Apollo&nbsp;6 had suffered several major problems during its April 1968 flight, including severe [[pogo oscillation]] during its first stage, two second stage engine failures, and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit. Without assurances that these problems had been rectified, NASA administrators could not justify risking a manned mission until additional unmanned test flights proved that the Saturn&nbsp;V was ready.<ref name="stages1">[[#Bilstein|Bilstein 1996]], pp. 360–370</ref><ref name="chariots10-5">{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by Samuel C.

Teams from the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) went to work on the problems. Of primary concern was the pogo oscillation, which would not only hamper engine performance, but could exert significant g-forces on a crew. A task force of contractors, NASA agency representatives, and MSFC researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated, causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket. A system using helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed.<ref name="stages1" />

Of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight. Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum, causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two. When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection. As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown. Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine—a faulty igniter line. The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits, hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches.<ref name="stages1" />

The teams tested their solutions in August 1968 at the Marshall Space Flight Center.

As the first manned spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body, Apollo 8's profile had two different sets of orbital parameters, separated by a translunar injection maneuver.

Apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal {{convert|100|nmi|km|sigfig=3|adj=on}} circular Earth parking orbit. Apollo 8 was launched into an initial orbit with an [[apogee]] of {{convert|99.99|nmi|km}} and a [[perigee]] of {{convert|99.57|nmi|km}}, with an [[inclination]] of 32.51° to the [[Equator]], and an [[orbital period]] of 88.19&nbsp;minutes. Propellant venting increased the apogee by {{convert|6.4|nmi|km}} over the 2&nbsp;hours, 44&nbsp;minutes and 30&nbsp;seconds spent in the parking orbit.<ref name="orloff1" />

This was followed by a [[Trans-lunar injection|Trans-Lunar Injection]] (TLI) burn of the [[S-IVB]] third stage for 318&nbsp;seconds, accelerating the {{convert|63531|lb|kg|abbr=on}} spacecraft from an orbital velocity of {{convert|25567|ft/s|m/s}} to the injection velocity of {{convert|35505|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}},<ref name="orloff1" /> which set a record for the highest speed, relative to Earth, that humans had ever traveled.<ref name="chariots11-6">{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by Samuel C.

The standard lunar orbit for Apollo missions was planned as a nominal {{convert|60|nmi|km|adj=on}} circular orbit above the Moon's surface. Initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a [[perilune]] of {{convert|60.0|nmi|km}} and an [[apolune]] of {{convert|168.5|nmi|km}}, at an inclination of 12° from the lunar equator. This was then circularized at {{convert|60.7|nmi|km}} by {{convert|59.7|nmi|km}}, with an orbital period of 128.7&nbsp;minutes. The effect of lunar [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentrations]] ("masscons") on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted; over the course of the twenty-hour mission, the orbit was perturbated to {{convert|63.6|nmi|km}} by {{convert|58.6|nmi|km}}.<ref name="orloff1" />

Apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from Earth of {{convert |203752 |nmi |statmi km |abbr=off |sp=us}}.<ref name="orloff1" />

===Launch and trans-lunar injection===
[[File:Ap8-KSC-68PC-329.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo&nbsp;8 during launch, with a [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] of the Moon, which was not visible at the time]]
Apollo&nbsp;8 launched at 7:51:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]] on December 21, 1968, using the Saturn&nbsp;V's three [[Multistage rocket|stages]], [[S-IC]], [[S-II]], and S-IVB, to achieve Earth orbit. The launch phase experienced only three minor problems: The engines of the first stage, S-IC, underperformed by 0.75%, causing the engines to burn for 2.45&nbsp;seconds longer than planned, and toward the end of the second stage burn, S-II, the rocket underwent pogo oscillations. Frank Borman estimated the oscillations were approximately {{nowrap|12 [[hertz]]}} and {{nowrap|±0.25 ''[[g-force|g]]''}} (±2.5&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>).<ref name="orloff1" />

All three rocket stages fired during launch; the S-IC and S-II detached during launch.<ref name="chariots11-6" /> The S-IC impacted the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at {{Coord|30|12|N|74|7|W|name=Apollo 8 S-IC impact}} and the S-II second stage at {{Coord|31|50|N|37|17|W|name=Apollo 8 S-II impact}}.<ref name="zimmerman1" /><ref name="orloff1" /> The third stage of the rocket, S-IVB, assisted in driving the craft into Earth orbit but remained attached to later perform the TLI burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon.

Once in Earth orbit, both the Apollo&nbsp;8 crew and [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] spent the next 2&nbsp;hours and 38&nbsp;minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for TLI. The proper operation of third stage of the rocket, S-IVB, was crucial: in the last unmanned test, the S-IVB had failed to re-ignite for TLI.<ref name="chariots11-6" />

During the flight, three fellow astronauts served on the ground as [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)|Capsule Communicator]]s (usually referred to as "CAPCOMs") on a rotating schedule. The CAPCOMs were the only people who regularly communicated with the crew. Michael Collins was the first CAPCOM on duty and at 2&nbsp;hours, 27&nbsp;minutes and 22&nbsp;seconds after launch radioed, "Apollo&nbsp;8. You are Go for TLI."<ref name="journal day 1 TLI">{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/02earth_orbit_tli.htm |title=Day 1: Earth Orbit and Translunar Injection |last1=Woods |first1=W.

Over the next 12&nbsp;minutes before the TLI burn, the Apollo&nbsp;8 crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the S-IVB. The engine ignited on time and performed the TLI burn perfectly.

After the S-IVB had performed its required tasks, it was jettisoned. The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it. As the crew rotated the spacecraft, they had their first views of the Earth as they moved away from it. This marked the first time humans could view the whole Earth at once.<ref name="chariots11-6" /> Borman became worried that the S-IVB was staying too close to the Command/Service Module and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver. Mission Control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the [[Apollo CSM#Reaction Control System|Reaction Control System]] (RCS) thrusters on the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] (SM) to add {{convert|3|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} away from the Earth, but Borman did not want to lose sight of the S-IVB. After discussion, the crew and Mission Control decided to burn in this direction, but at {{convert|9|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} instead.<ref name="orloff1" /> These discussions put the crew an hour behind their flight plan.<ref name="chariots11-6" />

Five&nbsp;hours after launch, Mission Control sent a command to the S-IVB booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change the booster's trajectory. This S-IVB would then pass the Moon and enter into a solar orbit, posing no further hazard to Apollo&nbsp;8. The S-IVB subsequently went into a {{convert|0.99|by|0.92|AU|Gm|lk=on|adj=on}} solar orbit with an [[inclination]] of 23.47° from the [[Ecliptic|plane of the ecliptic]], and an orbital period of 340.80&nbsp;days.<ref name="orloff1" />

The Apollo&nbsp;8 crew were the first humans to pass through the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, which extend up to {{convert|15000|mi|km}} from Earth. Scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecraft's high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest [[X-ray]], or 1 [[Gray (unit)|milligray]] (during the course of a year, the average human receives a dose of 2&nbsp;to&nbsp;3&nbsp;mGy). To record the actual radiation dosages, each crew member wore a Personal Radiation [[Dosimeter]] that transmitted data to Earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew. By the end of the mission, the crew experienced an average radiation dose of 1.6 mGy.<ref name="Biomedical">{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=J.

Jim Lovell's main job as Command Module Pilot was as [[flight officer|navigator]]. Although Mission Control performed all of the actual navigation calculations, it was necessary to have a crew member serving as navigator so that the crew could successfully return to Earth in case of communication loss with Mission Control. Lovell navigated by star sightings using a [[sextant]] built into the spacecraft, measuring the angle between a star and the Earth's (or the Moon's) [[horizon]]. This task proved to be difficult, as a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft formed by the venting S-IVB made it hard to distinguish the stars.

By seven&nbsp;hours into the mission, the crew was about one hour and 40&nbsp;minutes behind flight plan due to the issues of moving away from the S-IVB and Lovell's obscured star sightings. The crew now placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC), also known as "barbecue" roll. PTC involved the spacecraft rotating about once per hour along its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft. In direct sunlight, the spacecraft could be heated to over {{convert|200|C|F|abbr=on}} while the parts in shadow would be {{convert|-100|C|F|abbr=on}}. These temperatures could cause the [[atmospheric reentry#Thermal protection systems|heat shield]] to crack or propellant lines to burst. As it was impossible to get a perfect roll, the spacecraft actually swept out a [[Conical surface|cone]] as it rotated. The crew had to make minor adjustments every half-hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger.<ref name="journal day 1 Maroon">{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/04day1_maroon.htm |title=Day 1: Maroon Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

The first mid-course correction came 11&nbsp;hours into the flight. Testing on the ground had shown that the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Propulsion System|Service Propulsion System]] (SPS) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its [[combustion chamber]] was "coated" first. Burning the engine for a short period would accomplish coating. This first correction burn was only 2.4&nbsp;seconds and added about {{convert|20.4|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} velocity [[Retrograde and prograde motion|prograde]] (in the direction of travel).<ref name="orloff1" /> This change was less than the planned {{convert|24.8|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} due to a bubble of [[helium]] in the [[redox|oxidizer]] lines causing lower than expected fuel pressure. The crew had to use the small RCS thrusters to make up the shortfall. Two later planned mid-course corrections were canceled as the Apollo&nbsp;8 trajectory was found to be perfect.<ref name='journal day 1 Maroon' />

11&nbsp;hours into the flight, the crew had been awake for over 16&nbsp;hours. Before launch, NASA had decided that at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise. Borman started the first sleep shift, but between the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises, he found sleep difficult.<ref name='journal day 1 Maroon' />

[[File:As8-16-2583.jpg|thumb|Apollo 8 [[S-IVB]] rocket stage, shortly after separation]]

About an hour after starting his sleep shift, Borman requested clearance to take a [[Secobarbital|Seconal]] [[Barbiturate|sleeping pill]]. However, the pill had little effect. Borman eventually fell asleep but then awoke feeling ill. He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces that the crew cleaned up to the best of their ability. Borman initially decided that he did not want everyone to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control. The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed. After recording a description of Borman's illness they requested that Mission Control check the recording, stating that they "would like an evaluation of the voice comments."<ref name="journal day 2 green">{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/06day2_green.htm |title=Day 2: Green Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

The Apollo&nbsp;8 crew and Mission Control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second floor control room (there were two identical control rooms in Houston on the second and third floor, only one of which was used during a mission). The conference participants decided that there was little to worry about and that Borman's illness was either a [[Gastroenteritis|24-hour flu]], as Borman thought, or a reaction to the sleeping pill.<ref>[[#Collins|Collins 2001]], p. 306</ref> Researchers now believe that he was suffering from [[space adaptation syndrome]], which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|vestibular system]] adapts to [[weightlessness]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Quine |first=Tony |date=April 2007|title=Addicted to space: An appreciation of Anousheh Ansari, Part II |journal= Spaceflight|volume=49 |issue=4 |page=144|issn=0038-6340 |publisher=[[British Interplanetary Society]]}}</ref> Space adaptation syndrome had not been an issue on previous spacecraft ([[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]), as those astronauts were unable to move freely in the comparatively smaller cabins of those spacecraft.

The cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight, except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course. During this time, NASA scheduled a television broadcast at 31&nbsp;hours after launch. The Apollo&nbsp;8 crew used a 2&nbsp;kg camera that broadcast in [[black-and-white]] only, using a [[Video camera tube|Vidicon]] tube. The camera had two [[lens (optics)|lenses]], a very [[wide-angle lens|wide-angle (160°) lens]], and a [[telephoto lens|telephoto (9°) lens]].<ref name="chariots11-6" />

During this first broadcast, the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the Earth appeared from space. However, difficulties aiming the narrow-angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the Earth impossible. Additionally, the Earth image became saturated by any bright source without proper [[Optical filter|filters]]. In the end, all the crew could show the people watching back on Earth was a bright blob. After broadcasting for 17&nbsp;minutes, the rotation of the spacecraft took the [[high-gain antenna]] out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday.<ref name="chariots11-6" />

By this time, the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts. Lovell went to sleep 32½&nbsp;hours into the flight—3½&nbsp;hours before he had planned to. A short while later, Anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill.<ref name="chariots11-6" />

The crew was unable to see the Moon for much of the outward cruise. Two factors made the Moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft: three of the five windows fogging up due to out-gassed oils from the [[silicone]] [[sealant]], and the [[Orientation (geometry)|attitude]] required for the PTC. It was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.<ref name="zimmerman1" />

The Apollo&nbsp;8 made a second television broadcast at 55&nbsp;hours into the flight. This time, the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the Earth through the telephoto lens. Although difficult to aim, as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first television pictures of the Earth. The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth and what was visible and the colors they could see. The transmission lasted 23&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="chariots11-6" />

===Lunar sphere of influence===
At about 55&nbsp;hours and 40&nbsp;minutes into the flight, the crew of Apollo&nbsp;8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body.<ref name="orloff1" /> In other words, the effect of the Moon's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational force]] on Apollo&nbsp;8 became stronger than that of the Earth. At the time it happened, Apollo&nbsp;8 was {{convert|38759|mi|km}} from the Moon and had a speed of {{convert|3990|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} relative to the Moon.<ref name="orloff1" /> This historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their [[trajectory]] with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. They would continue to do so until they performed their last mid-course correction, switching to a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit. It was only 13&nbsp;hours until they would be in lunar orbit.<ref name="lostmoon">[[#Lovell & Kluger|Lovell & Kluger 1994]]</ref>

The last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) was a second mid-course correction. It was in [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]] (against direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft down by {{convert|2.0|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, effectively lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon.<ref name="orloff1" /> At exactly 61&nbsp;hours after launch, about {{convert|24200|mi|km}} from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11&nbsp;seconds. They would now pass {{convert|71.7|mi|km}} from the [[Geology of the Moon#Lunar landscape|lunar surface]].<ref name="zimmerman1" /><ref name="orloff1" />

At 64&nbsp;hours into the flight, the crew began to prepare for Lunar Orbit Insertion-1 (LOI-1). This maneuver had to be performed perfectly, and due to [[orbital mechanics]] had to be on the far side of the Moon, out of contact with the Earth. After Mission Control was polled for a "[[Launch status check|go/no go]]" decision, the crew was told at 68&nbsp;hours, they were Go and "riding the best bird we can find."<ref name="journal day 3 LOI">{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/11day3_black_approach.htm |title=Day 3: The Black Team - Approaching the Moon |last1=Woods |first1=W.

With 10&nbsp;minutes before the LOI-1, the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place. At that time, they finally got their first glimpses of the Moon. They had been flying over the unlit side, and it was Lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight [[wiktionary:oblique|oblique]]ly illuminating the lunar surface. The LOI burn was only two&nbsp;minutes away, so the crew had little time to appreciate the view.<ref name="lostmoon" />

===Lunar orbit===
The SPS ignited at 69&nbsp;hours, 8&nbsp;minutes, and 16&nbsp;seconds after launch and burned for 4&nbsp;minutes and 13&nbsp;seconds, placing the Apollo&nbsp;8 spacecraft in orbit around the Moon. The crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives. If the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time, the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly [[ellipse|elliptical]] lunar orbit or even flung off into space. If it lasted too long they could have impacted the Moon. After making sure the spacecraft was working, they finally had a chance to look at the Moon, which they would orbit for the next 20&nbsp;hours.<ref name="nssdc orbit">{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1968-118A |title=Apollo 8 |work=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref>

On Earth, Mission Control continued to wait. If the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time, the crew would appear early from behind the Moon. However, this time came and went without Apollo&nbsp;8 reappearing. Exactly at the calculated moment, the signal was received from the spacecraft, indicating it was in a {{convert|193.3|by|69.5|mi|km|adj=on}} orbit about the Moon.<ref name="nssdc orbit" />

After reporting on the status of the spacecraft, Lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like:

Lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over. One of the crew's major tasks was [[reconnaissance]] of planned future landing sites on the Moon, especially one in [[Mare Tranquillitatis]] that would be the Apollo&nbsp;11 landing site. The launch time of Apollo&nbsp;8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site. A [[film camera]] had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record a frame every second of the Moon below. Bill Anders spent much of the next 20&nbsp;hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest. By the end of the mission the crew had taken 700 photographs of the Moon and 150 of the Earth.<ref name="zimmerman1" />

Throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with Earth, Borman kept asking how the data for the SPS looked. He wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the Earth if necessary. He also asked that they receive a "go/no go" decision before they passed behind the Moon on each orbit.<ref name="journal day 4-123" />

As they reappeared for their second pass in front of the Moon, the crew set up the equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface. Anders described the craters that they were passing over. At the end of this second orbit they performed the 11-second LOI-2 burn of the SPS to circularize the orbit to {{convert|70.0|by|71.3|mi|km}}.<ref name="nssdc orbit" /><ref name="journal day 4-123" />

Through the next two orbits, the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the Moon. During the third pass, Borman read a small prayer for his church. He had been scheduled to participate in a service at St. Christopher's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Church near [[Seabrook, Texas]], but due to the Apollo&nbsp;8 flight was unable. A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control, Rod Rose, suggested that Borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service.<ref name="zimmerman1" /><ref name="journal day 4-123" />

In the foreword to the Millennial Edition of his novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' [[Arthur C. Clarke]] says that crew told him "they had been tempted to radio back the discovery of a large black monolith," but discretion prevailed.<ref>[[#Clarke|Clarke 2000]], p. xvi</ref>

====Earthrise====
{{main|Earthrise}}
When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front, the crew witnessed Earthrise for the first time in human history (NASA's [[Lunar Orbiter 1]] took the very first picture of an Earthrise from the vicinity of the Moon, on August 23, 1966).<ref>[[#Poole|Poole 2008]]</ref> Borman saw the Earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others, taking a black-and-white photo as he did so. In the ensuing scramble Anders took the [[Earthrise|more famous color photo]], later picked by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century.<ref name="journal day 4-456">{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/14day4_orbits456.htm |title=Day 4: Lunar Orbits 4, 5 and 6 |last1=Woods |first1=W.

Earthrise is generally only visible when orbiting the Moon, other than at selected places near the Moon's [[wiktionary:Limb|limb]], where [[libration]] carries the Earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon.

Anders continued to take photographs while Lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so Borman could rest.<ref name="journal day 4-456"/> Despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft, Borman was able to sleep for two orbits, awakening periodically to ask questions about their status.<ref name="journal day 4-456"/> Borman awoke fully, however, when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having not had a good night's sleep in over three days. Taking command, he ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed. At first Anders protested saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. At last Anders agreed as long as Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the Moon. Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert. For the next two orbits Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm. On subsequent Apollo missions, crews would avoid this situation by sleeping on the same schedule.
[[File:Apollo 8 genesis reading.ogg|left|thumb|The Apollo 8 Genesis reading.]]

As they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the second television transmission began. Borman introduced the crew, followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the Moon. Borman described it as being "a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing."<ref>[[#De Groot|De Groot 2006]], p. 229</ref> Then, after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth. Each man on board [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read a section from the Biblical creation story]] from the Book of Genesis. Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth. His message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit. Borman said, "And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you - all of you on the good Earth."<ref name="moonport">{{cite book |last1=Benson |first1=Charles D. |last2=Faherty |first2=William Barnaby |title=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/contents.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080123133438/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/contents.html |archivedate=January 23, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2008 |year=1978 |publisher=NASA |id=NASA SP-4204 |chapter=Apollo 8 - A Christmas Gift |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch20-9.html |deadurl=no}} Ch.20-9.</ref>

The only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the [[Trans-Earth injection|Trans-Earth Injection]] (TEI), which was scheduled for 2½&nbsp;hours after the end of the television transmission. The TEI was the most critical burn of the flight, as any failure of the SPS to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit, with little hope of escape. As with the previous burn, the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the Moon, out of contact with Earth.

The burn occurred exactly on time. The spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re-emerged from behind the Moon at 89&nbsp;hours, 28&nbsp;minutes, and 39&nbsp;seconds, the exact time calculated. When voice contact was regained, Lovell announced, "Please be informed, there is a [[Santa Claus]]," to which Ken Mattingly, the current CAPCOM, replied, "That's affirmative, you are the best ones to know."<ref name="journal day 4 TEI">{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/16day4_final_orbit_tei.htm |title=Day 4: Final Orbit and Trans-Earth Injection |last1=Woods |first1=W.

===Unplanned manual re-alignment===
Later, Lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings, maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard. However, he accidentally erased some of the computer's memory, which caused the [[Apollo PGNCS#Inertial Measurement Unit|Inertial Measurement Unit]] (IMU) to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift-off and fire the thrusters to "correct" the module's attitude.<ref name="Benke" />

Once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module's attitude, they realized they would have to re-enter data that would tell the computer its real position. It took Lovell ten&nbsp;minutes to figure out the right numbers, using the thrusters to get the stars [[Rigel]] and [[Sirius]] aligned, and another 15&nbsp;minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer.<ref name="lostmoon" />

16 months later, Lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re-alignment, under more critical conditions, during the [[Apollo 13]] mission, after that module's IMU had to be turned off to conserve energy. In his 1994 book, ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13]]'', Lovell wrote, "My training &#91;on Apollo 8&#93; came in handy!" In that book he dismissed the incident as a "planned experiment," requested by the ground crew.<ref name="lostmoon" /> In subsequent interviews Lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident, caused by his mistake.<ref name="Benke" /><ref name="zimmerman1" />

===Cruise back to Earth and re-entry===
[[File:Apollo 8 reentry, December 27, 1968.jpg|thumb|upright|Reentry, December 27, 1968]]

The cruise back to Earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft. As long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly, the spacecraft would re-enter two-and-half days after TEI and [[splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]] in the Pacific.

On Christmas afternoon, the crew made their fifth television broadcast.<ref>
