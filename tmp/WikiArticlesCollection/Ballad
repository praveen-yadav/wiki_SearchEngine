A '''ballad''' is a form of verse, often a [[narrative]] set to [[music]]. Ballads derive from the medieval [[Music of France|French]] ''chanson balladée'' or ''[[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]]'', which were originally "dancing songs". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later [[medieval]] period until the 19th century and used extensively across [[Europe]] and later the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and [[North Africa]]. Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet [[Broadside (music)|broadsides]]. The form was often used by [[poet]]s and [[composer]]s from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century it took on the meaning of a slow form of popular love song and the term is now often used as synonymous with any love song, particularly the pop or rock power ballad.

==Origins==
The ballad derives its name from medieval [[French language|French]] dance songs or "ballares" ([[Latin|L]]: ''ballare'', to dance).<ref>W. Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (Harvard, 1944; 2nd edn., 1972), p. 70.</ref> (from which 'ballet' is also derived), as did the alternative rival form that became the French [[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]].<ref>A. Jacobs, ''A Short History of Western Music'' (1972, Penguin, 1976), p. 21.</ref><ref>W. Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (1944, Harvard, 1972), pp. 70-72.</ref> As a narrative song, their theme and function may originate from [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] traditions of storytelling that can be seen in poems such as [[Beowulf]].<ref name=Houseman1952>J. E. Housman, ''British Popular Ballads'' (1952, London: Ayer Publishing, 1969), p. 15.</ref> Musically they were influenced by the [[Minnesinger]].<ref>A. Jacobs, ''A Short History of Western Music'' (Penguin 1972, 1976), p. 20.</ref> The earliest example of a recognisable ballad in form in England is ‘[[Judas (ballad)|Judas]]’ in a 13th-century [[manuscript]].<ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5">A. N. Bold, ''The Ballad'' (Routledge, 1979), p. 5.</ref>

==Ballad form==
{{See also|AABA form}}
Ballads were originally composed to accompany dances, and so were composed in couplets with refrains in alternate lines. These refrains would have been sung by the dancers in time with the dance.<ref name="British Literature pg 610">"Popular Ballads", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century'', p. 610.</ref> Most northern and west European ballads are written in [[ballad stanza]]s or [[quatrains]] (four-line [[stanzas]]) of alternating lines of [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] (an unstressed followed by a stressed syllable) [[tetrameter]] (eight syllables) and iambic [[trimeter]] (six syllables), known as [[Common metre#Variants|ballad meter]]. Usually, only the second and fourth line of a quatrain are rhymed (in the scheme a, b, c, b), which has been taken to suggest that, originally, ballads consisted of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.<ref name="I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66">D. Head and I. Ousby, ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 66.</ref> As can be seen in this stanza from ‘[[Lord Thomas and Fair Annet]]’:

The '''horse'''| fair '''Ann'''|et '''rode'''| up'''on'''|<br />
He '''amb'''|led '''like'''| the '''wind'''|,<br />
With '''sil'''|ver '''he'''| was '''shod'''| be'''fore''',<br />
With '''burn'''|ing '''gold'''| be'''hind'''|.<ref name=Houseman1952/>

However, there is considerable variation on this pattern in almost every respect, including length, number of lines and rhyming scheme, making the strict definition of a ballad extremely difficult. In southern and eastern Europe, and in countries that derive their tradition from them, ballad structure differs significantly, like Spanish ''romanceros'', which are [[octosyllabic]] and use [[Literary consonance|consonance]] rather than rhyme.<ref>T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' ([[ABC-CLIO]], 1997), p. 81.</ref> 

Ballads usually use the common dialect of the people and are heavily influenced by the region in which they originate. Scottish ballads in particular are distinctively un-English, even showing some pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as the fairies in the Scottish ballad "Tam Lin".<ref>"Popular Ballads" ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century'', pp. 610-17.</ref> The ballads do not have any known author or  correct version; instead, having been passed down mainly by oral tradition since the Middle Ages, there are many variations of each. The ballads remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the 18th century led collectors such as Bishop Thomas Percy to publish volumes of popular ballads.<ref name="British Literature pg 610"/>

In all traditions most ballads are narrative in nature, with a self-contained story, often concise and rely on imagery, rather than description, which can be tragic, historical, romantic or comic.<ref name="I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66"/> Themes concerning rural laborers and their sexuality are common, and there are many ballads based on the Robin Hood legend.<ref>http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/980</ref> Another common feature of ballads is repetition, sometimes of fourth lines in succeeding stanzas, as a [[refrain]], sometimes of third and fourth lines of a stanza and sometimes of entire stanzas.<ref name=Houseman1952/>

==Composition==
Scholars of ballads are often divided into two camps, the ‘communalists’ who, following the line established by the German scholar [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) and the [[Brothers Grimm]], argue that ballads arose by a combined communal effort and did not have a single author, and ‘individualists’, following the thinking of English collector [[Cecil Sharp]], who assert that there was a single original author.<ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"/> The communalist position tends to lead to the view that more recent, particularly printed broadside ballads, where the author is known, are a debased form of the genre. The individualists' position has tended to lead to the view that later changes in the words of ballads are corruptions of an original text.<ref>M. Hawkins-Dady, ''Reader's Guide to Literature in English'' (Taylor & Francis, 1996), p. 54.</ref> More recently scholars have pointed to the interchange of oral and written forms of the ballad.<ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353">T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 353.</ref>
==Transmission==
The transmission of ballads comprises a key stage in their re-composition. In romantic terms this process is often dramatized as a narrative of degeneration away from the pure 'folk memory' or 'immemorial tradition.'<ref>Ruth Finnegan, ''Oral Poetry: Its Nature, Significance and Social Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 140.</ref> In the introduction to ''Minstrelsy of the Scottish Borders'' (1802) the romantic writer Walter Scott noted the need to 'remove obvious corruptions' in order to attempt to restore the original. For Scott, the process of multiple recitations 'incurs the risk of impertinent interpolations from the conceit of one rehearser, unintelligible blunders from the stupidity of another, and omissions equally to be regretted, from the want of memory of a third.' Similarly, John Robert Moore noted 'a natural tendency to oblivescence.'<ref>"The Influence of transmission on the English Ballads", ''Modern Language Review'' 11 (1916), p. 387.</ref> According to Scott, transcribed ballads often have a 'flatness and insipidity' compared to their oral counterparts.

==Classification==
[[File:Illustration to the ballad Young Beckie from "Some British Ballads" .jpg|right|thumb|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to ''[[Young Bekie]].'']] European Ballads have been generally classified into three major groups: traditional, broadside and literary. In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and 'native American ballads', developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music. For the late 19th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads, and these are the origin of the modern use of the term ballad to mean a slow love song.

===Traditional ballads===
{{See also|Child Ballads}}
The traditional, classical or popular (meaning of the people) ballad has been seen as with the wandering [[minstrels]] of late medieval Europe.<ref name=Houseman1952/> From the end of the 15th century there are printed ballads that suggest a rich tradition of popular music. A reference in [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', indicates that ballads about [[Robin Hood]] were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material is [[Wynkyn de Worde]]'s collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.<ref name=Sweers2005>B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 45.</ref>

Early collections of English ballads were made by [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703) and in the [[Roxburghe Ballads]] collected by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer (1661–1724).<ref name=Sweers2005/> In the 18th century there were increasing numbers of such collections, including [[Thomas d'Urfey]]'s ''Wit and Mirth: or, Pills to Purge Melancholy'' (1719–20) and Bishop [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]'s ''Reliques of Ancient English Poetry'' (1765).<ref name=Sweers2005/> The last of these also contained some oral material and by the end of the 18th century this was becoming increasingly common, with collections including John Ritson's, ''The Bishopric Garland'' (1784), which paralleled the work of figures like [[Robert Burns]] and [[Walter Scott]] in Scotland.<ref name=Sweers2005/> It has been suggested that the increasing interest in traditional popular ballads during the eighteenth century was prompted by social issues such as the enclosure movement as many of the ballads deal with themes concerning rural laborers.<ref>Robin Ganev,''Songs of Protest, Songs of Love: Popular Ballads in 18th Century Britain''</ref> James Davey has suggested that the common themes of sailing and naval battles may also have prompted the use of popular ballads as naval recruitment tools <ref>[http://enterprise.gre.ac.uk/news/articles/2011/gmi-ballads-talk]</ref>

Key work on the traditional ballad was undertaken in the late 19th century in Denmark by [[Svend Grundtvig]] and for England and Scotland by the Harvard professor [[Francis James Child]].<ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"/> They attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions. Since Child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as ''[[The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]''.<ref>T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 352.</ref> There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are the religious, supernatural, tragic, love ballads, historic, legendary and humorous.<ref name=Houseman1952/>

===Broadsides===
{{Main|Broadside (music)}}
[[File:Tragical Ballad 18th century.png|right|thumb|An 18th-century broadside ballad: ''The tragical ballad: or, the lady who fell in love with her serving-man''.]]
Broadside ballads (also known as 'roadsheet’, ‘stall’, ‘vulgar’ or ‘come all ye’ ballads) were a product of the development of cheap print in the 16th century. They were generally printed on one side of a medium to large sheet of poor quality paper. In their heyday of the first half of the 17th century, they were printed in black-letter or gothic type and included multiple, eye-catching illustrations, a popular tune tile, as well as an alluring poem.<ref>E. Nebeker, [http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/page/heyday-of-the-broadside-ballad "The Heyday of the Broadside Ballad"], ''English Broadside Ballad Archive, University of California-Santa Barbara'', retrieved 15 August 2011.</ref> By the 18th century, they were printed in white letter or roman type and often without much decoration (as well as tune title). These later sheets could include many individual songs, which would be cut apart and sold individually as "slipsongs." Alternatively, they might be folded to make small cheap books or "chapbooks" which often drew on ballad stories.<ref>G. Newman and L. E. Brown, ''Britain in the Hanoverian Age, 1714-1837: An Encyclopedia'' (Taylor & Francis, 1997), pp. 39-40.</ref> They were produced in huge numbers, with over 400,000 being sold in England annually by the 1660s.<ref>B. Capp, ‘Popular literature’, in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 199.</ref> Tessa Watt estimates the number of copies sold may have been in the millions.<ref>T. Watt, ''Cheap Print and Popular Piety, 1550-1640'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 11.</ref> Many were sold by travelling [[chapmen]] in city streets or at fairs.<ref>M. Spufford, ''Small Books and Pleasant Histories: Popular Fiction and Its Readership in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 111-28.</ref> The subject matter varied from what has been defined as the traditional ballad, although many traditional ballads were printed as broadsides. Among the topics were love, religion, drinking-songs, legends, and early journalism, which included disasters, political events and signs, wonders and prodigies.<ref>B. Capp, ‘Popular literature’, in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 204.</ref>

===Literary ballads===
Literary or lyrical ballads grew out of an increasing interest in the ballad form among social elites and intellectuals, particularly in the [[Romantic movement]] from the later 18th century. Respected literary figures like [[Robert Burns]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]] in Scotland both collected and wrote their own ballads, using the form to create an artistic product. Similarly in England [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] produced a collection of [[Lyrical Ballads]] in 1798, including Coleridge’s ‘[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]’. The Romantics such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats were attracted to the simple and natural style of these folk ballads, encouraging them to imitate the style <ref>"Popular Ballads", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature'', p. 610.</ref> At the same time in Germany [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] cooperated with [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] on a series of ballads, some of which were later set to music by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]].<ref>J. R. Williams, ''The Life of Goethe'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2001), pp. 106-8.</ref> Later important examples of the poetic form included Rudyard Kipling’s ‘[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]’ (1892-6) and [[Oscar Wilde]]’s ‘[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]’ (1897).<ref>S. Ledger, S. McCracken, ''Cultural Politics at the Fin de Siècle'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 152.</ref>  Victorian and late Romantic poets such as Christina Rossetti deployed ballad forms to explore spiritual and moral issues, and used the form to discuss the stereotypical treatment and representation of men and women's roles in society.

==Ballad operas==
{{Main|Ballad opera}}
[[Image:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|200px|Painting based on ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', Act III Scene 2, [[William Hogarth]], c. 1728]]
In the 18th century ballad operas developed as a form of [[England|English]] [[stage play|stage entertainment]], partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene.<ref>M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962) pp. 467-68.</ref> It consisted of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story. Rather than the more aristocratic themes and music of the Italian opera, the ballad operas were set to the music of popular folk songs and dealt with lower-class characters.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/50485/ballad-opera</ref> Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period. The first, most important and successful was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728, with a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[John Christopher Pepusch]], both of whom probably influenced by [[Paris]]ian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas d'Urfey]] (1653–1723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work.<ref>F. Kidson, ''The Beggar's Opera: Its Predecessors and Successors'' (Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 71.</ref> Gay produced further works in this style, including a sequel under the title ''Polly''. [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], Arne, Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.<ref>M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467-68.</ref> Ballad opera was attempted in America and Prussia. Later it moved into a more pastoral form, like [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]]'s ''Love in a Village'' (1763) and [[William Shield|Shield’s]] ''Rosina'' (1781), using more original music that imitated, rather than reproduced, existing ballads. Although the form declined in popularity towards the end of the 18th century its influence can be seen in light operas like that of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s early works like ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' as well as in the modern musical.<ref>G. Wren, ''A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Art of Gilbert and Sullivan'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 41.</ref> In the 20th century, one of the most influential plays, [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s (1928) ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' was a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite, but only using one tune from the original.<ref>K. Lawrence, ''Decolonizing Tradition: New Views of Twentieth-century "British" Literary Canons'' (University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 30.</ref> The term ballad opera has also been used to describe musicals using folk music, such as ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy]]'s ''The Transports'' in 1977.<ref>A. J. Aby and P. Gruchow, ''The North Star State: A Minnesota History Reader'', (Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2002), p. 461.</ref> The satiric elements of ballad opera can be seen in some modern musicals such as ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''.<ref>L. Lehrman, ''Marc Blitzstein: A Bio-bibliography'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 568.</ref>

==Beyond Europe==
===Native American Ballads===
[[Image:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] outside the town of Talcott in [[Summers County, West Virginia]]]]
Native American ballads are ballads that are native to North America (not to be confused with ballads performed by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native Americans]]).<ref name=Cohen2005/> Some 300 ballads sung in North America have been identified as having origins in British traditional or broadside ballads.<ref name=Cohen2005>N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), pp. 14-29.</ref> Examples include ‘[[The Streets of Laredo]]’, which was found in Britain and Ireland as ‘The Unfortunate Rake’; however, a further 400 have been identified as originating in North America, including among the best known, ‘[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]' and '[[Jesse James (folk song)|Jesse James]]'.<ref name=Cohen2005/> They became an increasing area of interest for scholars in the 19th century and most were recorded or catalogued by [[George Malcolm Laws]], although some have since been found to have British origins and additional songs have since been collected.<ref name=Cohen2005/> They are usually considered closest in form to British broadside ballads and in terms of style are largely indistinguishable, however, they demonstrate a particular concern with occupations, journalistic style and often lack the ribaldry of British broadside ballads.<ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"/>

===Blues ballads===
{{Main|Blues ballad}}
The blues ballad has been seen as a fusion of Anglo-American and Afro-American styles of music from the 19th century. Blues ballads tend to deal with active protagonists, often anti-heroes, resisting adversity and authority, but frequently lacking a strong narrative and emphasising character instead.<ref name=Cohen2005/> They were often accompanied by banjo and guitar which followed [[the blues]] musical format.<ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"/> The most famous blues ballads include those about [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and [[Casey Jones]].<ref name=Cohen2005/>

===Bush ballads===
{{Main|Bush ballad}}
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover to [[Banjo Paterson]]'s seminal 1905 collection of bush ballads, entitled ''The Old Bush Songs'']]
The ballad was taken to Australia by early settlers from Britain and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural [[outback]]. The rhyming songs, [[poems]] and tales written in the form of ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in [[The Bush]], and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards.<ref name="abc.net.au">Kerry O'Brien December 10, 2003 7:30 Report, [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1007523.htm abc.net.au]</ref> The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including [[John Meredith (folklorist)|John Meredith]] whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the [[National Library of Australia]].<ref name="abc.net.au"/> The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, [[sheep shearing]], wanderings, war stories, the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]], class conflicts between the landless working class and the [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] (landowners), and outlaws such as [[Ned Kelly]], as well as love interests and more modern fare such as [[Truck driver|trucking]].<ref>G. Smith, ''Singing Australian: A History of Folk and Country Music'' (Pluto Press Australia, 2005), p. 2.</ref> The most famous bush ballad is "[[Waltzing Matilda]]",  which has been called "the unofficial national anthem of Australia".<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/epubs/waltzingmatilda/ Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?"], The National Library of Australia, retrieved 14 March 2008.</ref>

==Sentimental ballads==
Now the most commonly understood meaning of the term ballad, sentimental ballads, sometimes called "tear-jerkers" or "drawing-room ballads" owing to their popularity with the middle classes, had their origins in the early ‘[[Tin Pan Alley]]’ music industry of the later 19th century. They were generally sentimental, narrative, strophic songs published separately or as part of an [[opera]] (descendants perhaps of [[broadside (music)|broadside ballads]], but with [[sheet music|printed music]], and usually newly composed. Such songs include "Little Rosewood Casket" (1870), "[[After the Ball (song)|After the Ball]]" (1892) and "[[Danny Boy]]".<ref name=Cohen2005/> By the [[Victorian era]], ''ballad'' had come to mean any sentimental popular song, especially so-called "royalty ballads", which publishers would pay popular singers to perform in Britain and the [[United States]] in "ballad concerts." Some of [[Stephen Foster]]'s songs exemplify this genre.<ref>Temperley (II,2).</ref> By the 1920s, composers of [[Tin Pan Alley]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] used ''ballad'' to signify a slow, sentimental tune or love song, often written in a fairly standardized form (see below). Jazz musicians sometimes broaden the term still further to embrace all slow-tempo pieces.<ref>Witmer. See also Middleton (I,4,i).</ref>

===Jazz, blues and traditional pop===
As new genres of music, such as [[ragtime]], [[blues]] and [[jazz]], began to emerge in the early 20th century the popularity of the genre faded, but the association with sentimentality led to the term ballad being used for a slow love song from the 1950s onwards.<ref name=Cohen2005/> Most [[traditional pop music|pop standard]] and jazz ballads are built from a single, introductory ''verse''; usually around 16 [[bar (music)|bars]] in length, and ending on the [[dominant (music)|dominant]]; the ''chorus'' or ''[[refrain]]'', usually it is 16 or 32 bars long, and in [[AABA form]] (though other forms such as ABAC are not uncommon). In AABA forms, the B section is usually referred to as the ''[[bridge (music)|bridge]]''; often a brief ''[[coda (music)|coda]]'', sometimes based on material from the bridge, was added as in "[[Over the Rainbow]]".<ref>Randel 1986, p. 68.</ref> Other key traditional pop and jazz ballads include: "[[Body and Soul (song)|Body and Soul]]" by [[Johnny Green]]; "[[Misty (song)|Misty]]" by [[Erroll Garner]]; "[[The Man I Love (song)|The Man I Love]]" by [[George Gershwin]]; "[[My Funny Valentine]]" by [[Rodgers and Hart]], "[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]" by [[Billie Holiday]], "[[Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye]]" by [[Cole Porter]], the instrumental ballad "[[Naima]]" by [[John Coltrane]], "[[In a Sentimental Mood]]" by [[Duke Ellington]] and "[[Always (1925 song)|Always]]" by [[Irving Berlin]].<ref>A. Forte, ''The American Popular Ballad of the Golden Era, 1924-1950'' (Princeton University Press, 1995).</ref>

The most common use of the term ballad in modern [[pop music]] is for an emotional love song.<ref name=Cohen2005p297>N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 297.</ref> When the word ''ballad'' appears in the title of a song, as for example in [[The Beatles]]' "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]" or [[Billy Joel]]'s "[[The Ballad of Billy the Kid]]", the folk-music sense is generally implied. ''Ballad'' is also sometimes applied to strophic story-songs more generally, such as [[Don McLean]]'s "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]".<ref>D. R. Adams, ''Rock 'n' roll and the Cleveland Connection

===Power ballads===
[[Simon Frith]], the British sociomusicologist and former rock critic, identifies the origins of the power ballad in the emotional singing of soul artists, particularly [[Ray Charles]], and the adaptation of this style by performers such as [[Eric Burdon]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and [[Joe Cocker]] to produce slow-tempo songs often building to a loud and emotive chorus backed by drums, electric guitars and sometimes choirs.<ref name=Frithpop/> According to Charles Aaron, power ballads came into existence in the early 1970s, when rock stars attempted to convey profound messages to audiences.<ref name=aaron>{{cite book|last=Aaron|first=Charles|editors=Jonathan Lethem, Paul Bresnick|title=Da Capo Best Music Writing 2002: The Year's Finest Writing on Rock, Pop, Jazz, Country, and More|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|chapter=Don't Fight the Power|year=2002|isbn=978-0-306-81166-1|page=132}}</ref>

Aaron argues that the power ballad broke into the mainstream of American consciousness in 1976 as FM radio gave a new lease of life to earlier songs such as [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" (1971), [[Aerosmith]]'s "[[Dream On (Aerosmith song)|Dream On]]" (1973), and [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s "[[Free Bird]]" (1974).<ref name=aaron/> [[The Carpenters]]' "[[Goodbye to Love]]", (1972), has also been identified as a [[prototype]] of the power ballad.<ref>{{cite news |last=Perrone |first=Pierre |title=Tony Peluso: Guitarist whose solos on The Carpenters' 'Goodbye to Love' ushered in the power-ballad era|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/tony-peluso-guitarist-whose-solos-on-the-carpenters-goodbye-to-love-ushered-in-the-powerballad-era-2041048.html|accessdate=4 February 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=2 August 2010}}</ref> Notable power ballad examples include [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]'s version of "[[Love Hurts]]" (1975), [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]' [[Creatures of the Night|"I Still Love You"]] (1982), [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s "[[I Want to Know What Love Is]]" (1984),<ref name=Frithpop>S.
