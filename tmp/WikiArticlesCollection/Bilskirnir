'''Bilskirnir''' ([[Old Norse]] "lightning-crack"<ref name=ORCHARD20>Orchard (1997:20).</ref>) is the hall of the god [[Thor]] in [[Norse mythology]]. Here he lives with his wife [[Sif]] and their children. According to ''[[Grímnismál]]'', the hall is the greatest of buildings and contains 540 rooms, located in [[Asgard]], as are all the dwellings of the [[Æsir|gods]], in the kingdom of [[Þrúðheimr]] (or [[Þrúðvangar]] according to ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' and ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'').

==Modern influence==
*The hall inspired the name of an [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] [[starship]] commanded by [[Thor (Stargate)|Supreme Commander Thor]], in the television series [[Stargate SG-1]] named [[Beliskner]].
*There is a [[National Socialist black metal|NSBM]] band from [[Hesse]], [[Germany]] named Bilskirnir.
