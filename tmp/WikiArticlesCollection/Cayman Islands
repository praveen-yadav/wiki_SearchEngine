The '''Cayman Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|m|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|k|eɪ|'|m|æ|n}}) are a [[British overseas territories|British Overseas Territory]] located in the western [[Caribbean Sea]]. The territory comprises the three islands of [[Grand Cayman]], [[Cayman Brac]] and [[Little Cayman]], located south of [[Cuba]] and northwest of [[Jamaica]]. The Cayman Islands are considered to be part of the geographic [[Western Caribbean Zone]] as well as the [[Greater Antilles]]. The territory is a major world [[offshore financial centre]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tax/schemes/cayman.html|title=Tax me if you can.

== History ==
{{main|History of the Cayman Islands}}
The Cayman Islands remained largely uninhabited until the 17th century. While there is no archaeological evidence for an indigenous people on the islands, a variety of settlers from various backgrounds made their home on the islands, including [[pirate]]s, refugees from the [[Spanish Inquisition]], shipwrecked sailors, and deserters from [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army in [[Jamaica]].<ref>Robert Bauman, ''The Complete Guide to Offshore Residency'' (2007, ISBN 0-9789210-9-7), p. 115</ref>

[[File:Cayman Islands National Museum - George Town, Grand Cayman.jpg|thumb|left|Cayman Islands National Museum, George Town, Grand Cayman.]]
The first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on [[Grand Cayman]] around 1661. He was the grandson of the original settler named Bodden who was probably one of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers at the taking of Jamaica in 1655.<ref>Keith Thompson, ''Life in The Caribbean'' (2010, ISBN 9987-16-015-8), p. 152</ref>

[[Kingdom of England|England]] took [[English overseas possessions|formal control]] of the Cayman Islands, along with Jamaica, as a result of the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)|Treaty of Madrid]] of 1670. Following several unsuccessful attempts at settlement, a permanent English-speaking population in the islands dates from the 1730s. With settlement, after the first royal land grant by the [[Governor of Jamaica]] in 1734, came the perceived need for slaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gocayman.ky/history.html |title=Cayman Islands History |publisher=Gocayman.ky |date= |archivedate=2008-10-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081012073753/http://www.gocayman.ky/history.html}}</ref> Many were brought to the islands from Africa; this is evident today with the majority of native Caymanians being of African and English descent. The results of the first census taken in the islands in 1802 showed the population on Grand Cayman to be 933 with 545 of those inhabitants being slaves. Slavery was abolished in the Cayman Islands in 1834. At the time of abolition, there were over 950 slaves owned by 116 Caymanian families.<ref>''The Cayman Islands Annual Report 1988'' (Cayman Islands, 1988), p. 127</ref>

The islands continued to be governed as part of the [[Colony of Jamaica (1655–1962)|Colony of Jamaica]] until 1962, when they became a separate [[Crown colony]] while Jamaica became an independent [[Commonwealth realm]].<ref>Graeme R. Newman, ''Crime and Punishment Around the World: Africa and the Middle East'', (2010, ISBN 0-313-35133-3), p. 82</ref>
[[File:Heroes Square of George Town.jpg|thumb|right|The Heroes Square in the centre of George Town, which commemorates Cayman Islands' war dead. The Legislative Assembly building is at the left.]]

The Cayman Islands historically have been a tax-exempt destination. On 8 February 1794, the Caymanians rescued the crews of a group of ten [[merchant ship]]s, including HMS ''Convert'', an incident that has since become known as the [[Wreck of the Ten Sail]]. The ships had struck a reef and run aground during rough seas.<ref>Lawson Wood, ''The Cayman Islands'' (2007, ISBN 1-84537-897-0), p. 12</ref> Legend has it that [[George III of Great Britain and Ireland|King George III]] rewarded the island with a promise never to introduce taxes as compensation for their generosity, as one of the ships carried a member of the King's own family, his son [[William IV of England|Prince William]], [[Duke of Clarence and St Andrews]]. While this remains a popular legend, the story is not true.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zayas|1914}}</ref>

However, whatever the history, in practice the government of the Cayman Islands has always relied on indirect and not direct taxes. The islands have never levied [[income tax]], [[capital gains tax]], or any [[wealth tax]], making them a popular [[tax haven]].<ref name=biswas>Rajiv Biswas, ''International Tax Competition: A Developing Country Perspective'' (Commonwealth Secretariat, 2002, ISBN 0-85092-688-2, 2002), p. 38</ref>

On 11–12 September 2004 the island of [[Grand Cayman]], which lies largely unprotected at sea level, was hit by [[Hurricane Ivan]], creating an 8-ft [[storm surge]] which flooded many areas of Grand Cayman. An estimated 83% of the dwellings on the island were damaged including 4% requiring complete reconstruction. A reported 70% of all dwellings suffered severe damage from flooding or wind. Another 26% sustained minor damage from partial roof removal, low levels of flooding, or impact with floating or wind driven hurricane debris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ky/portal/page?_pageid=1143%2C5067689&_dad=portal&_schema=portal |title=Hurricane Ivan Remembered |publisher=Hazard Management Cayman Islands |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> Power, water and communications were disrupted for months in some areas, as Ivan was the worst hurricane to hit the islands in 86 years.<ref>Keith Thompson, ''Caribbean Islands: The Land and the People'' (2010, ISBN 9987-16-018-2), p. 152</ref> Grand Cayman began a major rebuilding process and within two years, its [[infrastructure]] was nearly returned to pre-hurricane status. Due to the tropical location of the islands, more hurricane or tropical systems have affected the Cayman Islands than any other region in the Atlantic basin; it has been brushed or directly hit, on average, every 2.23 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurricanecity.com/city/caymanislands.htm |title=Grand Cayman's history with tropical systems |publisher=Hurricanecity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref>

{{main|Geography of the Cayman Islands}}

The Cayman Islands are located in the western [[Caribbean Sea]] and are the peaks of a massive underwater ridge, known as the Cayman Ridge (or Cayman Rise). This ridge flanks the [[Cayman Trough]], {{convert|6000|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep<ref>[http://www.wri.org/publication/content/7880 Cayman Islands, World Resources Institute]</ref> which lies {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south.<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/csi/pub/papers/bush.htm Phillippe G.

All three islands were formed by large [[coral heads]] covering submerged ice age peaks of western extensions of the Cuban [[Sierra Maestra]] range and are mostly flat. One notable exception to this is [[The Bluff (Cayman Islands)|The Bluff]] on Cayman Brac's eastern part, which rises to {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the highest point on the islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/highlow.htm |title=World Atlas Highest and Lowest points |work=web page |publisher=Graphic Maps |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}</ref>

Terrain is mostly a low-lying [[limestone]] base surrounded by [[coral reef]]s.

===Fauna===
{{further|List of mammals of the Cayman Islands}}
The mammalian species in the islands include the introduced [[Dasyprocta punctata|Central American agouti]]<ref name = MSW3>{{MSW3 Hystricognathi | id = 13400244 | page = 1558}}</ref> and [[Bats of the Caribbean#Grand Cayman|eight species of bats]]. At least three now extinct [[List of rodents of the Caribbean#Cayman Islands|native rodent species]] were present up until the discovery of the islands by Europeans. A number of cetaceans are found in offshore waters.

Cayman [[birds|avian fauna]] includes two [[Endemism|endemic]] subspecies of ''[[Amazona]]'' parrots: ''Amazona leucocephala hesterna'', or Cayman Brac parrot, native only to Cayman Brac, and ''Amazona leucocephala caymanensis'' or [[Grand Cayman parrot]], which is native to the Cayman Islands, forested areas of Cuba, and the [[Isla de la Juventud]].

===Climate===
[[File:Hurricane signs rum point.jpg|thumb|left|Signs at Rum Point commemorating landed and near-miss hurricanes.]]
{{main|Climate of the Cayman Islands}}
The Cayman Islands have a [[tropical marine climate]], with a [[wet season]] of warm, rainy summers (May to October) and a [[dry season]] of relatively cool winters (November to April).{{Citation needed|reason=Koppen Climate numbers and descriptions are generally used|date=July 2011}}

A major [[natural hazard]] is the [[tropical cyclone]]s that form during the [[Atlantic hurricane season]] from June to November.

On 11 and 12 September 2004, [[Hurricane Ivan]] struck the Cayman Islands. The storm resulted in two deaths, and caused great damage to the infrastructure on the islands. The total economic impact of the storms was estimated to be $3.4 billion.<ref>Boxall, Simon. "Hurricane Ivan Remembered". Cayman Prepared. 9 September 2008.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of the Cayman Islands}}

The Cayman Islands have more registered businesses than people.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/3709816.stm |title=Regions and territories: Cayman Islands |publisher=BBC News |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref> The latest population estimate of the Cayman Islands is about 56,000 as of mid-2011, representing a mix of more than 100 nationalities. Out of that number, about half are of Caymanian descent. About 60% of the population is of mixed race (mostly mixed African-Caucasian). The islands are almost exclusively Christian, with large numbers of Presbyterians and Catholics. The vast majority of the population resides on [[Grand Cayman]], followed by [[Cayman Brac]] and [[Little Cayman]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cj.html |title = CIA – The World Factbook – Cayman Islands |accessdate = 2008-06-23}}</ref> The population is projected to rise to 60,000 by 2020.

The capital of the Cayman Islands is [[George Town, Cayman Islands|George Town]], which is located on the southwest coast of Grand Cayman.

{{main|Economy of the Cayman Islands}}

With an average income of around KYD$47,000, Caymanians have the highest standard of living in the Caribbean. According to the [[CIA World Factbook]], the Cayman Islands GDP per capita is the 14th highest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html |title = CIA – The World Factbook – Rank Order – GDP – per capita (PPP) |accessdate = 2008-06-23}}</ref> The islands print their own currency, the [[Cayman Islands Dollar]] (KYD), which is pegged to the [[U.S. dollar]] at a fixed rate of 1 KYD = 1.25 USD.<ref>[http://www.caymanislands.ky/tour_guide/country.aspx]</ref>

The government's primary source of income is [[indirect tax]]ation: there is no [[income tax]], [[capital gains tax]], or [[corporation tax]].<ref name=biswas/> An [[import duty]] of 5% to 22% (automobiles 29.5% to 100%) is levied against goods imported into the islands. Few goods are exempt; notable exemptions include books, cameras, and [[infant formula]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On 15 July 2012 the Cayman Islands premier [[McKeeva Bush]] announced the intended introduction of a "community enhancement fee" in the form of a [[payroll tax]] to be paid solely by expatriate workers. Caymanians themselves were to remain exempt from this tax. This would have been the first direct tax on income in the Cayman Islands' history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.compasscayman.com/caycompass/2012/07/26/Government-announces-expat-tax/ |title=Government announces expat tax Pension contributions involved |publisher=Caymanian Compass |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> Bush also announced a five percent fee on "certain categories of employment" to be payable by businesses. However, the payroll tax would lower GDP and was scrapped before it had been implemented.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/offshorefinance/9467072/Cayman-Islands-scrap-expat-tax-planca.html Cayman Islands scrap expat tax] from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' at telegraph.co.uk</ref>

One of [[Grand Cayman]]'s main attractions is [[Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman|Seven Mile Beach]], on which a number of the island's hotels and resorts are located. Named one of the Ultimate Beaches by Caribbean Travel and Life, Seven Mile Beach is located on the western shore of Grand Cayman Island.

[[File:Southern Stingrays At Stingray City Grand Cayman.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Stingrays pass each other at Stingray City sandbar off Grand Cayman Island.]]
All three islands offer [[scuba diving]], and the Cayman Islands are home to several snorkelling locations, where tourists can swim with [[stingray]]s. The most popular area to do this is [[Stingray City, Grand Cayman]] Stingray City is a top attraction in Grand Cayman and originally started in the 1980s, when divers started feeding squid to stingrays. The stingrays started to associate the sound of the boat motors with food, and thus visit this area year round.<ref>[http://www.caymanislands.ky/activities/attractions/stingraycity.aspx]</ref>

There are two [[shipwreck]]s off the shores of Cayman Brac, including the [[Sinking ships for wreck diving sites#List of ships sunk for wreck diving|MV Captain Keith Tibbetts]];<ref>Tim Rock, ''Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Cayman Islands'' (2nd edn, 2007, ISBN 1-74059-897-0), p. 99</ref> Grand Cayman also has several shipwrecks off its shores, including one deliberate one. On 30 September 1994 the {{USS|Kittiwake|ASR-13|6}} was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register. In November 2008 her ownership was transferred for an undisclosed amount to the government of the Cayman Islands, which had decided to sink Kittiwake in June 2009 to form a new artificial reef off Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman. Following several delays, the ship was finally scuttled according to plan on 5 January 2011. The Kittiwake has become a dynamic environment for marine life. While visitors are not allowed to take anything, there are endless sights. Each of the 5 decks of the ship offers squirrelfish, rare sponges, Goliath groupers, urchins, and more. Experienced and beginner divers are invited to swim around the Kittiwake.<ref>[http://www.caymanislands.ky/activities/attractions/kittiwake.aspx]</ref>

Other Grand Cayman tourist attractions include the Ironshore landscape of [[Hell, Grand Cayman|Hell]], the {{convert|23|acre|m2|sing=on}} marine theme park Boatswain's Beach, also home of the Cayman Turtle Farm, the production of gourmet [[sea salt]], and the Mastic Trail, a hiking trail through the forests in the centre of the island. The National Trust for the Cayman Islands provides guided tours weekly on the Mastic Trail and other locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.ky |title=National Trust For the Cayman islands |publisher=Nationaltrust.org.ky |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref>

Points of interest include the [[East End Light]] (sometimes called Gorling Bluff Light) is a lighthouse located at the east end of Grand Cayman island in the Cayman Islands. The lighthouse is the centerpiece of East End Lighthouse Park, managed by the [[National Trust for the Cayman Islands]]; the first navigational aid on the site was the first lighthouse in the Cayman Islands.

Financial services generated CI$1.2 billion of GDP in 2007 (55% of the total economy), 36% of all employment and 40% of all government revenue. In 2010, the country ranked fifth internationally in terms of value of liabilities booked in the Cayman Islands and sixth in terms of assets booked.

Starting in the mid-late 1990s, [[offshore financial centres]], such as the Cayman Islands, came under increasing pressure from the [[OECD]] for their allegedly harmful tax regimes, where the OECD wished to prevent low-tax regimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace. The OECD threatened to place the Cayman Islands and other [[financial centres]] on a "black list" and impose sanctions against them.<ref name="Rogoff">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tax/schemes/cayman.html |title=Haven or havoc? |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref> However, the Cayman Islands successfully avoided being placed on the OECD black list in 2000 by committing to regulatory reform to improve transparency and begin information exchange with OECD member countries about their citizens.<ref name="Rogoff"/>

In 2004, under pressure from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the Cayman Islands agreed in principle to implement the [[European Union Savings Directive]] (EUSD), but only after securing some important benefits for the financial services industry in the Cayman Islands. As the Cayman Islands are not subject to [[European Union|EU]] laws, the implementation of the EUSD is by way of bilateral agreements between each EU member state and the Cayman Islands. The government of the Cayman Islands agreed on a model agreement, which set out how the EUSD would be implemented with the Cayman Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ask.bm/uploaded/Publication/641_File_5.pdf |title=Guide to the EU Savings Directive |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref>

A report published by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), in March 2005, assessing supervision and regulation in the Cayman Islands' banking, insurance and securities industries, as well as its [[money laundering]] regime, recognised the jurisdiction's comprehensive regulatory and compliance frameworks. "An extensive program of legislative, rule and guideline development has introduced an increasingly effective system of regulation, both formalizing earlier practices and introducing enhanced procedures", noted IMF assessors. The report further stated that "the supervisory system benefits from a well-developed banking infrastructure with an internationally experienced and qualified workforce as well as experienced lawyers, accountants and auditors", adding that, "the overall compliance culture within Cayman is very strong, including the compliance culture related to AML (anti-money laundering) obligations".<ref>[http://www.caymanfinance.gov.ky/portal/page?_pageid=1186,1549172&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL International Cooperation]</ref><ref>[http://www.rhesq.com/Terrorism/Caymans%20in%20Perspective.pdf Money Laundering in the Cayman Islands: A Global Perspective, Cayman Financial Review, Third Quarter, 2010]</ref>

On 4 May 2009, United States President [[Barack Obama]] declared his intentions to curb the use of financial centres by multinational corporations. In his speech, he singled out the Cayman Islands as a tax shelter.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Crave |url=http://www.politicalcrave.com/2009/05/04/transcript-obama-preaches-hypocrisy-against-tax-havens-and-tax-loopholes/ |title=Transcript: Obama Preaches Against Tax Havens And Tax LoopHoles |publisher=Political Crave |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref> The next day, the Cayman Island Financial Services Association submitted an open letter to the President detailing The Cayman Islands' role in international finance and its value to the US financial system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/05-05-2009/0005019996&EDATE= |title=An Open Letter to President Obama From the Cayman Islands Financial Services Association |publisher=News.prnewswire.com |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref>

The Cayman Islands were ranked as the world's second most significant tax haven on the [[Tax Justice Network]]'s "Financial Secrecy Index" from 2011, scoring slightly higher than [[Luxembourg]] and falling behind only [[Switzerland]].<ref>http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/2011results.html</ref>

===Labour===
The Cayman Islands has a small population and therefore a limited work force. [[Work permit]]s may therefore be granted to foreigners. On average, there have been more than 21,000 foreigners holding valid work permits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.ky/pages.php?page=immigrationdata |title=Work Permit Stats |publisher=Eso.ky |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref> [[File:Jamaican woodcarver Bodden Town Grand Cayman.jpg|thumb|Jamaican-born roadside woodcarver working outside Bodden Town]]

====Work permits for non-citizens====
In order to work in the Cayman Islands as a [[Alien (law)|non-citizen]], a work permit is required. This involves passing a police background check and a health check. A prospective immigrant worker will not be granted a permit unless certain medical conditions are present which include testing negative for [[syphilis]] or [[HIV]]. A permit may be granted to individuals on special work.

A foreigner must first have a job in order to move to the Cayman Islands. The employer applies and pays for the work permit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ky/portal/page?_pageid=1142,1592726&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |title=C.I. Government Website – Entry Requirements for Work Permits |publisher=Gov.ky |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref> Work permits are not granted to foreigners who are in the Cayman Islands (unless it is a renewal). The Cayman Islands Immigration Department requires foreigners to remain out of the country until their work permit has been approved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.island-search.com/browse.php?cat=1748 |title=Online Employment Resources |publisher=Island-search.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref>

The Cayman Islands presently imposes a controversial "rollover" in relation to [[expatriate]] workers who require a work permit. Non-Caymanians are only permitted to reside and work within the territory for a maximum of seven years unless they satisfy the criteria of key employees. Non-Caymanians who are 'rolled over' may return to work additional 7-year periods subject to a 1-year gap between their periods of work. The policy has been the subject of some controversy within the press. Law firms have been particularly upset by the recruitment difficulties that it has caused.<ref>[http://www.caymannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000106/010674.htm Row brews over rollover]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}, 22 January 2007, Cayman net News</ref> Other less well remunerated employment sectors have been affected as well. Concerns about safety have been expressed by diving instructors and realtors have also expressed concerns. Others support the rollover as necessary to protect Caymanian identity in the face of large immigration of expatriate workers.<ref>[http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1011499 Government takes up permit issue], Editorial, 5 March 2006, Camanian Compass</ref>

Concerns have been expressed that in the long term, the policy may damage the preeminence of the Cayman Islands as an [[offshore financial centre]] by making it difficult to recruit and retain experienced staff from onshore financial centres. Government employees are no longer exempt from this "rollover" policy according to this report in a local newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1024210 |title = Cayman Islands – Cay Compass News Online – Rollover for civil servants |accessdate = 2008-06-23}}</ref> The governor has used his constitutional powers, which give him absolute control for the disposition of [[civil service]] employees to determine which expatriate civil servants are dismissed after seven years service and which are not.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

This policy is incorporated in the Immigration Law (2003 revision), written by the United Democratic Party government, and subsequently enforced by the People's Progressive Movement Party government. Both governments agree to the term limits on foreign workers, and the majority of Caymanians also agree it is necessary to protect local culture and heritage from being eroded by a large number of foreigners gaining residency and citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.caymanobserver.com/viewarticle.cfm?id=36&Section=LocalNews |title = Cayman Observer |accessdate = 2008-06-23}}</ref>

The Cayman Islands are a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]], listed by the UN Special Committee of 24 as one of the last [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self-governing territories]]. The current Constitution, incorporating a Bill of Rights, was ordained by a [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|statutory instrument]] of the [[United Kingdom]] in 2009.<ref>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1379/pdfs/uksi_20091379_en.pdf</ref> An 20-seat [[Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands|Legislative Assembly]] is elected by the people every four years to handle domestic affairs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commonwealth elections observers give Cayman Islands high marks|url=http://www.caribbeannewsnow.com/headline-Commonwealth-elections-observers-give-Cayman-Islands-high-marks-16049.html|work=www.caribbeannewsnow.com|publisher=Caribbean News Now|accessdate=May 28, 2013|date=May 27, 2013|quote=The amendment of elections law in 2012 increased the number of elected members of the Legislative Assembly from fifteen to eighteen.}}</ref> Of the elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), seven are chosen to serve as government ministers in a Cabinet headed by the Governor. The [[Premier]] is appointed by the Governor.<ref>Cayman Islands Constitution, 2009, part III article 49</ref>

A [[Governor of the Cayman Islands|Governor]] is appointed by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]] of the United Kingdom on the advice of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] to represent the monarch.<ref>Cayman Islands Constitution, 2009, part II</ref> Governors can exercise complete legislative and executive authority if they wish through blanket powers reserved to them in the constitution.<ref>Constitution, articles 55 and 81</ref> Bills which have passed the [[Legislative Assembly]] require [[Royal Assent]] before becoming effective. The Constitution empowers the Governor to withhold [[Royal Assent]] in cases where the legislation appears to him or her to be repugnant to or inconsistent with the Constitution or affects the rights and privileges of the Legislative Assembly or the Royal Prerogative, or matters reserved to the Governor by article 55.<ref>Constitution article 78</ref> The executive authority of the Cayman Islands is vested in [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] and is exercised by the Government, consisting of the Governor and the Cabinet.<ref>Constitution article 43</ref> There is an office of the Deputy Governor, who must be a Caymanian and have served in a senior public office. The Deputy Governor is the Acting Governor when the office of Governor is vacant, or the Governor is not able to discharge his duties or is absent from the Cayman Islands.<ref>Constitution article 35</ref> The current Governor of the Cayman Islands is [[Excellency|His Excellency]] [[Duncan Taylor (diplomat)|Duncan Taylor]], [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], and the current Deputy Governor is Franz Manderson, [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]].

The Cabinet is composed of two official members and seven elected members, called ministers; one of whom is designated [[Leader of Government Business|Premier]].

The official members are the [[Deputy Governor]] and the [[Attorney General]]. They are appointed by the governor in accordance with Her Majesty's instructions, and although they have seats in the Legislative Assembly, under the 2009 Constitution, they do not vote.

The seven ministers are voted into office by the 18 elected members of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands]]. One of the ministers, the leader of the majority political party, is appointed premier by the governor.

After consulting the premier, the governor allocates a portfolio of responsibilities to each Cabinet member. Under the principle of collective responsibility, all ministers are obliged to support in the Assembly any measures approved by Cabinet.

Almost 80 departments, sections and units carry out the business of government, joined by a number of statutory boards and authorities set up for specific purposes, such as the Port Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Immigration Board, the Water Authority, the University College Board of Governors, the National Pensions Board and the Health Insurance Commission.

The defence of the Cayman Islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom. The [[Royal Cayman Islands Police Service]] provides [[police]] services in the country. The [[Cayman Islands Cadet Corps]] was formed in March 2001.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Since 2000, there have been two official major political parties: [[United Democratic Party (Cayman Islands)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) and the [[People's Progressive Movement (Cayman Islands)|People's Progressive Movement]] (PPM). While there has been a shift to political parties, many contending for an office still run as independents.

===Taxation===
No direct taxation is imposed on residents and Cayman Islands companies. The government receives the majority of its income from indirect taxation. Duty is levied against most imported goods, which is typically in the range of 22% to 25%. Some items are exempted, such as baby formula, books, cameras and certain items are taxed at 5%. Duty on automobiles depends on their value. The duty can amount to 29.5% up to $20,000.00 KYD CIF (cost, insurance and freight) and up to 42% over $30,000.00 KYD CIF for expensive models. The government charges flat licensing fees on financial institutions that operate in the islands and there are work permit fees on foreign labour. A 13% government tax is placed on all tourist accommodations in addition to US$25.00 airport departure tax which is built into the cost of an airline ticket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caymanislands.ky/vacation_essentials/entry_requirements.aspx |title=Cayman Islands – Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, Travel and Tourism Site |publisher=Caymanislands.ky |date=23 January 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref>

There are no taxes on profits, capital gains, income or any withholding taxes charged to foreign investors. There are no estate or death duties payable on Cayman Islands real estate or other assets held in the Cayman Islands.{{Citation needed|reason=may need to be merged with above.

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of the Cayman Islands}}
Foreign policy is controlled by the United Kingdom, as the islands remain an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands' most important relationships were with Britain and [[Jamaica]], in recent years, as a result of economic dependence, a relationship with the [[United States]] has developed.

Though the Cayman Islands are involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for narcotics trafficking and [[money laundering]]. In an attempt to address this, the government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the [[Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty]] of 1986 with the United States, in order to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to cooperate with foreign investigators.

Due to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands have no representation either in the [[United Nations]] or in most other international organisations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organisations, being an associate member of [[Caricom]] and [[UNESCO]], and a member of a sub-bureau of [[Interpol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/United-Kingdom |title=United Kingdom / Europe / Member countries / Internet / Home - INTERPOL |publisher=Interpol.int |date=30 December 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref>

The defence and internal security of the Cayman Islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom.
