==Etymology==

The name '''Afyon Kara Hisar''' (literally ''opium black castle'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), since [[opium]] was widely grown here and there is a castle on a black rock. Also known simply as '''Afyon'''. Older spellings include '''Karahisar-i Sahip''', '''Afium-Kara-hissar''' and '''Afyon Karahisar'''.  The city was known as Afyon (opium), until the name was changed to Afyonkarahisar by the [[Turkish Parliament]] in 2004.

==History==
[[File:15th century map of Turkey region.jpg|thumb|Photo of a 15th-century map showing region containing Nicopolis.]]

The top of the rock in Afyon has been fortified for a long time. It was known to the [[Hittites]] as '''Hapanuwa''', and was later occupied by [[Phrygians]], [[Lydians]] and [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]] until it was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. After the death of Alexander the city (now known as  '''Akroinοn''' (Ακροϊνόν) or '''Nikopolis''' (Νικόπολις) in [[Ancient Greek]]), was ruled by the [[Seleucids]] and the kings of [[Pergamon]], then [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. The [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] after his [[Battle of Akroinon|victory]] over [[Arab]] besiegers in 740 renamed the city '''[[Nicopolis (disambiguation)|Nicopolis]]''' (Greek for "city of victory"). The [[Seljuq Turks]] then arrived in 1071 and changed its name to '''Kara Hissar''' ("black castle") after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201&nbsp;meters above the town. Following the dispersal of the Seljuqs the town was occupied by the [[Sâhib Ata]] and then the [[Germiyanids]].

The castle was much fought over during the [[Crusades]] and was finally conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Beyazid I]] in 1392 but was lost after the invasion of [[Timur Lenk]] in 1402. It was recaptured in 1428 or 1429.

The area thrived during the Ottoman Empire, as the centre of opium production and Afyon became a wealthy city with the typical Ottoman urban mixture of Turks and [[Armenians]]. During the 1st World War British prisoners of war who had been captured at Gallipoli were housed here in an empty Armenian church at the foot of the rock. During the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] campaign (part of the [[Turkish War of Independence]])  Afyon and the surrounding hills were occupied by French, Italian and then Greek forces. However, it was recovered on 27 August 1922, a key moment in the Turkish counter-attack in the Aegean region. After 1923 Afyon became a part of the Republic of Turkey.

The region was a major producer of raw opium (hence the name ''Afyon'') until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the USA in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased.  Now poppies are grown under a strict licensing regime.  They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the poppy straw method of extraction.<ref>https://fco-stage.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/pdf20/fco_adidu_licitcultivation</ref>

Afyon was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1927-1938.<ref>[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]. Banknote Museum: [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E1/18.htm 1. Emission Group - Fifty Turkish Lira - I. Series]. – Retrieved on 20 April 2009.</ref>

==Climate==
Afyonkarahisar has a [[continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dsa'') and [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSk''), with cold and snowy winters and hot and dry summers. Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn.

==Afyon today==
Afyon is the centre of an agricultural area and the city has a country town feel to it. There is little in the way of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey. However [[Afyon Kocatepe University]] opened in the 1990s and this must surely lead to improvements eventually.
Nowadays Afyon is known for its [[marble]] (in 2005 there were 355 marble quarries in the province of Afyon producing high quality white stone), its ''[[sucuk]]'' (spiced sausages), its ''[[kaymak]]'' (meaning either ''cream'' or a white [[Turkish Delight]]) and various handmade weavings. There is also a large cement factory.

This is a natural crossroads, the routes from [[Ankara]] to [[İzmir]] and from [[Istanbul]] to [[Antalya]] intersect here and Afyon is a popular stopping-place on these journeys. There are a number of well-established roadside restaurants for travellers to breakfast on the local cuisine. Some of these places are modern well-equipped hotels and spas; the mineral waters of Afyon are renowned for their healing qualities. There is also a long string of roadside kiosks selling the local Turkish delight. Afyon is also an important railroad junction between İzmir, [[Konya]], Ankara and Istanbul.
