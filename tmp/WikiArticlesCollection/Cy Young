'''Denton True''' "'''Cy'''" '''Young''' (March 29, 1867 – November 4, 1955) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]]. During his 21-year baseball career (1890–1911), he pitched for five different teams. Young established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for a century. Young compiled 511 [[Win (baseball)|wins]], which is [[List of Major League Baseball leaders in career wins|most in Major League history]] and 94 ahead of [[Walter Johnson]] who is second on the list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/pitching/piwins2.shtml |title=Career Leaders for Wins |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}</ref> Young was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1937.

One year after Young's death, the [[Cy Young Award]] was created to honor the previous season's best pitcher.

In addition to wins, Young still holds the major league records for most career [[innings pitched]] (7,355), most career games started (815), and most [[complete game]]s (749).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_ip.shtml |title=Innings Pitched Records |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_gams.shtml |title=Games Started Records |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_gamcg.shtml |title=Complete Games Records |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}</ref> He also retired with 316 [[Loss (baseball)|losses]], the most in MLB history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/loss-records.shtml |title=Games Lost Records |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}</ref> Young's 76 career shutouts are fourth all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/historical/leaders.jsp?c_id=mlb&baseballScope=mlb&statType=2&sortByStat=SHO&timeFrame=3&timeSubFrame2=0|title=Pitching Leaders, Career All Time|publisher=mlb.com|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref> He also won at least 30 games in a season five times, with ten other seasons of 20 or more wins.<ref name=stats>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/y/youngcy01.shtml |title=Cy Young Statistics |accessdate=2008-08-03 |work= |publisher=''baseball-reference.com'' |date= }}</ref> In addition, Young pitched three [[no-hitter]]s, including the third [[perfect game]] in baseball history, first in baseball's "modern era".{{ref label|A|a|none}} In 1999, 88 years after his final major league appearance and 44 years after his death, [[literary editor|editors]] at ''[[The Sporting News]]'' ranked Cy Young 14th on their list of "Baseball's 100 Greatest Players".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml |title=Baseball's 100 Greatest Players |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work=[[The Sporting News]] |date= }}</ref> That same year, baseball fans named him to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].

Young's career started in 1890 with the [[Cleveland Spiders]]. After eight years with the Spiders, Young was moved to [[1899 St. Louis Perfectos season|St. Louis]] in 1899. After two years there, Young jumped to the newly created [[American League]], joining the [[Boston Red Sox|Boston]] franchise. He was traded back to [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]] in 1909, before spending the final two months of his career with the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Rustlers]]. After his retirement, Young went back to his farm in [[Ohio]], where he stayed until his death at age 88 in 1955.

==Early life==
Cy Young was the oldest child born to McKinzie Young, Jr. and [[German American]] Nancy Miller. The couple had four more children: Carl, Lon, Ella, and Anthony. When the couple married, McKinzie's father gave him the {{convert|54|acre|m2}} of farm land he owned.<ref name=browning>{{cite book |last= Browning |first= Reed |coauthors= |title= Cy Young: A Baseball Life |publisher= Univ of Massachusetts Press |year= 2003 |month= |isbn= 1-55849-398-0}}</ref> Young was born in Gilmore, a tiny farming community located in [[Washington Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio]]. He was christened Denton True Young. Some sources later, and even today, list his middle name erroneously as "[[Tecumseh]]", apparently as a result of being nicknamed "The Chief" by teammates.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=SzIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=denton+tecumseh+young&source=bl&ots=UOgKvJLqQg&sig=pkSlWLT8xwL7rgGWbER-hT9xOEA&hl=en&ei=6HdIS6ibOZHOM92L5I8J&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=denton%20tecumseh%20young&f=false ''Baseball Digest'']. November 1975, p. 73.</ref>

He was raised on one of the local farms and went by the name Dent Young in his early years.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/biography.htm |title=Cy Young Biography |accessdate=2007-06-14 |publisher=[[CMG Worldwide]] |date= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070602024410/http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/biography.htm |archivedate = June 2, 2007}}</ref> Young was also known as "Farmer Young" and "Farmboy Young". Young stopped his formal education after he completed the [[sixth grade]]<ref name=dugout>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/dugout0e.shtml |title=Cy Young : A Life In Baseball |accessdate=2007-06-23 |work= Dr. Donald McKim |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}</ref> so he could help out on the family's farm. In 1885, Young moved with his father to [[Nebraska]], and in the summer of 1887, they returned to Gilmore.

Cy Young played for many amateur baseball leagues during his youth, including a "semi-pro" [[Carrollton, Ohio|Carrollton]] team in 1888. Young pitched and played second base. The first box score known containing the name Young came from that season. In that game, Young played first base and had three hits in three at-bats. After the season, Young received an offer to play for the minor league [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] team, which started Young's professional career.<ref name=browning/>

==Professional career==

===Before Major League Baseball===
Young began his professional career in 1889 with the [[Canton, Ohio]] team of the [[Tri-State League]], a professional minor league. During his tryout, Young impressed the scouts, recalling years later, "I almost tore the boards off the grandstand with my fast ball."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/deaths/cy_young_obituary.shtml |title=Cy Young Obituary |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1955-11-05 }}</ref> Cy Young's nickname came from the fences that he had destroyed using his fastball. The fences looked like a [[cyclone]] had hit them. Reporters later shortened the name to "Cy", which became the nickname Young used for the rest of his life.<ref name=bl>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Cy_Young_1867 |title=The Ballplayers - Cy Young  |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''baseball-library.com'' |date= }}</ref> During Young's one year with the Canton team, he won 15 games and lost 15.<ref name=bio/>

Franchises in the [[National League]], the major professional baseball league at the time, wanted the best players available to them. Therefore, in 1890, Young signed with the [[Cleveland Spiders]], a team which had moved up from the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] to the National League the previous year.

===Cleveland Spiders===
On August 6, 1890, Young's major league debut, he pitched a three-hit [[Shutouts in baseball|shutout]].<ref name=1890chron>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1890#August |title=1890 Chronology |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''baseball-library.com'' |date= }}</ref> While Young was on the Spiders, [[Chief Zimmer]] was his catcher more often than any other player. [[Bill James]], a baseball [[statistician]], estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more games than any other [[Battery (baseball)|battery]] in baseball history.<ref name=abstract>James, Bill. ''The New Bill James Historical Abstract'' (Simon & Schuster, 2001), pp. 410–411</ref>

Early on, Young established himself as one of the harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his [[baseball glove]] to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball.<ref name=abstract/> In the absence of [[radar gun]]s, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On the last day of the season, Young won both games of a doubleheader.<ref name=dugout/> In the first weeks of Young's career, [[Cap Anson]], the player-manager of the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Colts]] spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager [[Gus Schmelz]], "He's too green to do your club much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1890|r=0}}}} today) for him." Schmelz replied, "Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube."<ref name=quotes>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/quotes.htm |title=Cy Young: Quotes |accessdate=2008-07-27 |publisher=[[CMG Worldwide]] |date= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071229062724/http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/quotes.htm |archivedate = December 29, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Cy Young 1893.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A 1893 baseball card of Young]]
Two years after Young's debut, the National League moved the [[Baseball field#Pitcher's mound|pitcher's position]] back by {{convert|5|ft|m}}. Since 1881, pitchers had pitched within a "box" whose front line was {{convert|50|ft|m}} from home base, and since 1887 they had been compelled to toe the back line of the box when delivering the ball. The back line was {{convert|55|ft|6|in|m}} away from home. In 1893, {{convert|5|ft|m}} was added to the back line, yielding the modern pitching distance of {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}}. In the book ''[[The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers]]'', [[Sports journalism|sports journalist]] [[Rob Neyer]] wrote that the speed with which pitchers like Cy Young, [[Amos Rusie]], and [[Jouett Meekin]] threw was the impetus that caused the move.<ref name=guide>{{cite book | last=Neyer | first=Rob | coauthors=Bill James | title=[[The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers]] | publisher=Fireside | year=2004 | pages=496 | month=June | isbn=0-7432-6158-5 }}</ref>

The 1892 regular season was a success for Young, who led the National League in wins (36), ERA (1.93), and shutouts (9). Just as many contemporary Minor League Baseball leagues operate today, the National League was using a [[split season]] format during the 1892 season.<ref name=1892spiders>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n20_v216/ai_14655929 |title=Of double seasons, Spiders and no fall stakes |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work=Steve Gietschier |work=[[The Sporting News]] |date=1993-11-15 }}</ref> The [[Atlanta Braves#Boston|Boston Beaneaters]] won the first-half title, and the Spiders won the second-half title, with a best-of-nine series determining the league champion. Despite the Spiders' second half run, the Beaneaters swept the series, five games to none. Young pitched three complete games in the series, but lost two decisions. He also threw a complete game shutout, but the game ended in a 0&ndash;0 tie.

The Spiders faced the [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]] in the [[Temple Cup]], a precursor to the [[World Series]], in 1895. Young won three games in the series and Cleveland won the Cup, four games to one. It was around this time that Young added what he called a "slow ball" to his pitching repertoire to reduce stress on his arm. The pitch today is called a [[changeup]].<ref name=dugout/>

In 1896, Young lost a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning when [[Ed Delahanty]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] hit a single.<ref name=1896chron>{{Cite web| title=1896 Chronology | work=baseball-library.com | url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1896#July | accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref> On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first [[no-hitter]] of his career in a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders committed four [[Error (baseball)|errors]] while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a [[Hit (baseball)|hit]], but the Cleveland [[third baseman]] sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said, that, despite his teammate's gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.<ref name=1897chron>{{Cite web| title=1897 Chronology | work=baseball-library.com | url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1897#September | accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref>

===Shift to St. Louis===
Prior to the 1899 season, Frank Robison, the Spiders owner, bought the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]], thus owning two clubs simultaneously. The Browns were renamed the "Perfectos", and restocked with Cleveland talent. Just weeks before the season opener, most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St. Louis, including fellow pitcher [[Pete McBride]] and three future Hall of Famers: Young, [[Jesse Burkett]], and [[Bobby Wallace (baseball)|Bobby Wallace]].<ref name=perfectos>{{cite web |url=http://www.wcnet.org/~dlfleitz/cleve.htm |title=The 1899 Cleveland Spiders |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work=David Fleitz |publisher=''wcnet.org'' |date= }}</ref> The roster maneuvers failed to create a powerhouse Perfectos team, as St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and 1900. Meanwhile, the depleted Spiders lost 134 games, the most in MLB history, before folding. Young spent two years with St. Louis, which is where he found his favorite catcher, [[Lou Criger]]. The two men were teammates for a decade.<ref name=dugout/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/cy-young-award |title=Biography:Cy Young |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''answers.com'' |date= }}</ref>

===Move to the American League===
[[File:Cy Young.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Young in 1902]]
In 1901, the rival [[American League]] declared major league status and set about raiding National League rosters. Young left St. Louis and joined the American League's [[History of the Boston Red Sox|Boston Americans]] for a $3,500 contract (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3500|1901|r=0}}}} today). Young would remain with the Boston team until 1909. In his first year in the American League, Young was dominant. Pitching to Criger, who had also jumped to Boston, Young led the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA{{ref label|B|b|none}}, thus earning the colloquial [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown#American League|AL Triple Crown]] for pitchers.<ref name=stats/> Young won almost 42% of his team's games in 1901, accounting for 33 of his team's 79 wins.<ref name="Chronology">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php? |title=Cy Young from the Chronology |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''baseball-library.com'' |date= }}</ref> In February 1902, before the start of the baseball season, Young served as a pitching coach at [[Harvard University]]. The sixth-grade graduate instructing Harvard students delighted Boston newspapers.<ref name=dugout/> The following year, Young coached at [[Mercer University]] during the spring. The team went on to win the Georgia state championship in 1903, 1904, and 1905.<ref>Spright Dowell, A History of Mercer University, 1833–1953 (Macon, Ga.: Mercer University, [1958][http://ourcollegetown.net/index.php?main_page=page&id=4#12]).</ref>

The Boston Americans played the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the first modern [[World Series]] in 1903. Young, who started [[1903 World Series#Game 1|Game One]] against the visiting Pirates, thus threw the first pitch in modern World Series history. The Pirates scored four runs in that first inning, and Young lost the game. Young performed better in subsequent games, winning his next two starts. He also drove in three runs in [[1903 World Series#Game 5|Game Five]]. Young finished the series with a 2&ndash;1 record and a 1.85 ERA in four appearances, and Boston defeated Pittsburgh, five games to three games.

{{main|Cy Young's perfect game}}
After one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] pitcher [[Rube Waddell]] taunted Young to face him so that he could repeat his performance against Boston's ace. Three days later, Young pitched a [[perfect game]] against Waddell and the Athletics.{{ref label|A|a2|none}} It was the first perfect game in American League history.{{ref label|A|a3|none}}<ref name=bbhof>{{Cite web| title=Hall of Fame profile | work=baseballhalloffame.org | url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=124692 | accessdate=2007-06-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013200502/http://baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=124692 |archivedate = October 13, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/boxscore/05051904.shtml |title=Cy Young Perfect Game Box Score |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}</ref> Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, "How do you like that, you hayseed?" Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 25.1 innings, or 76 hitless batters.<ref>{{cite news |title=Clarifying Some of the Records* |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] |url=http://research.sabr.org/journals/clarifying-some-of-the-records |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60gDS0c9R |archivedate=April 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Peticca |first=Mike |title=No-hitters: Did you ever attend a record-book type major league game?

Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games.{{ref label|A|a3|none}} This occurred in 1880, when [[Lee Richmond]] and [[John Montgomery Ward]] pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher's box was only {{convert|45|ft|m}} from home base (the modern release point is about {{convert|10|ft|m}} farther away); walks required eight [[Strike zone|balls]]; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 4&ndash;2, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: "For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in."<ref name=waddell>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaathletics.org/history/rubevscy.htm |title=Waddell vs Young |accessdate=2007-06-23 |work=By Daniel O’Brien |publisher=''philadelphiaathletics.org''|date= }}</ref> In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.

[[File:Cy young.jpg|thumb|left|125px|A 1911 baseball card of Young]]
In 1908, Young pitched the third no-hitter of his career. Three months past his 41st birthday, Cy Young was the oldest pitcher to record a no-hitter, a record which would stand 82 years until 43-year-old [[Nolan Ryan]] surpassed the feat. Only a walk kept Young from his second perfect game. After that runner was caught stealing, no other batter reached base. At this time, Young was the second-oldest player in either league. In another game one month before his no-hitter, he allowed just one single while facing 28 batters.<ref name="Chronology"/> On August 13, 1908, the league celebrated "Cy Young Day." No American League games were played on that day, and a group of All-Stars from the league's other teams gathered in Boston to play against Young and the Red Sox.<ref>{{cite web| title = Cy Young Day | work = brainyhistory.com | url=http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1908/august_13_1908_72365.html | accessdate = 2006-11-11 }}</ref> When the season ended, he posted a 1.26 ERA, which gave him not only the lowest in his career, but also gave him a Major League record of being the oldest pitcher with 150+ innings pitched to post a season ERA under 1.50.

===Cleveland Naps and retirement===
Young was traded back to Cleveland, the place where he played over half his career, before the 1909 season, to the [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland Naps]] of the American League. The following season, 1910, he won his 500th career game on July 19 against Washington.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1910&t=CL9][http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F10915FA395D11738DDDAD0A94DF405B808DF1D3 NY Times article "Cy Young's Great Record"]</ref> He split 1911, his final year, between the Naps and the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Rustlers]].

On September 22, 1911, Young shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates, 1&ndash;0, for his last career victory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1911/B09220PIT1911.htm |title=Boston Rustlers 1, Pittsburgh Pirates 0 |accessdate=2008-08-03 |work= |publisher=''retrosheet.com'' |date= }}</ref> In his final start two weeks later, the last eight batters of Young's career combined to hit a [[Triple (baseball)|triple]], four [[Single (baseball)|singles]], and three [[Double (baseball)|doubles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1911/B10062BRO1911.htm |title=Brooklyn Superbas 13, Boston Rustlers 3 (2) |accessdate=2008-08-03 |work= |publisher=''retrosheet.com'' |date= }}</ref>

[[File:Cy Young etc 1912.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Young (far left) with (L to R) [[Jake Stahl]], [[Bill Carrigan]] and [[Michael T. McGreevy]] during spring training in 1912.]]
From 1912 until his death in 1955, Cy Young lived and worked on his farm. In 1913, he served as manager of the [[Cleveland Green Sox]] of the [[Federal League]], which was at the time an outlaw minor league. However, he never worked in baseball after that.

Young's wife, Robba, whom he had known since childhood, died in 1933.<ref name=browning/><ref name=dugout/> After she died, Young tried several jobs, and eventually moved in with friends John and Ruth Benedum and did odd jobs for them. Young took part in many baseball events after his retirement.<ref name=dugout/> In 1937, 26 years after he retired from baseball, Cy Young was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was among the first to donate mementos to the Hall.

On November 4, 1955, Cy Young died on his farm at the age of 88. He was buried in [[Peoli, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Cy Young | work = retrosheet.com | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/Y/Pyounc102.htm | accessdate = 2006-11-11 }}</ref>

==Baseball legacy==
Young retired with 511 career wins, which remains the record for most career wins by a pitcher. At the time, [[Pud Galvin]] had the second most career wins with 364. [[Walter Johnson]], then in his fourth season, finished his career with 417 wins and, as of 2012, remains second on the list. In 1921, Johnson broke Young's career record for strikeouts.<ref>SABR, p.210, ISBN 978-1-4165-3245-3 Retrieved on 2008-08-03</ref>

Cy Young's career is seen as a bridge from baseball's earliest days to its modern era; he pitched against stars such as [[Cap Anson]], already an established player when the [[National League]] was first formed in 1876, as well as against [[Eddie Collins]], who played until 1930. When Young's career began, pitchers delivered the baseball underhand and fouls were not counted as strikes. The pitcher's mound was not moved back to its present position of {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}} until Young's fourth season; he did not wear a glove until his sixth season.<ref name=dugout/>

Young led his league in wins five times (1892, 1895, and 1901&ndash;1903), finishing second twice. His career high was 36 in 1892. He had fifteen seasons with twenty or more wins, two more than the runners-up, [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Warren Spahn]]. Young won two [[Earned run average|ERA]] titles during his career, in 1892 (1.93) and in 1901 (1.62), and was three times the runner-up. Young's earned run average was below 2.00 six times, but this was not uncommon during the [[dead-ball era]]. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice (with 140 in 1896, and 158 in 1901), and in shutouts seven times.<ref name=stats/> Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings thirteen times and finished second one season. Only twice in his 22-year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category. Although the [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]] ratio was not calculated until well after Young's death, Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times.<ref name=stats/> Cy Young is tied with [[Roger Clemens]] for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher. They each won 192 games while with the franchise.<ref name=redsoxleaders>{{Cite web| title=Boston Red Sox All-Time Leaders | work=mlb.com | url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/stats/historical/player_stats.jsp?c_id=bos&baseballScope=BOS&teamPosCode=all&statType=2&sitSplit=&venueID=&timeFrame=3&timeSubFrame2=0&Submit=Submit&timeSubFrame=0&&sortByStat=W | accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

Particularly after his fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. Young was once quoted as saying, "Some may have thought it was essential to know how to curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control."<ref name=quotes /> In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury. For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Cy Young was in his leagues' top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games.<ref name=1897chron /> By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in [[spring training]]. "I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it", said Young, "and there wasn't any use wasting them." Young once described his approach before a game:
<blockquote>"I never warmed up ten, fifteen minutes before a game like most pitchers do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day."<ref name=quotes /></blockquote>

By the time of his retirement, Young's control had faltered. Young had also gained weight.<ref name=dugout/> In three of his last four years, he was the oldest player in the league.<ref name=stats/>

In 1956, about one year after Young's death, the Cy Young Award was created. The first award was given to Brooklyn's [[Don Newcombe]]. Originally, it was a single award covering the whole of baseball. The honor was divided into two Cy Young Awards in 1967, one for each league.

On September 23, 1993, a statue dedicated to him was unveiled by [[Northeastern University]] on the site of the Red Sox's original stadium, the [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]]. It was there that Young had pitched the first game of the 1903 World Series, as well as the first perfect game in the modern era of baseball.  A home plate-shaped plaque next to the statue reads:
<blockquote>
"On October 1, 1903 the first modern World Series between the American League champion Boston Pilgrims (later known as the Red Sox) and the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates was played on this site. General admission tickets were fifty cents. The Pilgrims, led by twenty-eight game winner Cy Young, trailed the series three games to one but then swept four consecutive victories to win the championship five games to three."<ref>{{cite news|author=Boston's Pastime|title=Huntington Avenue Grounds: The Pre-Fenway Era |url=http://www.bostonspastime.com/stories/huntington.html|accessdate=200-05-20 }}</ref>

==Notes==
* '''a.'''{{note label|A|a|none}}{{ref label|A|a2|none}}{{ref label|A|a3|none}} Although the phrase "perfect game" appeared in record books as early as 1922, and was a common expression years before that, Major League Baseball did not formalize the definition of a "perfect game" until 1991, long after Young's death. Nonetheless, Young's 1955 obituary also used the phrase.
::''"An official perfect game occurs when a pitcher (or pitchers) retires each batter on the opposing team during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings. In a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game."''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/rules_regulations.jsp |title=The Official Site of Major League Baseball: Official Info: Rules, regulations and statistics |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''mlb.com'' |date= }}</ref>
* '''b.'''{{note label|B|b|none}}Although not an actual award, many baseball fans and experts call a pitcher who leads his league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA the [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] winner.
