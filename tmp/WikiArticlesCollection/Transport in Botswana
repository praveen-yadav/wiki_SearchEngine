A sparsely populated, arid country, '''[[Botswana]]''' has nonetheless managed to incorporate much of its interior into the national economy.  An "inner circle" [[highway]] connecting all major towns and district capitals is completely paved, and the all-weather Trans-Kalahari Highway connects the country (and, through it, [[South Africa]]'s commercially dominant [[Gauteng Province]]) to [[Walvis Bay]] in [[Namibia]].

==Railways==
{{Main|Botswana Railways}}
Botswana possesses 888&nbsp;km of {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge railway, by 2002 figures, serving a number of towns and connecting the country to its neighbours.

All passenger services have been suspended in Botswana, with the only remaining service being an international link to Zimbabwe from Francistown, the only railway station that is still in service. Freight trains still operate.

==Highways==

Botswana possesses 10,217&nbsp;km of [[highway]], of which 5,620&nbsp;km are paved.  Since 1996 estimates, there has been a significant reduction in the total length of unpaved highway in Botswana - between 1996 and 1999 total length of unpaved highway fell from 14,139&nbsp;km to 4,597&nbsp;km.

Traditionally, [[road signs in Botswana]] used blue backgrounds rather than the yellow, white, or orange which the rest of the world uses on traffic [[warning sign]]s. In the early 2010s, officials announced plans to begin phasing out the distinctive blue signs in favor of more typical signs in order to be more in line with the neighboring [[Southern African Development Community]] member states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://72.167.255.126/index.php?sid=1&aid=821&dir=2011/December/Wednesday21|title=Old road signs are being phased out|author="Mmegi Online" staff writer Maranyane Ngwanaamotho|date=Dec 21, 2011|accessdate=Oct 5, 2012}}</ref>

==Airports==
{{Further|List of airports in Botswana}}
In 2004 there were an estimated 85 airports, 10 of which (as of 2005), were paved. The government-owned [[Air Botswana]] operates scheduled flights to [[Francistown]], [[Gaborone]], [[Maun]], and [[Selebi-Phikwe]]. There is international service to [[Johannesburg, South Africa]]; [[Mbabane, Swaziland]]; and [[Harare, Zimbabwe]]. A new international airport near Gaborone was opened in 1984. Air passengers arriving to and departing from Botswana during 2003 totalled about 183,000.
