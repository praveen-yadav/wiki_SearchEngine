[[File:Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick.JPG|thumb|right|The original UK 45rpm single picture sleeve of [[Ian Dury and the Blockheads]]  "[[Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick]]" designed by Barney Bubbles]]

'''Barney Bubbles''' (born Colin Fulcher, 30 July 1942 – 14 November 1983) was a radical English [[graphic artist]] whose work encompassed [[graphic design]] and music video direction. Bubbles, who also sketched and painted privately, is best known for his distinctive contribution to the design practices associated with the British independent music scene of the 1970s and 1980s. His record sleeves, laden with symbols and riddles, were his most recognisable output.

==Early life==
Fulcher was born in Tranmere Road, [[Whitton, London|Whitton]], [[Middlesex]] (now Greater London), in July 1942. He attended [[Isleworth and Syon School|Isleworth Grammar School]]. In 1958 he embarked on a retail display course for a National Diploma in Design (NDD) at the art school of [[Richmond upon Thames College|Twickenham College of Technology]].<ref>[[Reasons To Be Cheerful]]: The Life & Work Of Barney Bubbles, Paul Gorman (Adelita 2008) ISBN 978-0-9552017-3-8</ref> During his five years at the college Fulcher received a multi-disciplinary education that included training in cardboard design, display and packaging, exploited later in his record sleeve work.

==Career==

===Michael Tucker + Associates===
After leaving college in 1963 Fulcher worked as an assistant at the design company Michael Tucker + Associates in London.<ref name="The Life 2010">[[Reasons To Be Cheerful]]: The Life & Work Of Barney Bubbles, 2nd edition, Paul Gorman (Adelita 2010) ISBN 978-0-9552017-4-5</ref> Its clients included [[Pirelli]]. In a rare interview in 1981<ref>[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]: November 1981</ref> Bubbles described Tucker's discipline as "very Swiss; very hard; unjustified; very grey. He taught me everything about typography." Tucker's studio produced the posters for [[Hugh Hudson]]'s Pirelli-sponsored film The Tortoise & The Hare (1967), for which Fulcher designed the poster lettering on a freelance basis.<ref name="The Life 2010"/>

===The Conran Group===
In May 1965 Fulcher was recruited by The Conran Group as senior graphic designer alongside [[Stafford Cliff]], [[Virginia Clive-Smith]] and [[John Muggeridge]]. He produced a variety of commercial commissions for Conran, including the Norman-style archer logo for [[Strongbow cider]] and items for Conran's new homewares chain [[Habitat]]. Fulcher also established an association with [[Justin de Blank]], a director at Conran, which blossomed when de Blank left to launch his own upmarket provisions company and restaurant business in 1968.

===A1 Good Guyz and other early activities===

Between 1965 and 1966 Fulcher organised happenings, parties and other events under the name ''A1 Good Guyz'' with two graduates of Twickenham Art College, David Wills and Roy Burge.

In 1967 Fulcher became known as Barney Bubbles, though he did not change his name by [[deed poll]] for several more years. The name came about when Fulcher was operating a light show that created a bubble effect by mixing oils and water on projection slides. These lightshows were for groups including [[The Gun (band)|The Gun]] and [[Quintessence (English band)|Quintessence]] at underground venues including [[The Roundhouse]], [[Jim Haynes]]'s Drury Lane [[Arts Lab]], the [[Electric Cinema]] and [[Middle Earth]].

With Wills, Bubbles undertook freelance design commissions, including a redesign of ''Motor Racing'' magazine and a recipe book for the English Egg Marketing Board. With a team of contributors Bubbles and Wills art-directed [[Oz (magazine)|Oz]] magazine issue 12, dubbed ''The Tax Dodge Special''  and published in May 1968.

===Teenburger Designs===

Early in 1969 Bubbles took the lease on a three-storey building at 307 Portobello Road in Notting Hill Gate, West London. He converted the ground -floor space into a graphic art studio, which he named Teenburger Designs. With a business association established with two entrepreneurs, Edward Molton and Stephen Warwick, and with [[John Muggeridge]] from Conran serving briefly as an assistant, he set about working primarily for the music industry. His first record sleeve design was for [[Quintessence (English band)|Quintessence]]'s LP ''[[In Blissful Company]]'' (1969). The gatefold sleeve design uses illustrations by Gopala on the front and back, and contains a monochrome glued-in booklet inside.

Teenburger also provided record sleeve designs for the bands [[Brinsley Schwarz]] and [[Red Dirt (band)|Red Dirt]], as well as [[Vertigo Records|Vertigo]] artists such as [[Cressida (progressive rock band)|Cressida]], [[Gracious!]] and Dr Z, whose LP ''Three Parts To My Soul'' is particularly noted for its complex and colourful fold-out sleeve.

Following the closure of Teenburger in 1970 as a result of the disappearance of Molton and Warwick, Bubbles worked as the designer of the underground newspaper [[Friends (magazine)|Friends]] (later renamed Frendz).<ref>Days in the Life: Voices from the English Underground, 1961-1971, Jonathon Green (Pimlico 1998) ISBN 978-0-7126-6665-7</ref>

===Hawkwind (and other 1970s rock)===
[[File:In Search of Space - Hawkwind.jpg|thumb|left|The original UK LP sleeve of [[Hawkwind]]'s ''[[X In Search of Space]]'' designed by Barney Bubbles]]

While he was working at Friends Bubbles formed an association with [[Hawkwind]] and became responsible for a run of their album sleeves, including ''[[X In Search of Space]]'', ''[[Doremi Fasol Latido]]'' and ''[[Space Ritual]]''. Bubbles engaged in many aspects of the group's visual identity, titling releases and designing posters, adverts, stage decoration and performance plans, some of which were adorned with mystical and mock-Teutonic insignia. In 1972 Bubbles produced the triple LP package [[Glastonbury Fayre]]. This comprised a six-panel fold-out card sleeve, two poster inserts, a booklet and a cut-out and build miniature pyramid, housed in a clear vinyl bag (with two sleeve variations and three label variations).

From 1973 onwards Bubbles increasingly avoided credits for his artwork, typically working anonymously or occasionally adopting alternative pseudonyms. During this period he designed album sleeves and additional material for such acts as The [[Sutherland Brothers]], [[Kevin Coyne]], [[Edgar Broughton Band]], [[Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers]], [[Quiver (Rock band)|Quiver]], the [[Kursaal Flyers]] and [[Michael Moorcock|Michael Moorcock and the Deep Fix]].

In 1976 his design relationship with Hawkwind came to an end. It was rekindled once, in 1978, for the [[Hawklords]] spin-off, but otherwise continued only with design commissions for projects involving the band's saxophonist [[Nik Turner]].

===Stiff, Radar and F Beat (and other punk and New Wave)===
[[File:Carlenecest.jpg|thumb|right|The original UK LP sleeve of [[Carlene Carter]]'s ''[[C'est C Bon]] '' designed by Barney Bubbles]]
Barney Bubbles joined [[Stiff Records]] as designer and art director early in 1977. With the label's co-founder [[Jake Riviera]] he generated a body of creative work that helped to secure Stiff's reputation as an exciting new independent label. Bubbles created sleeves for bands including [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Ian Dury]] and [[Wreckless Eric]]. Often these were accompanied by quirky logos such as the face logo for [[Ian Dury#The Blockheads|Blockhead]], advertisements and promotional items. The marketing of [[Elvis Costello]]'s ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' included advertisements in three UK music papers from which a poster of Costello could be constructed, and the first 1,000 pressings contained an insert headed ''Help Us Hype Elvis'', which, if completed and returned to Stiff, ensured that a friend would received a free copy.

When Riviera left Stiff in late 1977 Bubbles joined him at his new label [[Radar Records]] and later at Riviera's [[F-Beat Records]]. Bubbles created designs for artists such as [[Elvis Costello]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Carlene Carter]] and [[Clive Langer]] & The Boxes.

Bubbles also maintained his freelance output, producing designs for [[Peter Jenner]] ([[Ian Dury]] and [[Billy Bragg]]'s manager), and others, creating a prodigious output by working for such bands, musicians and performers as [[Vivian Stanshall]], [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]], [[Big Star]], [[Johnny Moped]], [[Whirlwind]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Clover (band)|Clover]], [[The Sinceros]], [[Roger Chapman]], [[Phillip Goodhand-Tait]], [[Dr. Feelgood]], [[Inner City Unit]] and [[The Psychedelic Furs]]. As a result his work appeared on releases by labels such as Aura, [[Chiswick]], [[Utility]], [[Go! Discs]], [[Epic Records|Epic]], [[Charisma]], [[CBS]], [[Line Records]], [[United Artists Records|United Artists]] and [[Riddle Records]]. His signature style emerged as one that was colourful, playful, loaded with geometry, art-history and music-history references, jokes, cryptograms and symbols. The overriding appetite was for going against the grain of accepted design standards. His work is simultaneously complex in meaning and simple in its delivery. Examples include:

* [[Elvis Costello]] - ''[[This Year's Model]]'', which was designed to have a deliberate miscropping so that the entire design was off-register;
* [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] - ''[[Damned Damned Damned]]'', a limited number of which were deliberately printed with a photo of Eddie and the Hot Rods on the back of the cover, rather than The Damned playing at The Roxy Club, and with an erratum sticker apologising for this "mistake", and on the front of the LP, on top of the original shrinkwrap, a red food-fight sticker saying 'Damned Damned', thus completing the LP's title when read underneath the band's name;
* Elvis Costello - ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]'', with an extended back panel consisting of folding flaps,  postcards carrying the instruction ''DON'T JOIN'' (advice against joining the armed forces), and a message that these postcards had been die-cut from the rest of the sleeve;
* [[Ian Dury and the Blockheads]] - ''[[Do It Yourself (Ian Dury)|Do It Yourself]]'', which was released in 28 sleeve variations, all of which were designs supplied by [[Crown Wallpaper]].

===Music promo videos===
Barney Bubbles directed several videos, including [[The Specials]]' "[[Ghost Town (song)|Ghost Town]]", [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]]'s "[[Is That Love]]" and "[[Tempted (Squeeze song)|Tempted]]", [[Elvis Costello]]'s "[[Clubland (song)|Clubland]]" and "[[New Lace Sleeves]]", and [[Fun Boy Three]]'s "[[The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum)]]". Two promos for the punk act [[Johnny Moped]], "Incendiary Device" and "Darling Let's Have Another Baby", were never commercially released to broadcasters.

“A good video can sell a record which might not do so well," Bubbles told [[Smash Hits]] magazine in 1982.<ref>http://www.flickr.com/photos/51106326@N00/6442288427/in/set-72157628248724685/</ref> "The record companies know that. I think Chrysalis would agree that The Specials’ Ghost Town video helped sales a good deal. This year I intend to make videos which are really inexpensive but really inventive. It can be done, you know."

===Other work===
In 1978 Barney Bubbles was responsible for the redesign of the weekly music paper the [[NME]], including a new logo design (which is no longer in use).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinmag.com/online/gbu0-display/nme.html|title=NME The Inside Story|accessdate=16 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080513215310/http://www.vinmag.com/online/gbu0-display/nme.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 May 2008}}</ref>

In 1979 [[Derek Boshier]] curated an exhibition entitled Lives at the [[Hayward Gallery]], London. He commissioned Bubbles to design the catalogue and poster. Together with the photographer [[Chris Gabrin]], Bubbles also exhibited a video and mixed-media installation in the exhibition.

In the early 1980s Bubbles created furniture designs, some of which were featured in [[The Face (magazine)|The Face]], November 1981.

In 1982 Bubbles conceived the album ''Ersatz'', working primarily with [[Nik Turner]] and other musicians from [[Inner City Unit]]. The LP was released under the name of The Imperial Pompadours.

Bubbles painted privately, increasingly in the early 1980s.

==Death==
Barney Bubbles committed [[suicide]] in London on 14 November 1983 by gassing himself, trapping the fumes in a plastic bag he placed over his head.<ref name="Mark Hodkinson">{{Cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018wh7h |publisher=BBC Radio 4  | title=In Search of Barney Bubbles | first=Mark |last=Hodkinson | date=2 January 2012}}</ref> He had considerable personal and financial worries. His sleeves were being rejected by musicians, such as Elvis Costello, and by record companies, and he was being chased by the [[Inland Revenue]] for unpaid taxes dating back many years.<ref name="Sleep Till Canvey Island 2000">No Sleep Till Canvey Island: The Great Pub Rock Revolution, Will Birch (Virgin Books 2000, 2003) ISBN 0-7535-0740-4</ref> He suffered from [[bipolar disorder]],<ref>Carol Clerk.
