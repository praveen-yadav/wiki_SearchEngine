The '''common chimpanzee''' (''Pan troglodytes''), also known as the '''robust chimpanzee''', is a species of [[Hominidae|great ape]]. Colloquially, the common chimpanzee is often called the [[chimpanzee]] (or "chimp"), though this term can be used to refer to both [[species]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'': the common chimpanzee and the closely related [[bonobo]], formerly called the pygmy chimpanzee. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing show both species of chimpanzees are the [[sister taxon|sister group]] to the modern [[Human evolution|human lineage]].

The common chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It is considered more [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] than the bonobo, weighing between {{convert|40|and|65|kg|abbr=on}} and measuring approximately {{convert|1.3|to|1.6|m|abbr=on}} from head to tail. Its [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several more years; it reaches [[puberty]] at the age of eight to 10, and its lifespan in captivity is about 50 years.

The common chimpanzee lives in groups which range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a male-dominated, strict hierarchy, which means disputes can generally be settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools, modifying sticks, rocks, grass, and leaves and use them for acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts, and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear [[Senegal bushbaby|Senegal bushbabies]] out of small holes in trees.

The common chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range in the forests and savannahs of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]]. The biggest threats to the common chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching and disease.

==Etymology==
The species name ''troglodytes'', Greek for "cave-dweller", was coined by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] in his book ''De generis humani varietate nativa liber'' ("[Book] on the natural varieties of the human genus") published in 1776,<ref>p. 37 in Blumenbach, J. F. 1776. De generis hvmani varietate nativa liber. Cvm figvris aeri incisis. – pp. [1], 1–100, [1], Tab. I-II [= 1–2]. Goettingae.

The English name ''chimpanzee'' came from a [[Bantu language]] of [[Angola]].<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chimpanzee Chimpanzee]. Online Etymology Dictionary: Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2013-04-18.</ref>

== Evolutionary history ==
Despite a large number of ''[[Homo]]'' fossil finds, chimpanzee fossils (genus ''Pan'') were not described until 2005. Existing chimpanzee populations in West and Central Africa do not overlap with the major human fossil sites in East Africa. However, chimpanzee fossils have now been reported from Kenya. This would indicate that both humans and members of the ''Pan'' clade were present in the [[East African Rift]] Valley during the Middle Pleistocene.

According to John Gribbin and Jeremy Cherfas in their books ''The Monkey Puzzle: Reshaping the Evolutionary Tree'' and ''The First Chimpanzee: In Search of Human Origins'', chimps and bonobos may be descended from ''[[Australopithecus]]''. Chimpanzees were amongst the animals affected during the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba eruption]], hinting that Toba ash extended far west as Africa.

===Taxonomy===
DNA evidence suggests the bonobo and common chimpanzee species separated from each other less than one million years ago (similar in relation between ''Homo sapiens'' and [[Neanderthal]]s).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Won YJ, Hey J |title=Divergence population genetics of chimpanzees |journal=Mol.

Both its thumbs and big toes are opposable, allowing a precise grip.

==Ecology==
[[File:Gombe Stream NP Beute.jpg|thumb|250px|Chimpanzee in a tree with a kill.]]
The common chimpanzee is a highly adaptable species. It lives in a variety of habitats, including dry savanna, evergreen rainforest, montane forest, swamp forest, and dry woodland-savanna mosaic.<ref name=Poulsen2004>{{cite journal | author = Poulsen JR, Clark CJ | year = 2004 | title = Densities, distributions, and seasonal movements of gorillas and chimpanzees in swamp forest in northern Congo | journal = Int J Prim | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 285–306 | doi = 10.1023/B:IJOP.0000019153.50161.58 }}</ref><ref name=Goodall1986/> In [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe]], the chimpanzee lives in subalpine moorland, open woodland, semideciduous forest, evergreen forest, and grassland with scattered trees.<ref name=Goodall1986/> At [[Bossou]], the chimpanzee inhabits multistage secondary deciduous forests, which have grown after [[shifting cultivation]], as well as primary forests and grasslands.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sugiyama Y, Koman J | year = 1987 | title = A preliminary list of chimpanzees' alimentation at Bossou, Guinea | journal = Primates | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 133–47 | doi = 10.1007/BF02382192 }}</ref> At [[Taï National Park|Taï]], it can be found in the last remaining tropical rainforest in [[Côte d'Ivoire]].<ref name=Boesch2000>Boesch C, Boesch-Achermann H.

===Diet and foraging===
[[File:Gombe Stream NP Jungtier fressend.jpg|thumb|170px|Chimpanzee eating fruit.]]
The chimpanzee is an [[omnivorous]] [[frugivore]]. It prefers fruit above all other food items and will even seek out and eat them when they are not abundant. It will also eat leaves and leaf buds. Seeds, blossoms, stems, pith, bark and resin, insects and meat make up the rest of its diet.<ref name=Goodall1986/><ref>{{cite web|last=Guernsey|first=Paul|title=WHAT DO CHIMPS EAT?|url=http://www.allaboutwildlife.com/what-do-chimps-eat|work=All About Wildlife|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref> While the common chimpanzee is mostly [[herbivorous]], it does eat honey, soil, insects, birds and their eggs, and small to medium-sized mammals, including other primates.<ref name=Goodall1986/><ref>Isabirye-Basuta G. (1989) "Feeding ecology of chimpanzees in the Kibale Forest, Uganda", pp. 116–27 in: Heltne PG, Marquardt LA (eds.). ''Understanding chimpanzees''. Cambridge, (MS): Harvard Univ Press, ISBN 0674920910.</ref> The [[western red colobus]] ranks at the top of preferred mammal prey.

Cambridge, England: Cambridge Univ Press, ISBN 0521006139.</ref>

When hunting small monkeys such as the red colobus, the chimpanzee hunts where the forest canopy is interrupted or irregular.<ref name=Leipzig2002>{{cite journal | author = Leipzig G | year = 2002 | title = Cooperative hunting roles among Taï chimpanzees| journal = Human Nature | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 27–46 | doi = 10.1007/s12110-002-1013-6 }}</ref> This allows it to easily corner the monkeys when chasing them in the appropriate direction. Chimps may also hunt as a coordinated team, so that they can corner their prey even in a continuous canopy.<ref name=Leipzig2002/> During an [[arboreal]] hunt, each chimp in the hunting groups has a role. "Drivers" serve to keep the prey running in a certain direction and follow them without attempting to make a catch. "Blockers" are stationed at the bottom of the trees and will climb up to block prey that take off an a different direction. "Chasers" move quickly and try to make a catch. Finally, "ambushers" hide and position themselves where no prey had reached yet and rush out when a monkey nears.<ref name=Leipzig2002/> Both adult and infants are taken. However, adult male black-and-white colobus monkeys will attack the hunting chimps. In Gombe, the chimpanzee also fears adult colobus monkeys.<ref name=Goodall1986/> It prefers to snatch infants from their mother's bellies without harming the mothers. Male chimps hunt more than females. When caught and killed, the meal is distributed to all hunting party members and even bystanders.<ref name=Leipzig2002/>

Despite the fact that common chimpanzees are known to hunt, and to collect insects and other invertebrates, such food actually makes up a small portion of their diet; from as little as two percent yearly to as much as 65 grams of meat per day for each adult chimpanzee in peak hunting seasons. This also varies from troop to troop and year to year. However, in all cases the majority of their diet consists of fruits, leaves, roots and other plant matter.<ref>http://www.allaboutwildlife.com/what-do-chimps-eat</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford|first=Craig|title=The Predatory Behavior and Ecology of Wild Chimpanzees|url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~stanford/chimphunt.html|publisher=USC|accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref>

==Behavior==

===Group structure===
[[File:Gombe Stream NP gegenseitiges Lausen.jpg|thumb|250px|Chimpanzees grooming one another.]]
Common chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from 20 to more than 150 members, but spend most of their time travelling in small, temporary groups consisting of a few individuals, "which may consist of any combination of age and sex classes."<ref name="behaviour monographs">Van Lawick-Goodall, Jane (1968). "The Behaviour of Free-Living Chimpanzees in the Gombe Stream Reserve". Animal Behaviour Monographs (Rutgers University) 1 (3): 167.</ref> Both males and females will sometimes travel alone.<ref name="behaviour monographs"/> The common chimpanzee lives in a [[fission-fusion society]] and may be found in groups of the following types: all-male, adult females and offspring, consisting of both sexes, or one female and her offspring.  Chimpanzees have complex social relationships and spend a large amount of time grooming each other.<ref name="wild kingdom">The Chimpanzees of Tanzania". [[Wild Kingdom]]. December 31, 1976.</ref>

At the core of social structures are males, which roam around, protect group members, and search for food. Males remain in their natal communities, while females generally emigrate at adolescence. As such, males in a community are more likely to be related to one another than females are to each other.  Among males, there is generally a dominance hierarchy and males are dominant over females.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goldberg TL, Wrangham RW | year = 1997 | title = Genetic correlates of social behavior in wild chimpanzees: evidence from mitochondrial DNA| journal = Anim Beh | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 559–70 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.1996.0450 }}</ref> However, this unusual fission-fusion social structure, "in which portions of the parent group may on a regular basis separate from and then rejoin the rest,"<ref name=Goodall1986>{{cite book | last = Goodall | first = Jane | authorlink = Jane Goodall | year = 1986 | title = The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior | isbn = 0-674-11649-6}}</ref> is highly variable in terms of which particular individual chimpanzees congregate at a given time. This is mainly due to chimpanzees having a high level of individual autonomy within their fission-fusion social groups. Also, communities have large ranges that overlap with those of other groups.

As a result, individual chimpanzees often forage for food alone, or in smaller groups (as opposed to the much larger "parent" group, which encompasses all the chimpanzees which regularly come into contact and congregate into parties in a particular area). As stated, these smaller groups also emerge in a variety of types, for a variety of purposes. For example, an all-male troop may be organized to [[hunting|hunt]] for meat, while a group consisting of lactating females serves to act as a "nursery group" for the young.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pepper JW, Mitani JC, Watts DP | year = 1999 | title = General gregariousness and specific social preferences among wild chimpanzees | journal = Int J Prim | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 613–32 | doi = 10.1023/A:1020760616641 }}</ref>  An individual may encounter certain individuals quite frequently, but have run-ins with others almost never or only in large-scale gatherings. Due to the varying frequency at which chimpanzees associate, the structure of their societies is highly complicated.

[[Image:Adult male chimps in mahale.jpg|thumb|Male chimpanzees in Mahale National Park, Tanzania.]]
Male chimpanzees exist in a linear dominance hierarchy. Top-ranking males tend to be aggressive even during dominance stability.<ref name=Muller2002>Muller, MN. (2002) "Agonistic relations among Kanyawara chimpanzees", pp. 112–124 in: Boesch C, Hohmann G, Marchant LF, editors. ''Behavioural diversity in chimpanzees and bonobos''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521006139.</ref> This is likely due to the chimp’s fission-fusion society, with male chimps leaving groups and returning after extended periods of time. With this, a dominant male is unsure if there has been any "political maneuvering" and must re-establish his dominance. Thus, a large amount of aggression occurs 5–15 minutes after a reunion.<ref name=Muller2002/><ref name=Bygott1979>Bygott, JD.

Menlo Park: Benjamin-Cummings, ISBN 0805336699.</ref> During aggressive encounters, displays are preferred over attacks.<ref name=Muller2002/><ref name=Bygott1979/>

Males maintain and improve their social ranks by forming coalitions. These coalitions have been characterized as "exploitive" and are based on an individual’s  influence in agonistic interactions.<ref name=deWaal1987>de Waal, FBM. (1987) "Dynamic of social relationships", pp. 421–429 in: Smuts BB, Cheney DL, Seyfarth  RM, Wrangham RW, Struhsaker TT (eds.) ''Primate societies'', Chicago: University of  Chicago Press, ISBN 0226767167.</ref> Being in a coalition allows males to dominate a third individual when they could not by themselves, as politically apt chimps can exert power over aggressive interactions regardless of their rank. Coalitions can also give an individual male the confidence to challenge a dominant male. The more allies a male has, the better his chance of becoming dominant. However, most changes in hierarchical rank are caused by  [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] interactions.<ref name=Muller2002/> Chimpanzee alliances can be very fickle and one member may turn on another if it serves him.<ref name=Nishida1986>Nishida, T., M.

''Primate Societies''. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0226767167.</ref>

Low ranking males commonly switch sides in disputes between more dominant individuals. Low ranking males benefit from an unstable hierarchy and have increased sexual opportunities.<ref name=deWaal1987/><ref name=Nishida1986/> In addition, conflicts between dominant males causes them to focus on each other rather than the lower ranking males. Social hierarchies among adult females tend to be weaker. Nevertheless, the status of an adult female may be important for her offspring.<ref name=Pusey1997/> Females in Taï have also been recorded to form alliances.<ref>Stumpf, R.

===Mating and parenting===
[[File:Gombe Stream NP Mutter und Kind.jpg|thumb|Common chimpanzee infant and mother]]
Chimpanzees mate throughout the year, although the number of females in [[estrus]] varies seasonally in a group.<ref name=Boesch2000/><ref name=Wallis2002>Wallis J. (2002) "Seasonal aspects of reproduction and sexual behavior in two chimpanzee populations: a comparison of Gombe (Tanzania) and Budongo (Uganda)", pp. 181–91 in: Boesch C, Hohmann G, Marchant LF (eds.) ''Behavioural diversity in chimpanzees and bonobos''. Cambridge (England): Cambridge Univ Press, ISBN 0521006139.</ref> Female chimps are more likely to come into estrus when food is readily available. Estrous females exhibit sexual swellings. Chimp mating tends to be [[promiscuous]], with females mating with multiple males in her community during estrus.<ref name=Goodall1986/> As such, males have large testicles for [[sperm competition]]. However, other forms of mating also exist. A community's dominant males sometimes restrict reproductive access to females. A male and female can form consortship and mate outside their community. In addition, females sometimes leave their communities and mate with males from neighboring communities.<ref name=Goodall1986/><ref name=Gagneux1999>{{cite journal | author = Gagneux P, Boesch C, Woodruff DS | year = 1999 | title = Female reproductive strategies, paternity and community structure in wild West African chimpanzees | journal = Anim Beh | volume = 57 | pages = 19–32 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.1998.0972 }}</ref>

These alternative mating strategies give females more mating opportunities without losing the support of the males in their community.<ref name=Gagneux1999/> [[Infanticide (zoology)|Infanticide]] has been recorded in chimp communities in Gombe, Mahale, and [[Kibale National Park|Kibale]] National Parks. Male chimps practice infanticide on unrelated young to shorten the interbirth intervals in the females. There are also accounts of infanticide by females. There are questions whether cases of female infanticide are related to the dominance hierarchy in females or are simply isolated pathological behaviors.<ref name=Goodall1986/><ref name=Pusey1997>{{cite journal | author = Pusey AE, Williams J, Goodall J | year = 1997 | title = The influence of dominance rank on the reproductive success of female chimpanzees | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = 5327| pages = 828–831 | doi = 10.1126/science.277.5327.828 | pmid = 9242614 }}</ref>

Care for the young is provided mostly by their mothers. The survival and emotional health of the young is dependent on maternal care.<ref name=Goodall1986/> Mothers provide their young with food, warmth, and protection, and teach them certain skills. In addition, a chimp’s future rank may be dependent on its mother’s status.<ref name=Goodall1986/><ref name=Boesch2000/> For their first 30 days, infants cling to their mother's bellies. Newborn chimps are helpless; their grasping reflex is not strong enough to support them for more than a few seconds. Infants are unable to support their own weight for their first two months and need their mothers' support.<ref name=Bard1995>Bard KA. (1995) "Parenting in primates", pp. 27–58 in: Bornstein MH, editor. ''Handbook of parenting. Volume 2, Biology and ecology of parenting''. Mahwah (NJ): L Erlbaum Associates, ISBN 0805837795.</ref>

When they reach five to six months, infants ride on their mothers’ backs. They remain in continual contact for the rest of their first year. When they reach two years of age, they are able to move and sit independently.<ref name=Bard1995/> By three years, infants will move further away from their mothers. By four to six years, chimps are weaned and infancy ends.<ref name=Bard1995/>

The juvenile period for chimps lasts from their sixth to ninth years. Juveniles remain close to their mothers, but they also have more interactions with other members of their community. Adolescent females move between groups and are supported by their mothers in agonistic encounters. Adolescent males spend time with adult males in social activities like hunting and boundary patrolling.<ref name=Bard1995/>

===Communication===
Chimpanzees use a variety of facial expressions, postures and sounds to communicate with each other.<ref name=Goodall1986/> Chimps have expressive faces which are important in close-up communications. When frightened, a "full closed grin" causes nearby individuals to be fearful, as well. Other facial expressions include the "lip flip", "pout", "sneer", and "compressed-lips face".<ref name=Goodall1986/> When sumitting to a conspecific, a chimp will crunch, bob and extend a hand. When in an aggressive mode, a chimp will swagger bipedally, hunched over and arms waving, in an attempt to exaggerate its size.<ref name=Goodall1986/> Chimps will beat their hands and feet against the trunks of large tree, an act known as "drumming".<ref name=Crockford2005>{{cite journal | author = Crockford C, Boesch C | year = 2005 | title = Call combinations in wild chimpanzees | journal = Behaviour | volume = 142 | issue = 4| pages = 397–421 | doi = 10.1163/1568539054012047 }}</ref>

Vocalizations are also important in chimp communication. The most common and important call in adults is the "pant-hoot". These calls are made when individuals are excited.<ref name=Goodall1986/> Pant-hoots are made of four parts, starting with soft "hoos" that get louder and louder and climax into screams and sometimes barks; the former die down to soft "hoos" again as the call ends.<ref name=Crockford2005/> Submissive individuals will make "pant-grunts" towards their superiors.<ref name=Goodall1986/><ref name=Pusey1997/> Chimps use distance calls to draw attention to danger, food sources or other community members.<ref name=Goodall1986/> "Barks" may be made as "short barks" when hunting and "tonal barks" when sighting large snakes.<ref name=Crockford2005/>

===Tool use===
{{Further2|[[Tool use by animals]]}}
Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools. They will modify sticks, rocks, grass, and leaves and use them when foraging for honey, termites, ants, nuts, and water. Despite the lack of complexity, there does seem to be forethought and skill in making these tools and should be considered such.<ref name=Boesch1993>Boesch C, Boesch H. (1993) "Diversity of tool use and tool-making in wild chimpanzees", pp. 158–87 in: Berthelet A, Chavaillon J (eds.) ''The use of tools by human and non-human primates''. Oxford, England: Oxford Univ Press, ISBN 0198522630.</ref> While it has been known since Jane Goodall's 1960s discovery that modern chimpanzees use tools, research published in 2007 indicates that chimpanzee stone tool use dates to at least 4,300 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mercader J, Barton H, Gillespie J, ''et al.'' |title=4,300-year-old chimpanzee sites and the origins of percussive stone technology |journal=Proc.

Ant dipping is difficult and some chimps never master it. West African chimps will crack open hard nuts with stones or branches.<ref name=Boesch2000/><ref name=Boesch1993/> There seems to be some forethought in his activity as these items are not found together or near a source of nuts. Nut cracking is also difficult and must be learned.<ref name=Boesch2000/>  Chimps will also use leaves as sponges or spoons to drink water.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sugiyama Y | year = 1995 | title = Drinking tools of wild chimpanzees at Bossou | journal = Am J Prim | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 263–9 | doi = 10.1002/ajp.1350370308 }}</ref>

==Chimpanzees and humans==

===Field study===
[[Jane Goodall]] undertook the first long-term field study of the common chimpanzee, begun in [[Tanzania]] at [[Gombe Stream National Park]] in 1960. Other long-term study sites begun in 1960 include A. Kortlandt in eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Junichiro Itani]] in [[Mahale Mountains National Park]] in Tanzania.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen |first=Joel E. |title=Going Bananas |publisher=American Scholar |date=Winter 1993|pages=154–157}}</ref> Current understanding of the species' typical behaviors and social organization are formed largely from Goodall's ongoing 50-year Gombe research study.<ref name="Power.Anthropologist">{{cite journal |author=Power, Margaret |title=Divergence population genetics of chimpanzees |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=95 |year=1993 |month=December|pages=1010–11 |issue=4}}</ref>

===Genome Project===

[[Human]] and common chimpanzee [[DNA]] are very similar. After the completion of the [[Human Genome Project]], a [[Chimpanzee Genome Project]] was initiated. In December 2003, a preliminary analysis of 7600 genes shared between the two genomes confirmed that certain genes, such as the [[FOXP2|forkhead-box P2]] [[transcription factor]] which is involved in speech development, have undergone rapid evolution in the human lineage. A draft version of the chimpanzee genome was published on September 1, 2005, in an article produced by the [[Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium]].<ref>
{{cite journal |author=Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium  |title=Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=69–87 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16136131 |doi=10.1038/nature04072 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04072.html|bibcode = 2005Natur.437...69. }}<br /> {{cite journal |author=Cheng Z, Ventura M, She X, ''et al.'' |title=A genome-wide comparison of recent chimpanzee and human segmental duplications |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=88–93 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16136132 |doi=10.1038/nature04000 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04000.html |bibcode=2005Natur.437...88C}}</ref>

The DNA sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees is about thirty-five million [[Point mutation|single-nucleotide]] changes, five million [[Mutation#By effect on structure|insertion/deletion]] events, and various [[chromosome|chromosomal]] [[Chromosomal translocation|rearrangements]]. Typical human and chimp [[protein]] [[homology (biology)|homologs]] differ in only an average of two [[amino acid]]s. About 30% of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimp protein. Duplications of small parts of [[chromosome]]s have been the major source of differences between human and chimp genetic material; about 2.7% of the corresponding modern genomes represent differences, produced by gene duplications or deletions, during the approximately four to six million years since humans and chimps diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor. Results from human and chimp genome analyses, currently being conducted by [[geneticist]]s including [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]], should help in understanding the genetic basis of some human diseases.

===Link with human immunodeficiency virus type 1===
[[Image:South Djoum Chimp.jpg|thumb|This Cameroonian chimpanzee was brought to a rescue centre after its mother was killed by poachers.]]
Two types of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2.

===Status and conservation===
Chimpanzee are a legally protected species in most of their range and can be found both in and outside national parks.<ref name="iucn"/> There is thought to between 172,700 to 299,700 individuals living in the wild.<ref name="iucn"/>

The biggest threats to the common chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching and disease.<ref name="iucn"/> Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by deforestation in both West and Central Africa.  Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations and may allow poachers more access to areas that have not been seriously impacted by humans.<ref name="iucn"/> While deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may be done outside national parks.<ref name="iucn"/>

Chimpanzee are a common target for poachers. In [[Côte d’Ivoire]], chimpanzees make up 1–3% of [[bushmeat]] sold in urban markets.<ref name="iucn"/> They are also taken in pet trades despite it being illegal in many countries where they live.<ref name="iucn"/> Chimpanzees are also hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas.<ref name="iucn"/> Capturing chimpanzees for scientific research is still allowed in some countries, such as Guinea.<ref name="iucn"/> People will kill any chimpanzee that threatens their crops.<ref name="iucn"/> Chimps may also be unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.

Infectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. Chimpanzees succumb to many diseases that afflict humans since the two species are so similar.<ref name="iucn"/> As human populations grow, so does the risk of disease transmission between humans and chimpanzees.<ref name="iucn"/>
