A '''consumer''' is a person or group of people, such as a [[household]], who are the final users of products or services. The consumer's use is final in the sense that the product is usually [[Depreciation (economics)|not improved]] by the use.{{citation needed (lead)|date=September 2013}}

==Economics and marketing==
The consumer is the one who pays to consume the goods and services produced. As such, consumers play a vital role in the economic system of a nation. In the absence of effective consumer demand, producers would lack one of the key motivations to produce: to sell to consumers.
 
Typically, when [[business]] people and economists talk of ''consumers'', they are talking about ''the person as consumer'', an aggregated [[commodity]] item with little [[individuality]] other than that expressed in the decision to buy or not to buy. However, there is a trend in [[marketing]] to individualize the concept. Instead of generating broad [[demographic profile]]s and [[Psychographic|psycho-graphic profiles]] of [[market segment]]s, marketers have started to engage in [[personalized marketing]], [[permission marketing]], and [[mass customization]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Robert G.|title=Revenue management: hard-core tactics for market domination|publisher=Broadway Books|year=1997|pages=66â€“71|ISBN=978-0-553-06734-7}}

==Law and politics==
The law primarily uses the notion of the consumer in relation to [[consumer protection]] laws, and the definition of consumer is often restricted to living persons (i.e. not corporations or businesses) and excludes commercial users.<ref>{{cite book |author=Krohn, Lauren |title=Consumer protection and the law: a dictionary |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-87436-749-2}}</ref>  A typical legal rationale for protecting the consumer is based on the notion of policing market failures and inefficiencies, such as inequalities of bargaining power between a consumer and a business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/journals/journal/35-01/overby.htm|title=An Institutional Analysis of Consumer Law|accessdate=2007-01-29|publisher=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070302211417/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/journals/journal/35-01/overby.htm |archivedate = March 2, 2007}}</ref>  As of all potential voters are also consumers, consumer protection takes on a clear political significance.

Concern over the interests of consumers has also spawned much activism, as well as incorporation of consumer education into school curricula.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} There are also various non-profit publications, such as ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' and ''[[Choice Magazine]]'', dedicated to assist in consumer education and decision making, and ''[[Which?]]'' in the UK.

In India, the Consumer Protection Act 1986 clearly differentiates a consumer as consuming a commodity or service either for his personal domestic use or to earn his livelihood. Only consumers are protected as per this act and any person, entity or organization purchasing a commodity for commercial reasons are exempted from any benefits of this act.<ref>{{cite web

| quote = The consumer protection act 1986 of India, is a little more generous with the word 'Consumer'. According to this law, consumer is not only a person who uses the product for domestic personal use, but also one who uses the product to earn his daily livelyhood.

Furthermore, Indian case law has quite a few references on how to distinguish a consumer from a customer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Public reaction==
While use of the term ''consumer'' is widespread among governmental, business and media organisations, many individuals and groups find the label objectionable because it assigns a limited and passive role to their activities.<ref>{{cite web | title = Words to Avoid (or Use with Care).
