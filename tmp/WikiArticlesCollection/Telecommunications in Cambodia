'''Telacommunications in Cambodia''' include telephone, radio, television, and Internet services, which are regulated by the [[Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Cambodia|Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications]]. Transport and posts were restored throughout most of the country in the early 1980s during the [[History of Cambodia (1979-present)|People's Republic of Kampuchea]] regime after being disrupted under the [[Khmer Rouge]].

In January 1987, the Soviet-aided [[Intersputnik]] space communications station began operation in [[Phnom Penh]] and established two-way telecommunication links between the Cambodian capital and the cities of [[Moscow]], [[Hanoi]], [[Vientiane]] and [[Paris]]. The completion of the earth satellite station restored the telephone and telex links among Phnom Penh, [[Hanoi]], and other countries for the first time since 1975. Although telecommunications services were initially limited to the government, these advances in communications helped break down the country's isolation, both internally and internationally.

Today, with the availability of mobile phones, communications are open to all, though the country's [[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Minister]] [[Hun Sen]] decreed that [[3G]] [[mobile phone]]s would not be allowed to support video calling.

==Telephones==
* Fixed: 530,000 lines, 95th in the world, 4 per 100 persons (2011)<ref name=CIA-Factbook-Cambodia-2013/>
* Mobile cellular: 13.8 million lines, 58th in the world, 92 per 100 persons (2011)<ref name=CIA-Factbook-Cambodia-2013/>
* Satellite earth stations: 1 [[Intersputnik]] ([[Indian Ocean]] region)<ref name=CIA-Factbook-Cambodia-2013/>
* International access code: 855<ref name=CIA-Factbook-Cambodia-2013/>

The government state communications corporation is [[Telecom Cambodia]], founded in 2006 as an expansion of the telecom operating department of the [[Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Cambodia|Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications]]. 

Fixed line service in [[Phnom Penh]] and other provincial cities is available. Mobile-phone systems are widely used in urban areas to bypass deficiencies in the fixed-line network. Mobile phone coverage is rapidly expanding in rural areas. Mobile-cellular usage, aided by increasing competition among service providers, is increasing.<ref name=CIA-Factbook-Cambodia-2013/>

International calling access is adequate, but expensive. Fixed line and mobile service is available to all countries from Phnom Penh and major provincial cities.<ref name=CIA-Factbook-Cambodia-2013/>

===Internet censorship and surveillance===
In its ''Freedom on the Net 2013'' report, [[Freedom House]] gives Cambodia a "Freedom on the Net Status" of "partly free". 

Compared to traditional media in Cambodia, new media, including online news, social networks and personal blogs, enjoy more freedom and independence from government censorship and restrictions. However, the government does proactively block blogs and websites, either on moral grounds, or for hosting content deemed critical of the government. The government restricts access to sexually explicit content, but does not systematically censor online political discourse. Since 2011 three blogs hosted overseas have been blocked for perceived antigovernment content. In 2012, government ministries threatened to shutter internet cafes too near schools—citing moral concerns—and instituted surveillance of cafe premises and cell phone subscribers as a security measure.<ref name=FOTN-Cambodia-2013>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2013/cambodia "Cambodia country report"], ''Freedom on the Net 2013'', Freedom House, 3 October 2013. Retrieved 24 October 2013.</ref>

Early in 2011, very likely at the urging of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, all Cambodian ISPs blocked the hosting service [[Blogspot]], apparently in reaction to a December 2010 post on KI-Media, a blog run by Cambodians from both inside and outside the country. The site, which is often critical of the administration, described the prime minister and other officials as "traitors" after opposition leader [[Sam Rainsy]] alleged they had sold land to [[Vietnam]] at a contested national border. All ISPs but one subsequently restored service to the sites following customer complaints. In February 2011, however, multiple ISPs reinstated blocks on individual Blogspot sites, including KI-Media, Khmerization—another critical citizen journalist blog—and a blog by the Khmer political cartoonist Sacrava.<ref name=FOTN-Cambodia-2013/> 

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority. During 2012 NGOs expressed concern about potential online restrictions. In February and November, the government published two circulars, which, if implemented fully, would require Internet cafes to install surveillance cameras and restrict operations within major urban centers. Activists also reported concern about a draft “cybercrimes” law, noting that it could be used to restrict online freedoms. The government maintained it would only regulate criminal activity.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-2012>[http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&dlid=204192 "Cambodia"], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 21 March 2013. Retrieved 24 October 2013.</ref>

The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press; however, these rights were not always respected in practice. The 1995 press law prohibits prepublication censorship or imprisonment for expressing opinions; however, the government uses the penal code to prosecute citizens on defamation, disinformation, and incitement charges. The penal code does not prescribe imprisonment for defamation, but does for incitement or spreading disinformation, which carry prison sentences of up to three years. Judges also can order fines, which may lead to jail time if not paid. The constitution requires that free speech not adversely affect public security.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-2012/> 

The constitution declares that the king is “inviolable,” and a Ministry of Interior directive conforming to the defamation law reiterates these limits and prohibits publishers and editors from disseminating stories that insult or defame government leaders and institutions. The continued criminalization of defamation and disinformation and a broad interpretation of criminal incitement constrains freedom of expression.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-2012/> 

The law provides for the privacy of residence and correspondence and prohibits illegal searches; however, NGOs report that police routinely conduct searches and seizures without warrants.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-2012/> 

Corruption remains pervasive and governmental human rights bodies are generally ineffective. A weak judiciary that sometimes fails to provide due process or fair trial procedures is a serious problem. The courts lack human and financial resources and, as a result, are not truly independent and are subject to corruption and political influence.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-2012/>
