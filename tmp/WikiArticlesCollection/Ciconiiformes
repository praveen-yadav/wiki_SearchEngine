Traditionally, the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Ciconiiformes''' has included a variety of large, long-legged wading birds with large bills: [[stork]]s, [[heron]]s, [[egret]]s, [[ibis]]es, [[spoonbill]]s, and several others. Ciconiiformes are known from the Late [[Eocene]]. At present the only family retained in the order is the storks, [[Ciconiidae]].

== Taxonomic issues with Ciconiiformes ==

Following the development of research techniques in [[molecular biology]] in the late 20th century, in particular methods for studying [[DNA-DNA hybridisation]], a great deal of new information has surfaced, much of it suggesting that many birds, although looking very different from one another, are in fact more closely related than was previously thought. Accordingly, the radical and influential [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]] greatly enlarged the Ciconiiformes, adding many more families, including most of those usually regarded as belonging to the Sphenisciformes ([[penguin]]s), Gaviiformes ([[diver (bird)|diver]]s), Podicipediformes ([[grebe]]s), [[Procellariiformes]] ([[tubenose|tubenosed seabirds]]), [[Charadriiformes]], ([[wader]]s, [[gull]]s, [[tern]]s and [[auk]]s), [[Pelecaniformes]] ([[pelican]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[gannet]]s and allies), and the [[Falconiformes]] ([[bird of prey|diurnal birds of prey]]). The [[flamingo]] family, Phoenicopteridae, is related, and is sometimes classed as part of the Ciconiiformes.

However, morphological evidence suggests that the traditional Ciconiiformes should be split between two lineages, rather than expanded, although some non-traditional Ciconiiformes may be included in these two lineages.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The exact [[taxonomic]] placement of [[New World Vulture]]s remains unclear.<ref name="SACC"/> Though both are similar in appearance and have similar [[Ecological niche|ecological roles]], the New World and [[Old World Vultures]] evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world and are not closely related. Just how different the two families are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures belong in Ciconiiformes.<ref name="SibleyMonroe">{{cite book | last = Sibley | first = Charles | title = Distribution and Taxonomy of Birds of the World | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-300-04969-2 }}</ref> More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order [[Falconiformes]] along with the Old World Vultures<ref>{{cite book | last = Sibley | first = Charles | title = Phylogeny and Classification of Birds | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-300-04085-7 }}</ref> or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbl.2006.0523}}</ref> The [[South American Classification Committee]] has removed the New World Vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in ''[[Incertae sedis]]'', but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.<ref name="SACC">Remsen, J.

Some official bodies have adopted the proposed Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy almost entirely, however a more common approach worldwide has been to retain the traditional groupings, and modify rather than replace them in the light of new evidence as it comes to hand. The family listing here follows this more conservative practice. Bird taxonomy has been in a state of flux for some years, and it is reasonable to expect that the large differences between different classification schemes will continue to gradually resolve themselves as more evidence becomes available.
