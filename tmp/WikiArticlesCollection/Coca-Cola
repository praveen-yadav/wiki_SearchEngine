'''Coca-Cola''' is a [[carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]] sold in stores, restaurants, and [[vending machine]]s throughout the world.<ref>In June 2012, Coca-Cola announced its intentions to begin distributing in [[Myanmar]]. {{cite news|title=Coca-Cola to spend $30 billion to grow globally|first=Leon|last=Stafford|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/business/coca-cola-to-spend-30-billion-to-grow-globally/nR6YS/|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=Sept. 9, 2012|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref> It is produced by [[The Coca-Cola Company]] of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and is often referred to simply as '''Coke''' (a registered trademark of The Coca-Cola Company in the United States since March 27, 1944). Originally intended as a [[patent medicine]] when it was invented in the late 19th century by [[John Pemberton]], Coca-Cola was bought out by businessman [[Asa Griggs Candler]], whose marketing tactics led Coke to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.

The company produces [[concentrate]], which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company, produce finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. The bottlers then sell, distribute and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores and vending machines. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for [[soda fountain]]s to major restaurants and [[food service]] distributors.

The Coca-Cola Company has, on occasion, introduced other cola drinks under the Coke brand name. The most common of these is [[Diet Coke]], with others including [[Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola]], Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, [[Coca-Cola Cherry]], [[Coca-Cola Zero]], [[Coca-Cola Vanilla]], and special versions with lemon, lime or coffee.

Based on Interbrand's best global brand 2011, Coca-Cola was the world's most valuable brand.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/tech-news/apple-cracks-interbrands-best-global-brands-top-10-list/article2190531/?utm_medium=Feeds%3A%20RSS%2FAtom&utm_source=Home&utm_content=2190531 |title=Apple cracks Interbrand’s best global brands top 10 list |date=October 4, 2011 | location=Toronto |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |first=Simon |last=Houpt}}</ref>

By 1888, three versions of Coca-Cola – sold by three separate businesses – were on the market. A copartnership had been formed on January 14, 1888 between Pemberton and four Atlanta businessmen: J.C. Mayfield, A.O. Murphey; C.O. Mullahy and E.H. Bloodworth. Not codified by any signed document, a verbal statement given by Asa Candler years later asserted under testimony that he had acquired a stake in Pemberton's company as early as 1887.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 42 }}</ref> John Pemberton declared that the ''name'' "Coca-Cola" belonged to his son, Charley, but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the ''formula''.<ref name="Pendergrast1">{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = 2000-03-16| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 45&nbsp;–47 }}</ref>

Charley Pemberton's record of control over the "Coca-Cola" name was the underlying factor that allowed for him to participate as a major shareholder in the March 1888 Coca-Cola Company incorporation filing made in his father's place.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 45 }}</ref> More so for Candler especially, Charley's position holding exclusive control over the "Coca Cola" name continued to be a thorn in his side.

Asa Candler's oldest son, Charles Howard Candler, authored a book in 1950 published by [[Emory University]]. In this definitive biography about his father, Candler specifically states: "..., on April 14, 1888, the young druggist [Asa Griggs Candler] purchased a one-third interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as Coca-Cola."<ref>{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University. p. 81 | location = Georgia }}</ref>

The deal was actually between John Pemberton's son Charley and Walker, Candler & Co. - with John Pemberton acting as cosigner for his son. For $50 down and $500 in 30 days, Walker, Candler & Co. obtained all of the one-third interest in the Coca-Cola Company that Charley held, all while Charley still held on to the name.  After the April 14th deal, on April 17, 1888, one-half of the Walker/Dozier interest shares were acquired by Candler for an additional $750.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 44&nbsp;–45  }}</ref>

==== The Coca-Cola Company ====
In 1892, Candler set out to incorporate a second company; "The Coca-Cola Company" (the current corporation). When Candler had the earliest records of the "Coca-Cola Company" burned in 1910, the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 49  }}</ref>

After Candler had gained a better foothold of Coca-Cola in April 1888, he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names "Yum Yum" and "Koke".  This was while Charley Pemberton was selling the elixir, although a cruder mixture, under the name "Coca-Cola", all with his father's blessing.  After both names failed to catch on for Candler, by the summer of 1888, the Atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to Coca-Cola, and hoped he could force his two competitors, Walker and Dozier, completely out of the business, as well.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 44&nbsp;–45}}</ref>

When Dr. John Stith Pemberton suddenly died on August 16, 1888, Asa G. Candler now sought to move swiftly forward to attain his vision of taking full control of the whole Coca-Cola operation.

Charley Pemberton, an alcoholic, was the one obstacle who unnerved Asa Candler more than anyone else.  Candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name "Coca-Cola" from Pemberton's son Charley right after Dr. Pemberton's death. One of several stories was that Candler bought the title to the name from Charley's mother for $300; approaching her at Dr. Pemberton's funeral. Eventually, Charley Pemberton was found on June 23, 1894, unconscious, with a stick of opium by his side. Ten days later, Charley died at Atlanta's Grady Hospital at the age of 40.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 48&nbsp;–49}}</ref>

In Charles Howard Candler's 1950 book about his father, he stated: "On August 30th {1888}, he {Asa Candler} became sole proprietor of Coca-Cola, a fact which was stated on letterheads, invoice blanks and advertising copy."<ref>{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University. p. 81 | location = Georgia}}</ref>

With this action on August 30, 1888, Candler's sole control became technically all true.  Candler had negotiated with Margaret Dozier and her brother Woolfolk Walker a full payment amounting to $1,000, which all agreed Candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span.  By May 1, 1889, Candler was now claiming full ownership of the Coca-Cola beverage, with a total investment outlay by Candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to $2,300.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 46 }}</ref>

In 1914, Margaret Dozier, as co-owner of the original Coca-Cola Company in 1888, came forward to claim that her signature on the 1888 Coca-Cola Company bill of sale had been forged.  Subsequent analysis of certain similar transfer documents had also indicated John Pemberton's signature was most likely a forgery, as well, which some accounts claim was precipitated by his son Charley.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 45&nbsp;–47}}</ref>

=== Origins of bottling ===
The first bottling of Coca-Cola occurred in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], Mississippi, at the Biedenharn Candy Company in 1891.  The proprietor of the bottling works was Joseph A. Biedenharn. The original bottles were Biedenharn bottles, very different from the much later hobble-skirt design of 1915 now so familiar.

It was then a few years later that two entrepreneurs from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], namely; Benjamin F. Thomas and Joseph B. Whitehead, proposed the idea of bottling and were so persuasive that Candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar.  Candler never collected his dollar, but in 1899, Chattanooga became the site of the first Coca-Cola bottling company.  Candler remained very content just selling his company's syrup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chattanoogacocacola.com/history.asp |title= Chattanooga Coca-Cola History |accessdate=2008-08-24 }}</ref> The loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for The Coca-Cola Company for decades to come. Legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies, effectively becoming parent bottlers.<ref name=history-of-bottling>{{cite web |url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/history-of-bottling |title= History Of Bottling |accessdate=2013-01-07 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msXCIx46 | archivedate = January 18, 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref>

The first outdoor wall advertisement that promoted the Coca-Cola drink was painted in 1894 in [[Cartersville, Georgia]].<ref>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM2DK6 First painted wall sign to advertise Coca-Cola : Cartersville, GA] – Waymarking</ref>

Cola syrup is sold as an over-the-counter [[dietary supplement]] for upset stomach.<ref>Staff, The Doctors Book of Home Remedies.

===20th century landmarks===
By the time of its 50th anniversary, the soft drink had reached the status of a national icon in the USA. In 1935, it was certified [[kosher]] by Atlanta Rabbi [[Tobias Geffen]], after the company made minor changes in the sourcing of some ingredients.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=270 | title=Beyond Seltzer Water: The Kashering of Coca-Cola | publisher = American Jewish Historical Society |accessdate=2007-02-26}}</ref>

===New Coke===
{{Main|New Coke}}

On April 23, 1985, Coca-Cola, amid much publicity, attempted to change the [[Coca-Cola formula|formula]] of the drink with "New Coke". Follow-up taste tests revealed most consumers preferred the taste of New Coke to both Coke and [[Pepsi]], but Coca-Cola management was unprepared for the public's [[nostalgia]] for the old drink, leading to a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. The company gave in to protests and returned to a variation of the old formula using high fructose corn syrup instead of cane sugar as the main sweetener, under the name Coca-Cola Classic, on July 10, 1985.

===21st century===
On July 5, 2005, it was revealed that Coca-Cola would resume operations in Iraq for the first time since the [[Arab League]] boycotted the company in 1968.<ref>{{cite news|author=Rory Carroll in Baghdad |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jul/05/iraq.rorycarroll |title=Cola wars as Coke moves on Baghdad |work=The Guardian   |date= July 5, 2005|accessdate=2011-03-13 |location=London}}</ref>

In April 2007, in Canada, the name "Coca-Cola Classic" was changed back to "Coca-Cola". The word "Classic" was removed because "New Coke" was no longer in production, eliminating the need to differentiate between the two.<ref>According to a Coca-Cola customer-service representative.</ref> The formula remained unchanged.

In January 2009, Coca-Cola stopped printing the word "Classic" on the labels of {{convert|16|USfloz|ml|adj=on}} bottles sold in parts of the southeastern United States.<ref name="wsj">{{cite news |title=Coke to Omit 'Classic' |first=Betsy |last=McKay |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 30, 2009 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123332768434033495.html }}</ref> The change is part of a larger strategy to rejuvenate the product's image.<ref name=wsj/> The word "Classic" was removed from all Coca-Cola products by 2011.

In November 2009, due to a dispute over wholesale prices of Coca-Cola products, [[Costco]] stopped restocking its shelves with Coke and Diet Coke. However, some Costco locations (such as the ones in [[Tucson, Arizona]]), sell imported Coca-Cola from Mexico.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fredrix, Emily and Sarah Skidmore |title=Costco nixes Coke products over pricing dispute |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hC_n50ZLyl8FLDBIkGfCn7-110BwD9C1F1C80 |agency=Associated Press |date=November 17, 2009 }}</ref>

Coca-Cola introduced the 7.5-ounce mini-can in 2009, and on September 22, 2011, the company announced price reductions, asking retailers to sell eight-packs for $2.99. That same day, Coca-Cola announced the 12.5-ounce bottle, to sell for 89 cents.

===Formula of natural flavorings===
{{Main|Coca-Cola formula}}

The exact formula of Coca-Cola's natural flavorings (but not its other ingredients, which are listed on the side of the bottle or can) is a [[trade secret]]. The original copy of the formula was held in [[SunTrust Bank]]'s main vault in Atlanta for 86 years. Its predecessor, the Trust Company, was the [[underwriter]] for the Coca-Cola Company's [[initial public offering]] in 1919. On December 8, 2011, the original secret formula was moved from the vault at SunTrust Banks to a new vault containing the formula which will be on display for visitors to its [[World of Coca-Cola]] museum in downtown Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=csmonitor website | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2011/1208/Coca-Cola-formula-after-86-years-in-vault-gets-new-home | title=Coca-Cola formula, after 86 years in vault, gets new home | date=December 8, 2011}}</ref>

===Use of stimulants in formula===
[[File:Pembertoncokeanzeige.jpg|thumb|350px|An early Coca Cola advertisement.]]

When launched, Coca-Cola's two key ingredients were [[cocaine]] and [[caffeine]]. The cocaine was derived from the [[coca]] leaf and the caffeine from [[kola nut]], leading to the name Coca-Cola (the "K" in Kola was replaced with a "C" for marketing purposes).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/0204.htm |title=Coca-cola |publisher=Pponline.co.uk |accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/coca_cola.htm |title=The History of Coca Cola  | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QDrW0eoP | archivedate = July 10, 2007| deadurl=no}}</ref>

====Coca – cocaine====
Pemberton called for five [[ounce]]s of coca leaf per gallon of syrup, a significant dose; in 1891, Candler claimed his formula (altered extensively from Pemberton's original) contained only a tenth of this amount. Coca-Cola once contained an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass. In 1903, it was removed.<ref>Liebowitz, Michael, R. (1983). ''The Chemistry of Love''. Boston: Little, Brown, & Co.</ref>

After 1904, instead of using fresh leaves, Coca-Cola started using "spent" leaves – the leftovers of the cocaine-extraction process with trace levels of cocaine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_033.html|title=Is it true Coca Cola once contained cocaine? |accessdate=2007-02-27| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msXBwkls | archivedate = January 18, 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref> Coca-Cola now uses a cocaine-free coca leaf extract prepared at a [[Stepan Company]] plant in [[Maywood, New Jersey]].<ref>May, Clifford D.

====Kola nuts – caffeine====
Kola nuts act as a flavoring and the source of caffeine in Coca-Cola. In Britain, for example, the ingredient label states "Flavourings (Including Caffeine)."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/yourhealth/what_our_labels_tell_you/ |title=Coca-Cola Your Health – You and Your Family's GDA Questions Answered |publisher=Coca-cola.co.uk |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref> Kola nuts contain about 2.0 to 3.5% caffeine, are of bitter flavor and are commonly used in [[cola]] [[soft drinks]]. In 1911, the U.S. government initiated ''[[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]]'', hoping to force Coca-Cola to remove caffeine from its formula. The case was decided in favor of Coca-Cola. Subsequently, in 1912, the U.S. Pure Food and Drug Act was amended, adding caffeine to the list of "habit-forming" and "deleterious" substances which must be listed on a product's label.

Coca-Cola contains 34&nbsp;mg of caffeine per 12 fluid ounces (9.8&nbsp;mg per 100&nbsp;ml).<ref>{{cite book| author = Gene A. Spiller| title = Caffeine Content of Some Cola Beverages| url = http://books.google.com/?id=WxmBmvhsoZ8C&pg=PA363&lpg=PA363&dq=caffeine+coca+cola| year = 1998| publisher = CRC| isbn = 978-0-8493-2647-9 }}</ref>

===Franchised production model===
The actual production and distribution of Coca-Cola follows a franchising model. The Coca-Cola Company only produces a syrup concentrate, which it sells to bottlers throughout the world, who hold Coca-Cola franchises for one or more geographical areas. The bottlers produce the final drink by mixing the syrup with filtered water and sweeteners, and then carbonate it before putting it in cans and bottles, which the bottlers then sell and distribute to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants and food service distributors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/aboutbottling.html |title=Offices & Bottling Plants |accessdate=2013-01-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070216144908/http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/aboutbottling.html |archivedate = February 16, 2007 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

The Coca-Cola Company owns minority shares in some of its largest franchises, such as [[Coca-Cola Enterprises]], [[Coca-Cola Amatil]], [[Coca-Cola Hellenic|Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company]] and [[Coca-Cola FEMSA]], but fully independent bottlers produce almost half of the volume sold in the world.
Independent bottlers are allowed to sweeten the drink according to local tastes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cokecce.com/pages/allContent.asp?page_id=84#q1 |title=What Is the Difference Between Coca-Cola Enterprises and the Coca-Cola Company |accessdate=2007-02-22 }}

The bottling plant in [[Skopje]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], received the 2009 award for "Best Bottling Company".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/7151/1/ |title=Coca Cola: Macedonia makes the best Coke |publisher=Macedoniaonline.eu |date=June 16, 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref>

Coca-Cola has been a point of legal discussion in the Middle East. In the early 20th century, a [[fatwa]] was created in Egypt to discuss the question of "whether Muslims were permitted to drink Coca-Cola and Pepsi cola."<ref name="Liebesny 1975 42–43">{{cite book|last=Liebesny|first=Herbert J.|title=The law of the Near and Middle East readings, cases, and materials|year=1975|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|pages=42–43}}</ref> The fatwa states: "According to the Muslim Hanefite, Shafi'ite, etc., the rule in Islamic law of forbidding or allowing foods and beverages is based on the presumption that such things are permitted unless it can be show that they are forbidden on the basis of the Qur'an."<ref name="Liebesny 1975 42–43"/> The Muslim jurists stated that, unless the Qu'ran specifically prohibits the consumption of a particular product, it is permissible to consume. Another clause was discussed, whereby the same rules apply if a person is unaware of the condition or ingredients of the item in question.

===Logo design===

The Coca-Cola logo was created by John Pemberton's bookkeeper, [[Frank Mason Robinson]], in 1885.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/advertisingmedia/ss/Coca_Cola_Comp_2.htm |title=Coca Cola Company&nbsp;— Red Spencerian Script  | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msXCGA2o | archivedate = January 18, 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref> Robinson came up with the name and chose the logo's distinctive cursive script. The [[typeface]] used, known as [[Spencerian Script|Spencerian script]], was developed in the mid-19th century and was the dominant form of formal handwriting in the United States during that period.

Robinson also played a significant role in early Coca-Cola advertising. His promotional suggestions to Pemberton included giving away thousands of free drink coupons and plastering the city of [[Atlanta]] with publicity banners and [[streetcar]] signs.<ref>{{cite web|title = Frank Robinson, creator of the Coca-Cola logo| url=http://coca-cola-art.com/2008/06/05/frank-robinson/| accessdate = 2008-12-15}}</ref>

===Contour bottle design===
[[File:Coca cola Bottle.png|right|thumb|75px|The classic Coca-Cola contour bottle design]]
[[File:ContourBottleConceptSketch.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Earl R. Dean]]'s original 1915 concept drawing of the contour Coca-Cola bottle]]
[[File:1915 contour Coca-Cola contour bottle prototype.png|thumb|upright|The prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on [[conveyor belt]]s.]]

The  Coca-Cola bottle, called the "contour bottle" within the company, was created by bottle designer [[Earl R. Dean]]. In 1915, the [[Coca-Cola Company]] launched a competition among its bottle suppliers to create a new bottle for their beverage that would distinguish it from other beverage bottles, "a bottle which a person could recognize even if they felt it in the dark, and so shaped that, even if broken, a person could tell at a glance what it was."<ref name="vigo.lib.in.us">{{cite web |title=Inventory: Earl R. Dean Collection |url=http://www.vigo.lib.in.us/archives/inventories/business/dean.php|publisher=[[Vigo County Public Library]]|accessdate=2008-12-14}}</ref>

Chapman J. Root, president of [[the Root Glass Company]] of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and [[Earl R. Dean]], bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design on one of the soda's two ingredients, the [[coca leaf]] or the [[kola nut]], but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the [[Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library]] and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped [[cocoa pod]] in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.<ref name="vigo.lib.in.us"/>

Faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the mold-making machinery, over the next 24 hours Dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by Root the next morning. Dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glass-molding machinery was turned off.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bottle |last=Lundy |first=Betty |year=1986 |publisher=American Heritage Inc. |issn=0002-8738 |pages=98–101 |url=http://contourbottle.angelfire.com/The_Bottle.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

Chapman Root approved the prototype bottle and a [[design patent]] was issued on the bottle in November, 1915. The prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on [[conveyor belt]]s. Dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottle's middle diameter. During the 1916 bottler's convention, Dean's contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year. By 1920, the contour bottle became the standard for the [[Coca-Cola Company]]. Today, the contour Coca-Cola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on the planet..."even in the dark!".<ref name=history-of-bottling/>

As a reward for his efforts, Dean was offered a choice between a $500 bonus or a lifetime job at [[the Root Glass Company]]. He chose the lifetime job and kept it until the [[Owens-Illinois Glass Company]] bought out [[the Root Glass Company]] in the mid-1930s. Dean went on to work in other Midwestern glass factories.

One alternative depiction has [[Raymond Loewy]] as the inventor of the unique design, but, while Loewy did serve as a designer of Coke cans and bottles in later years, he was in the [[French Army]] the year the bottle was invented and did not emigrate to the United States until 1919. Others have attributed inspiration for the design not to the cocoa pod, but to a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] [[Hoop skirt|hooped dress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/bottle.asp |title=Snopes urban legend of the Coca-Cola bottle shape |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref>

In 1944, Associate Justice [[Roger J. Traynor]] of the [[Supreme Court of California]] took advantage of a case involving a waitress injured by an exploding Coca-Cola bottle to articulate the doctrine of [[strict liability]] for [[product liability|defective products]]. Traynor's [[concurring opinion]] in ''[[Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.]]'' is widely recognized as a landmark case in U.S. law today.<ref>See, e.g., Lawrence M. Friedman, ''American Law in the 20th century'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 356–357, and Jay M. Feinman, ''Law 101: Everything You Need to Know About the American Legal System'', rev. ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 165–168.</ref>

In 2007, the company's logo on cans and bottles changed. The cans and bottles retained the red color and familiar typeface, but the design was simplified, leaving only the logo and a plain white swirl (the "dynamic ribbon").

===Designer bottles===
[[Karl Lagerfeld]] is the latest designer to have created a collection of aluminum bottles for Coca-Cola. Lagerfeld is not the first fashion designer to create a special version of the famous Coca-Cola Contour bottle. A number of other limited edition bottles by fashion designers for Coca Cola Light soda have been created in the last few years.

In 2009, in Italy, Coca-Cola Light had a Tribute to Fashion to celebrate 100 years of the recognizable contour bottle. Well known Italian designers Alberta Ferretti, Blumarine, Etro, Fendi, Marni, Missoni, Moschino, and Versace each designed limited edition bottles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/2010/04/coca-cola-light-get-dressed-by-another.html|title=Coca-Cola Light Gets Dressed By Another Designer, Karl Lagerfeld|accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Competitors==
[[Pepsi]], the flagship product of [[PepsiCo]], The Coca-Cola Company's main rival in the soft drink industry, is usually second to Coke in sales, and outsells Coca-Cola in some markets. [[RC Cola]], now owned by the [[Dr Pepper Snapple Group]], the third largest soft drink manufacturer, is also widely available.

Coca-Cola's first such advertisement appeared in 1895, featuring the young Bostonian actress [[Hilda Clark]] as its spokeswoman.

1941 saw the first use of the nickname "Coke" as an official trademark for the product, with a series of advertisements informing consumers that "Coke means Coca-Cola".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-colaconversations.com/my_weblog/2008/06/coke-means-coca.html |title=Coke means Coca-Cola |publisher=Coca-Cola Conversations |date=June 16, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref> In 1971 a song from a Coca-Cola commercial called "[[I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing]]", produced by [[Roquel Billy Davis|Billy Davis]], became a [[hit single]].

Coke's advertising is pervasive, as one of [[Ernest Woodruff|Woodruff]]'s stated goals was to ensure that everyone on Earth drank Coca-Cola as their preferred beverage. This is especially true in southern areas of the United States, such as [[Atlanta]], where Coke was born.

Some Coca-Cola [[Television advertisement|television commercials]] between 1960 through 1986 were written and produced by former Atlanta radio veteran [[Don Naylor]] ([[WGST]] 1936–1950, [[WAGA (TV)|WAGA]] 1951–1959) during his career as a producer for the [[McCann Erickson]] [[advertising agency]]. Many of these early television commercials for Coca-Cola featured movie stars, sports heroes and popular singers.

During the 1980s, [[Pepsi-Cola]] ran a series of television advertisements showing people participating in taste tests demonstrating that, according to the commercials, "fifty percent of the participants who said they preferred Coke ''actually'' chose the Pepsi." Statisticians pointed out the problematic nature of a 50/50 result: most likely, the taste tests showed that in blind tests, most people cannot tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke. Coca-Cola ran ads to combat Pepsi's ads in an incident sometimes referred to as the ''[[cola wars]]''; one of Coke's ads compared the so-called [[Pepsi challenge]] to two [[chimpanzee]]s deciding which [[tennis ball]] was furrier. Thereafter, Coca-Cola regained its leadership in the market.

[[Selena]] was a spokesperson for Coca-Cola from 1989 till the time of her death. She filmed three commercials for the company. During 1994, to commemorate her five years with the company, Coca-Cola issued special Selena coke bottles.<ref>Orozco, Cynthia E.

The Coca-Cola Company purchased [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1982, and began inserting Coke-product images into many of its films. After a few early successes during Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia began to under-perform, and the studio was sold to [[Sony]] in 1989.

Coca-Cola has gone through a number of different [[advertising slogan]]s in its long history, including "The pause that refreshes," "I'd like to buy the world a Coke," and "Coke is it" (see [[Coca-Cola slogans]]).

In 2006, Coca-Cola introduced [[My Coke Rewards]], a customer loyalty campaign where consumers earn points by entering codes from specially marked packages of Coca-Cola products into a website. These points can be redeemed for various prizes or sweepstakes entries.<ref>[http://www.mycokerewards.com/ My Coke Rewards] (Official Site)</ref>

In Australia in 2011, Coca-Cola began the "share a Coke" campaign, where the Coca-Cola logo was replaced on the bottles and replaced with first names.

===Holiday campaigns===
[[File:Weihnachtstruck.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]] Coca-Cola Christmas truck in [[Dresden]], Germany.]]

Keith Law, a producer and writer of commercials for [[Belfast CityBeat]], was not convinced by Coca-Cola's reintroduction of the advertisement in 2007, saying that "I don't think there's anything Christmassy about [[Heavy Goods Vehicle|HGVs]] and the commercial is too generic."<ref>{{cite news|title=Do TV campaigns ad up?|author=Jane Hardy|date=December 27, 2007|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk./lifestyle/do-tv-campaigns-ad-up-13505247.html|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]}}</ref>

===Sports sponsorship===
Coca-Cola was the first commercial [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] of the Olympic games, at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 games]] in Amsterdam, and has been an Olympics sponsor ever since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/sponsors/coca-cola |title=Coca-Cola|publisher=Olympic Movement|accessdate = August 12, 2012 }}</ref> This corporate sponsorship included the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] hosted in [[Atlanta]], which allowed Coca-Cola to spotlight its hometown. Most recently, Coca-Cola has released localized commercials for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]]; one Canadian commercial referred to Canada's hockey heritage and was modified after Canada won the gold medal game on February 28, 2010 by changing the ending line of the commercial to say "Now they know whose game they're playing".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99msEwWpJBE |title=YouTube Post of Coca-Cola 2010 Olympic Hockey Commercial |accessdate=2010-03-02 }}</ref>

Since [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], Coca-Cola has sponsored the [[FIFA World Cup]], and other competitions organised by FIFA. One [[FIFA]] tournament trophy, the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|FIFA World Youth Championship]] from Tunisia in [[1977 FIFA World Youth Championship|1977]] to Malaysia in [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship|1997]], was called "FIFA&nbsp;— Coca Cola Cup".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/partners/index/0,3517,13,00.html |title=Marketing & TV > FIFA Partners > Coca Cola  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070112104745/http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/partners/index/0,3517,13,00.html |archivedate = January 12, 2007}}</ref> In addition, Coca-Cola sponsors the annual [[Coca-Cola 600]] and [[Coke Zero 400]] for the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]] and [[Daytona International Speedway]] in Daytona, Florida.

Coca-Cola has a long history of sports marketing relationships, which over the years have included [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]], as well as with many teams within those leagues. Coca-Cola has had a longtime relationship with the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], due in part to the now-famous [[Hey Kid, Catch!|1979 television commercial]] featuring [[Joe Greene (American football)|"Mean Joe" Greene]], leading to the two opening the Coca-Cola Great Hall at [[Heinz Field]] in 2001 and a more recent [[Coca-Cola Zero]] commercial featuring [[Troy Polamalu]].

Coca-Cola is the official soft drink of many [[College football|collegiate football]] teams throughout the nation, partly due to Coca-Cola providing those schools with upgraded athletic facilities in exchange for Coca-Cola's sponsorship. This is especially prevalent at the high school level, which is more dependent on such contracts due to tighter budgets.

Coca-Cola was one of the official sponsors of the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] held on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Coca Cola is also one of the associate sponsor of [[Delhi Daredevils]] in [[Indian Premier League]].

In England, Coca-Cola was the main sponsor of [[The Football League]] between 2004 and 2010, a name given to the three professional divisions below the [[Premier League]] in [[association football|football]] (soccer). It is also responsible for the renaming of these divisions&nbsp;— until the advent of Coca-Cola sponsorship, they were referred to as Divisions One, Two and Three. Since 2004, the divisions have been known as The Championship (equiv. of Division 1), League One (equiv. of Div. 2) and League 2 (equiv. of Division 3). This renaming has caused unrest amongst some fans, who see it as farcical that the third tier of [[Football in England|English Football]] is now called "League One." In 2005, Coca-Cola launched a competition for the 72 clubs of the football league&nbsp;— it was called "Win a Player". This allowed fans to place 1 vote per day for their beloved club, with 1 entry being chosen at random earning £250,000 for the club; this was repeated in 2006. The "Win A Player" competition was very controversial, as at the end of the 2 competitions, Leeds United AFC had the most votes by more than double, yet they did not win any money to spend on a new player for the club. In 2007, the competition changed to "Buy a Player". This competition allowed fans to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola Zero or Coca-Cola and submit the code on the wrapper on the Coca-Cola website {www.coca-colafootball.co.uk}. This code could then earn anything from 50p to £100,000 for a club of their choice. This competition was favored over the old "Win A Player" competition, as it allowed all clubs to win some money.

Introduced March 1, 2010, in Canada, to celebrate the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], Coca Cola sold gold colored cans in packs of 12 355 mL each, in select stores.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coca-Cola to Release Gold Can Commemorating the 2010 Olympics|url=http://bevwire.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/coca-cola-to-release-gold-can-commemorating-the-2010-olympics/|publisher=BevWire|accessdate=2010-03-22|date=March 1, 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, Coca-Cola (Philippines) hosted/sponsored the [[Coca-Cola PBA Youngstars]] in the Philippines.

Coca-Cola has been prominently featured in countless films and television programs. Since its creation, it remains as one of the most important elements of the [[popular culture]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} It was a major plot element in films such as ''[[One, Two, Three]]'', ''[[The Coca-Cola Kid]]'', and ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'' among many others. It provides a setting for comical corporate shenanigans in the novel ''[[Syrup (novel)|Syrup]]'' by [[Maxx Barry]]. And in music, in [[The Beatles]]' song, "[[Come Together]]", the lyrics said, "He shoot Coca-Cola, he say...".  [[The Beach Boys]] also referenced Coca-Cola in their [[1964 in music|1964]] song "All Summer Long" (i.e. 'Member when you spilled Coke all over your blouse?)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/All-Summer-Long-lyrics-Beach-Boys/A1E9E6CD61DA8C5F482569820027FD26 |title=All Summer Long Lyrics – Beach Boys |publisher=Sing365.com |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}</ref>

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of Coca-Cola}}

Coca-Cola has been criticized for alleged adverse health effects, its aggressive marketing to children, exploitative labor practices, high levels of pesticides in its products, building plants in [[Nazi Germany]] which employed slave labor, environmental destruction, monopolistic business practices, and hiring paramilitary units to murder trade union leaders. In October 2009, in an effort to improve their image, Coca-Cola partnered with the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], providing a $500,000 grant to help promote healthy-lifestyle education; the partnership spawned sharp criticism of both Coca-Cola and the AAFP by physicians and nutritionists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hcrenewal.blogspot.com/2009/11/paging-and-paying-dr-coca-cola.html |title=Health Care Renewal: Paging (and Paying) "Dr Coca-Cola" |publisher=Hcrenewal.blogspot.com |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref>

A common criticism of Coke based on its allegedly toxic acidity levels has been found to be baseless by researchers; [[lawsuit]]s based on these notions have been dismissed by several American courts for this reason. Although numerous court cases have been filed against The Coca-Cola Company since the 1920s, alleging that the acidity of the drink is dangerous, no evidence corroborating this claim has been found. Under normal conditions, [[scientific evidence]] indicates Coca-Cola's acidity causes no immediate harm.<ref>Mikkelson, Barbara & Mikkelson, David P. (2004).

Since 1980 in the U.S., Coke has been made with [[high-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) as an ingredient. Originally it was used in combination with more expensive cane-sugar, but by late 1984 the formulation was sweetened entirely with HFCS. Some nutritionists caution against consumption of HFCS because it may aggravate obesity and type-2 diabetes more than cane sugar.<ref>[http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/news/ng.asp?id=51623-single-food-ingredient "Single food ingredient the cause of obesity ?

In India, there is a controversy whether there are [[pesticide]]s and other harmful chemicals in bottled products, including Coca-Cola. In 2003 the [[Centre for Science and Environment|Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)]], a non-governmental organization in New Delhi, said [[aerated water]]s produced by soft drinks manufacturers in India, including multinational giants [[PepsiCo]] and Coca-Cola, contained toxins including [[lindane]], [[DDT]], [[malathion]] and [[chlorpyrifos]]&nbsp;— [[pesticides]] that can contribute to cancer and a breakdown of the [[immune system]]. CSE found that the Indian-produced Pepsi's soft drink products had 36 times the level of pesticide residues permitted under [[European Union]] regulations; Coca-Cola's soft drink was found to have 30 times the permitted amount. CSE said it had tested the same products sold in the U.S. and found no such residues.<ref>PTF (2003). [http://www.rediff.com/money/2003/aug/05pepsicoke.htm "Pepsi, Coke contain pesticides: CSE"].

After the pesticide allegations were made in 2003, Coca-Cola sales in India declined by 15 percent. In 2004 an Indian parliamentary committee backed up CSE's findings and a government-appointed committee was tasked with developing the world's first pesticide standards for soft drinks. The Coca-Cola Company has responded that its plants filter water to remove potential contaminants and that its products are tested for pesticides and must meet minimum health standards before they are distributed.<ref>Coca-Cola website (2006).
