Prehistoric commercial routes between Northern and Southern Europe were defined by the amber trade.   The '''Amber Road''' was an ancient [[trade route]] for the transfer of [[amber]] from coastal areas of the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref>[http://www.academia.edu/241848/Amber_in_the_Ancient_Near_East   Graciela Gestoso Singer, "Amber in the Ancient Near East", ''i-Medjat'' No. 2 (December 2008).  Papyrus Electronique des Ankou.]</ref> As an important raw material, sometimes dubbed "the gold of the north", amber was transported from the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] coasts overland by way of the [[Vistula]] and [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] rivers to [[Italy]], [[Greece]], the [[Black Sea]], [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] thousands of years ago, and long after.

From the [[Black Sea]], trade could continue to Asia along the [[Silk Road]], another ancient trade route.  In [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, a main route ran south from the Baltic coast through the land of the [[Boii]] (modern [[Czech Republic]]  and  [[Slovakia]]) to the head of the [[Adriatic Sea]] (modern [[Gulf of Venice]]).

The [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] towns of [[Mokhovoye|Kaup]] and [[Truso]] on the Baltic were the starting points of the route to the south. In [[Scandinavia]] the amber road probably gave rise to the thriving [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture, bringing influences from the Mediterranean Sea to the northernmost countries of Europe.

Sometimes the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] is called the Янтарный край, which means "the amber area".

===Central Europe===
The shortest (and possibly oldest) road avoids [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas and led from the Baltic coastline (nowadays [[Palanga Amber Museum|Lithuania]] and [[Poland]]), through [[Biskupin]] and rest of Poland, passed the [[Moravian Gate]], followed the river [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava]], crossed the [[Danube]] near [[Carnuntum]] in the [[Noricum Province]], headed southwest past [[Poetovio]], [[Celeia]], [[Emona]], [[Nauportus]], and reached [[Aquileia]] at the [[Adriatic]] coast. One of the oldest directions of the last stage of the Amber Road to the south of Danube, noted in the myth about the [[Argonauts]], used the [[Sava]] and [[Kupa (river)|Kupa]] rivers, ending with a short continental road from Nauportus to ''Tarsatica'' (Trsat, [[Rijeka]]) at the coast of the [[Adriatic]].

===Germany===
[[Image:German Amber Roads.gif|thumb|right|250px|Amber Roads in Germany]]
Several roads connected the North Sea and Baltic Seas, especially the city of [[Hamburg]] to the [[Brenner Pass]], proceeding southwards to [[Brindisi]] (nowadays Italy) and Ambracia (nowadays Greece).

===Switzerland===
The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] region indicates a number of alpine roads, concentrating around the capital city [[Bern]] and probably originating from the borders of the [[Rhône River]] and the [[Rhine]].

===The Netherlands===
A small section, including [[Baarn]], [[Barneveld]], [[Amersfoort]] and [[Amerongen]], connected the North Sea with the Lower Rhine.

===Belgium===
A small section led southwards from [[Antwerp]] and [[Bruges]] to the towns Braine-l’Alleud and Braine-le-Comte, both originally named "Brennia-Brenna".{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The route continued by following the [[Meuse River]] towards [[Bern]] in Switzerland.

===France===
Three routes may be identified leading from an amber finding region or delta at the mouth of River Openia towards Bresse and Bern, crossing the Alps to Switzerland and Italy.

===Southern France and Spain===
Routes connecting amber finding locations at Ambares (near [[Bordeaux]]), leading to [[Béarn]] and the Pyrenees. Routes connecting the amber finding locations in northern Spain and in the Pyrenees were a trading route to the Mediterranean Sea.
