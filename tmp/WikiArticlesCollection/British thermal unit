The '''British thermal unit''' ('''BTU''' or '''Btu''') is a traditional unit of [[energy]] equal to about 1055 [[joule]]s. It is the amount of energy needed to cool or heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. In science, the [[joule]], the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of energy, has largely replaced the BTU.

The BTU unit is most often used as a measure of power (as BTU/h) in the [[Electrical power industry|power]], [[steam]] generation, [[heating]], and [[air conditioning]] industries, and also as a measure of agricultural energy production (BTU/kg).{{Verify source|date=October 2011}} It is still used in [[Metric system|metric]] English-speaking countries (such as [[Canada]]), and remains the standard unit of classification for air conditioning units manufactured and sold in many non-English-speaking metric countries.{{Verify source|date=October 2011}} In [[North America]], the the heat value (energy content) of fuels is expressed in BTUs.

==Definitions==
A BTU is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of {{Convert|1|lb|kg|3}} of liquid water by {{convert|1|F-change}} at a constant pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/British-thermal-unit-Btu.html |title=What is British thermal unit (Btu)? definition and meaning |publisher=Businessdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}</ref> As with [[calorie]], several BTU definitions exist, which are based on different water temperatures and therefore vary by up to 0.5%.
A BTU can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden match<ref>Energy and the Environment. Ristinen, Robert A.  c.2006, pg 13</ref> or as the amount of energy it takes to lift a one-pound weight {{Convert|778|ft|m|0}}.<ref>Energy and the Environment. Ristinen, Robert A. c.2006, pg14</ref>

The unit '''MBtu''' or '''mBtu''' was defined as one thousand BTU, presumably from the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral system]] where "M" or "m" stands for one thousand (1,000). This is easily confused with the SI [[Mega-|mega (M)]] prefix, which multiplies by a factor of one million (1,000,000). To avoid confusion many companies and engineers use '''MMBtu''' or '''mmBtu''' to represent one million BTU. Alternatively a ''[[therm]]'' is used representing 100,000 or 10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;BTU, and a ''[[quad (energy)|quad]]'' as 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;BTU. Some companies also use BtuE6 in order to reduce confusion between a thousand BTU vs. a million BTU.<ref>{{cite web

==Conversions==
One BTU is approximately:
* 1.054 to 1.060 kJ (kilo[[joule]]s)
* 0.293071 W·h ([[watt hour]]s)
* 252 to 253&nbsp;cal ([[calorie]]s, or "little calories")
* 0.25 kcal (kilocalories, "large calories," or "food calories")
* 25,031 to 25,160&nbsp;ft·pdl ([[foot-poundal]])
* 778 to 782&nbsp;ft·lbf ([[foot-pound (energy)|foot-pounds-force]])
* 5.40395 (lbf/in<sup>2</sup>)·ft<sup>3</sup>

===For natural gas===
* In [[natural gas]], by convention 1&nbsp;MMBtu (1 million BTU) = 1.054615&nbsp;GJ.{{Verify source|date=July 2013}} 
* The energy content (high or low heating value) of a volume of natural gas varies with the composition of the natural gas, which means there is no universal conversion factor for the number of BTU to volume. 1 standard cubic foot of typical natural gas yields ≈ 1030&nbsp;BTU (between 1010&nbsp;BTU and 1070&nbsp;Btu, depending on quality, when burned)
* As a coarse approximation, 1000&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup> of natural gas yields ≈ 1&nbsp;MMBtu ≈ 1&nbsp;GJ

===As a unit of power===
When used as a unit of power for heating and cooling systems, BTU ''per hour'' (BTU/h) is the correct unit, though this is often abbreviated to just "BTU".{{Verify source|date=February 2011}}.

* 1 [[watt]] is approximately 3.41214&nbsp;BTU/h<ref>[http://knovel.com/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=2554&VerticalID=0 2009 ASHRAE Handbook – Fundamentals (I-P Edition)]. (pp: 38.2). [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]], Inc</ref>
* 1000&nbsp;BTU/h is approximately 293.071&nbsp;W
* 1 [[horsepower]] is approximately 2544&nbsp;BTU/h

==Associated units==
* 1 ''[[Ton of refrigeration|ton of cooling]]'', a common unit in North American refrigeration and air conditioning applications, is {{convert|12,000|BTU/h|kW|2|abbr=on}}. It is the amount of power needed to freeze {{convert|1|ST|LT t|3}} of water into ice in 24 hours.
* 1 ''[[therm]]'' is defined in the United States and European Union as 100,000&nbsp;BTU—but the U.S. uses the BTU<sub>59&nbsp;°F</sub> while the EU uses the BTU<sub>IT</sub>.
* 1 ''[[quad (energy)|quad]]'' (short for [[1,000,000,000,000,000|quadrillion]]BTU) is 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;BTU, which is about one exajoule ({{val|1.055|e=18|u=J}}). Quads are used in the United States for representing the annual energy consumption of large economies: for example, the U.S. economy used 99.75 quads in 2005.<ref>Husher, John Durbin. ''Crises of the 21st Century: Start Drilling-The Year 2020 Is Coming Fast'', iUniverse, 2009. Page 376.</ref> One quad/year is about 33.43 gigawatts.

The BTU should not be confused with the [[Board of Trade Unit]] (B.O.T.U.), which is a much larger quantity of energy ({{convert|1|kW·h|BTU|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

The BTU is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants. Figures are quoted in terms of the quantity of heat in BTU required to generate 1&nbsp;kW·h of electrical energy. A typical coal-fired power plant works at 10,500&nbsp;BTU/kW·h, an efficiency of 32–33%.<ref>[http://www.npc.org/Study_Topic_Papers/4-DTG-ElectricEfficiency.pdf Electric Generation Efficiency, NPC Global Oil & Gas Study, 18 July 2007]</ref>
