The '''beaver''' ([[genus]] '''''Castor''''') is a primarily [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]], large,  [[semi-aquatic]] [[rodent]]. ''Castor'' includes two [[extant taxon|extant]] species, [[North American beaver]] ''(Castor canadensis)'' (native to North America) and [[Eurasian beaver]] ''(Castor fiber)'' ([[Eurasia]]).<ref name = MSW3>{{MSW3 Castoridae | id = 12600003 | pages = 842–843 | heading = Genus ''Castor''}}</ref> Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the [[capybara]]). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6–12 million. This population decline is due to extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because their harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.<ref name="MotW5">Nowak, Ronald M. 1991. pp. 364–367. ''Walker's Mammals of the World'' Fifth Edition, vol. I. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.</ref>

==General==
Beavers are known for their natural trait of building dams on rivers and streams, and building their homes (known as "lodges") in the resulting pond. Beavers also build canals to float building materials that are difficult to haul over land.<ref name=Salvesen>{{cite journal |title=The Beaver in Norway |author=Sigvald Salvesen |year=1928-05 |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |pages=99–104 |accessdate=2011-09-22 |jstor=1373424}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animaltrial.com/beaver/beaverdamandcanals.html|title=Beaver Dams and Canals|publisher=animaltrail|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref> They use powerful front teeth to cut trees and other plants that they use both for building and for food. In the absence of existing ponds, beavers must construct dams before building their lodges. First they place vertical poles, then fill between the poles with a crisscross of horizontally placed branches. They fill in the gaps between the branches with a combination of weeds and mud until the dam impounds sufficient water to surround the lodge.

[[Image:Beaver skeleton.jpg|thumb|300px|A beaver [[skeleton]] on display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma.]]
They are known for their alarm signal: when startled or frightened, a swimming beaver will rapidly dive while forcefully slapping the water with its broad tail, audible over great distances above and below water. This serves as a warning to beavers in the area. Once a beaver has sounded the alarm, nearby beavers will dive and may not reemerge for some time. Beavers are slow on land, but are good swimmers, and can stay under water for as long as 15 minutes.

Beavers are herbivores, and prefer the wood of [[quaking aspen]], [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]], [[willow]], [[alder]], [[birch]], [[maple]] and [[cherry]] trees. They also eat [[sedges]], [[pondweed]], and [[water lilies]].<ref>http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/wdb/pub/wmh/13_4_7.pdf</ref>

Beavers do not hibernate, but store sticks and logs in a pile in their ponds, eating the underbark. Some of the pile is generally above water and accumulates snow in the winter. This insulation of snow often keeps the water from freezing in and around the food pile, providing a location where beavers can breathe when outside their lodge.

Fossil remains of beavers are found in the peat and other superficial deposits of Britain and the continent of Europe; while in the [[Pleistocene]] formations of Britain and Siberia, remains of a giant extinct beaver have been found, ''[[Trogontherium|Trogontherium cuvieri]]'', representing a genus by itself.

Beavers have webbed hind-feet, and a broad, scaly tail. They have poor eyesight, but keen senses of hearing, smell, and touch. A beaver's teeth grow continuously so that they will not be worn down by chewing on wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beaversolutions.com/about_beaver_biology.asp |title=Beaver Biology |publisher=Beaver Solutions |accessdate=2010-03-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100414110435/http://www.beaversolutions.com/about_beaver_biology.asp| archivedate= April 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Their four incisors are composed of hard orange enamel on the front and a softer [[dentin]] on the back. The chisel-like ends of incisors are maintained by their self-sharpening wear pattern.

Beavers continue to grow throughout their lives. Adult specimens weighing over {{convert|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} are not uncommon. Females are as large as or larger than males of the same age, which is uncommon among [[mammal]]s. Beavers live up to 24 years of age in the wild.

==Etymology==
The word ''beaver'' (plural ''beaver'' or ''beavers'')<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/beaver]</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/beaver]</ref> is descended from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] name of the animal, cf. Sanskrit ''babhru's,'' brown, [[Latin|Lat.]] ''fiber,'' [[German language|Ger.]] ''Biber,'' [[Russian language|Russ.]] ''bobr;'' the root ''bhru'' has given "brown", and, through [[Romance languages|Romanic]], "[[bronze]]" and "[[burnish]]".<ref name="EB11">''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 11th Ed.</ref>  It is probable that ''beaver'' in English is either borrowed from the Old French ''bièvre'' or both came directly from the Celtic ''*befros''. ''Castor'' supplanted ''bièvre'' in the course of the twelfth century in France.<ref>''Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue française'', Oscar Bloch and Walther von Wartburg, 5th edn., 1968.</ref>

==Species==
They are the only [[extant taxon|extant]] members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Castoridae]], which contains a single [[genus]], '''''Castor'''''. [[genetics|Genetic]] research has shown the European and North American beaver populations to be distinct species and that [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization is unlikely.

[[File:beaver tracks.jpg|thumb|400px|North American beaver tracks]]
Although superficially similar to each other, there are several important differences between the two species. Eurasian beavers tend to be slightly larger, with larger, less rounded heads, longer, narrower muzzles, thinner, shorter and lighter underfur, narrower, less oval-shaped tails and shorter shin bones, making them less capable of bipedal locomotion than the North American species. Eurasian beavers have longer nasal bones than their North American cousins, with the widest point being at the end of the snout for the former, and in the middle for the latter. The nasal opening for the Eurasian species is triangular, unlike that of the North American race which is square. The ''[[foramen magnum]]'' is rounded in the Eurasian beaver, and triangular in the North American. The [[anal gland]]s of the Eurasian beaver are larger and thin-walled with a large internal volume compared to that of the North American species.  The guard hairs of the Eurasian beaver have a longer hollow medulla at their tips. Fur colour is also different. Overall, 66% of Eurasian beavers have pale brown or beige fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown and only 4% have blackish coats. In North American beavers, 50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown and 6% are blackish.<ref name="andy">{{cite book |author=Kitchener, Andrew |url= |title=Beavers |year=2001 |isbn=1-873580-55-X |page=144 |publisher=Whittet |location=Stowmarket }}</ref>

The two species are not genetically compatible. North American beavers have 40 [[chromosomes]], while Eurasian beavers have 48. Also, more than 27 attempts were made in Russia to hybridize the two species, with one breeding between a male North American beaver and a female European resulting in one stillborn kit. These factors make interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species' ranges overlap.<ref name="andy" />

===Eurasian beaver===
{{Main|Eurasian beaver}}

[[File:Beaver pho34.jpg|thumb|A Eurasian beaver]]
The Eurasian beaver (''Castor fiber'') was nearly hunted to [[extinction]] in Europe, both for fur and for ''[[castoreum]]'', a secretion of its scent gland believed to have medicinal properties. However, the beaver is now being re-introduced throughout Europe. Several thousand live on the [[Elbe]], the [[Rhone River|Rhone]] and in parts of [[Scandinavia]]. A thriving community lives in northeast Poland, and the Eurasian beaver also returned to the [[Morava River]] banks in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. They have been [[reintroduction|reintroduced]] in Scotland ([[Knapdale]]),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/may/26/endangeredspecies.conservation |title=Beavers returning to UK after 400 years |work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Severin | last=Carrell | date=26 May 2008 | accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> [[Bavaria]], Austria, Netherlands, Serbia ([[Zasavica (bog)|Zasavica]] bog), Denmark (West [[Jutland]]) and Bulgaria and are spreading to new locations. The beaver became extinct in Great Britain in the sixteenth century: [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] reported in 1188 (''Itinerarium'' ii.iii) that it was to be found only in the [[Teifi]] in Wales and in one river in Scotland, though his observations are clearly second hand. In 2001 [[Kent Wildlife Trust]] successfully introduced a family of beavers at Ham Fen, the last remaining ancient fenland in the county close to the town of [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]; these are now established and are breeding. In October 2005, six Eurasian beavers were reintroduced to Britain in Lower Mill Estate in [[Gloucestershire]]; in July 2007 a colony of four Eurasian beavers was established at [[Martin Mere]] in Lancashire,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/6291260.stm |title=Beavers are back after 500 years |date=11 July 2007 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> and a trial re-introduction occurred in Scotland in May 2009. Feasibility studies for a reintroduction to Wales are at an advanced stage and a preliminary study for a reintroduction of beavers to the wild in England has recently been published.<ref>[http://www.msn.co.uk/htx/returnofthebeaver/ Return of the Beavers at MSN.co.uk]</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/7158210.stm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080206025535/http://www.msn.co.uk/htx/returnofthebeaver/| archivedate=6 February 2008 |publisher=BBC |title=Beavers could be released in 2009 |date=24 December 2007}}</ref>

===North American beaver===
{{Main|North American beaver}}
[[File:Castor canadensis.jpg|thumb|A North American beaver]]
The North American beaver ''(Castor canadensis)'', also called the Canadian beaver (which is also the name of a subspecies), American beaver, or simply beaver in North America, is native to Canada, much of the United States and parts of northern Mexico. The chief feature distinguishing ''C. canadensis'' from '' C. fiber'' is the form of the nasal bones of the skull.<ref name="EB11" />  This species was introduced to the Argentine and Chilean Tierra del Fuego, as well as Finland, France, Poland and Russia.

The North American beaver's preferred food is the water-lily (genus ''[[Nuphar]]''), which bears a resemblance to a cabbage-stalk, and grows at the bottom of lakes and rivers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beaversww.org/beaver.html |title=The Beaver (Castor canadensis) |year=2002 |accessdate=2008-05-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430104013/http://www.beaversww.org/beaver.html |archivedate = 30 April 2008}}</ref> Beavers also gnaw the bark of [[birch]], [[poplar]], and [[willow]] trees; but during the summer a more varied herbage, with the addition of berries, is consumed.
These animals are often trapped for their fur. During the early 19th century, trapping eliminated this animal from large portions of its original range. However, through trap and transfer and [[habitat conservation]] it made a nearly complete recovery by the 1940s. Beaver furs were used to make clothing and top-hats. Much of the early exploration of North America was driven by the quest for this animal's fur.<ref>[http://www.mountainsofstone.com/oregon_country.htm Manifest Destiny: The Oregon Country and Westward Expansion]</ref><ref>{{cite book

==Habitat==
[[File:BeaverSwimming.JPG|thumb|right|Beaver swimming]]
The habitat of the beaver is the [[riparian zone]], inclusive of stream bed. The actions of beavers for hundreds of thousands of years{{Nonspecific|date=June 2011}} in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] have kept these watery systems healthy and in good repair, although a human observing all the downed trees might think that the beavers were doing just the opposite.

The beaver works as a [[keystone species]] in an [[ecosystem]] by creating [[wetlands]] that are used by many other species. Next to humans, no other extant animal appears to do more to shape its landscape.<ref>Beaver. In ''Animals''. Retrieved June 15, 2009, from http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/beaver.html (beavers second only to humans in their ability to manipulate and change their environment)</ref>  Beavers potentially even impact [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wohl|first=Ellen|title=Landscape-scale carbon storage associated with Beaver Dams|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=2013|doi=10.1002/grl.50710|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/grl.50710/abstract|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> 

Beavers fell trees for several reasons. They fell large mature trees, usually in strategic locations, to form the basis of a dam, but European beavers tend to use small diameter (<10&nbsp;cm) trees for this purpose. Beavers fell small trees, especially young second-growth trees, for food. Broadleaved trees re-grow as a [[coppice]], providing easy-to-reach stems and leaves for food in subsequent years. Ponds created by beavers can also kill some tree species by drowning but this creates standing dead wood, which is very important for a wide range of animals and plants.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Dams===
{{Main|Beaver dam}}
[[File:Beaver signs.JPG|thumb|These trees, up to {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, were felled by beavers in one night.]]
Beaver dams are created as a protection against predators, such as coyotes, wolves and bears, and to provide easy access to food during winter. Beavers always work at night and are prolific builders, carrying mud and stones with their fore-paws and timber between their teeth. Because of this, destroying a beaver dam without removing the beavers is difficult, especially if the dam is downstream of an active lodge. Beavers can rebuild such primary dams overnight, though they may not defend secondary dams as vigorously. (Beavers may create a series of dams along a river.)

===Lodges===
{{redirect|Beaver lodge|the town in Alberta, Canada|Beaverlodge}}

The ponds created by well-maintained dams help isolate the beavers' homes, which are called ''lodges''.  These are created from severed branches and mud. The beavers cover their lodges late each autumn with fresh mud, which freezes when frosts arrive. The mud becomes almost as hard as stone, thereby preventing [[Gray Wolf|wolves]] and [[wolverine]]s from penetrating the lodge.

The lodge has underwater entrances which makes entry nearly impossible for any other animal, although [[muskrats]] have been seen living inside beaver lodges with the beavers who made them.<ref>''The Life of Mammals'' Episode 4, "Chisellers".</ref>  Only a small amount of the lodge is actually used as a living area. Contrary to popular belief, beavers actually dig out their dens with underwater entrances after they finish building the dams and lodge structures. There are typically two dens within the lodge, one for drying off after exiting the water and another, drier one, in which the family lives.

Beaver lodges are constructed with the same materials as the dams, with little order or regularity of structure.  They seldom house more than four adults and six or eight juveniles. Some larger lodges have one or more partitions, but these are only posts of the main building left by the builders to support the roof. Usually, the dens have no connection with each other except by water.

When the ice breaks up in spring, beavers usually leave their lodges and roam until just before autumn, when they return to their old lodges and gather their winter stock of wood. They seldom begin to repair the lodges until the frost sets in, and rarely finish the outer coating until the cold becomes severe. When they erect a new lodge, they fell the wood early in summer but seldom begin building until nearly the end of August.

The term "beaver fever" is a misnomer coined by the American press in the 1970s, following findings that the parasite ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', which causes [[Giardiasis]], is carried by beavers. However, further research has shown that many animals and birds carry this parasite, and the major source of water contamination is by other humans.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reintroducing the European Beaver in Britain |journal=British Wildlife |year=2008 |url=http://www.beaversinengland.com/downloads/ReintroducingtheEuropeanBeaverinBritain.pdf |accessdate=2011-03-05 |author=Martin Gaywood, Dave Batty, Colin Galbraith }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= Waterborne giardiasis: sources of Giardia cysts and evidence pertaining to their implication in human infection in P.

===As an introduced non-native species===
{{See also|Beaver eradication in Tierra del Fuego}}
[[File:beaver damage navarino chile.JPG|thumb|right|Beaver damage on the north shore of Robalo Lake, [[Navarino Island]], Chile]]

In the 1940s, beavers were brought from northern Manitoba in Canada to the island of [[Tierra Del Fuego]] in southern Chile and Argentina, for commercial fur production. However, the project failed and the beavers, ten pairs, were released into the wild. Having no natural predators in their new environment, they quickly spread throughout the island, and to other islands in the region, reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. They are now considered a serious [[invasive species]] in the region, due to their massive destruction of forest trees, and efforts are being made for their eradication.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/NATURE/9907/09/argentina.beaver/ | work=CNN | title=Argentina eager to rid island of beavers | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>  The drastically different ecosystem has led to substantial environmental damage, as the ponds created by the beavers have no ecological purpose (wetlands do not form there as they do in the beavers' native territory) and there are no native, large predators.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} They have also been found to cross salt water to islands northward; a possible encroachment on the mainland has naturalists highly concerned.

In contrast, areas with introduced beaver were associated with increased populations of native [[Common galaxias|puye]] fish (''Galaxias maculatus''), whereas the exotic [[brook trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis'') and [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') had negative impacts on native stream fishes in the [[Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve]], Chile.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1577/T08-081.1 |title=Implications of Beaver Castor canadensis and Trout Introductions on Native Fish in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile |author=Michelle C.

Beavers are classed as a "prohibited new organism" under New Zealand's [[Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996]], preventing it from being imported into the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0030/latest/DLM386556.html#DLM386556|title=Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 2003 – Schedule 2 Prohibited new organisms|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref>

==Social behavior==
===Family life===
[[File:Beaver 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A beaver pair]]
The basic units of beaver social organization are families consisting of an adult male and adult female in a monogamous pair and their kits and yearlings.<ref name= "Lixing 2003">{{cite book |title=The Beaver: Natural History of a Wetlands Engineer |authors=Dietland Müller-Schwarze, Lixing Sun |page=80 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eqIenKko3lAC&q=estrus#v=onepage&q=reproduction&f=false |accessdate=2011-06-25 |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8014-4098-4 }}</ref> Beaver families can have as many as ten members in addition to the monogamous pair. Groups this size or close to this size build more lodges to live in while smaller families usually need only one.<ref name= "Lixing 2003"/> However, large families in the northern hemisphere have been recorded living in one lodge. Beaver pairs mate for life; however, if a beaver's mate dies, it will partner with another one. Extra-pair copulations also occur.<ref name= "Lixing 2003"/> In addition to being monogamous, both the male and female take part in raising offspring. They also both mark and defend the territory and build and repair the dam and lodge.<ref name= "Lixing 2003"/> When young are born, they spend their first month in the lodge and their mother is the primary caretaker while their father maintains the territory. In the time after they leave the lodge for the first time, yearlings will help their parents build food caches in the fall and repair dams and lodges. Still, adults do the majority of the work and young beavers help their parents for reasons based on natural selection rather than kin selection. They are dependent on them for food and for learning life skills.<ref name= "Lixing 2003"/> Young beavers spend most of their time playing but also copy their parents' behavior. However while copying behavior helps imprint life skills in young beavers it is not necessarily immediately beneficial for parents as the young beaver do not perform the tasks as well as the parents.<ref name= "Lixing 2003"/>

Older offspring, which are around two years old, may also live in families and help their parents. In addition to helping build food caches and repairing the dam, two-year olds will also help in feeding, grooming and guarding younger offspring.<ref name= "Lixing 2003"/> Beavers also practice [[Alloparenting|alloparental care]], in which an older sibling may take over the parenting duties if the original parents die or are otherwise separated from them. This behavior is common and is seen in many other animal species such as the elephant and [[fathead minnow]].<ref>Riedman, Marianne L. (December 1982). “The Evolution of Alloparental Care in Mammals and Birds”. The Quarterly Review of Biology 57 (4): 405-435</ref> While these helping two-year olds help increase the chance of survival for younger offspring, they are not essential for the family and two-year olds only stay and help their families if there is a shortage of resources in times of food shortage, high population density, or drought.<ref name= "Lixing 2003"/> When beavers leave their natal territories, they usually do not settle far.<ref name= "Bjorkoyli 2002">{{cite journal | last1 = Bjorkoyli | first1 = Tore | last2 = Rosell | first2 = Frank | year = 2002 | title = A Test of the Dear Enemy Phenomenon in the Eurasian Beaver | url = | journal = Animal Behavior | volume = 63 | issue = 6| pages = 1073–78 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2002.3010 }}</ref> Beavers can recognize their kin by detecting differences in anal gland secretion composition using their keen sense of smell.<ref name= "Lixing 1998">Sun, Lixing, and Dietland Muller-Schwarze.

===Territories and spacing===
[[File:AmericanBeaver.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Beaver and its dam]]
Beavers maintain and defend territories, which are areas for feeding, nesting and mating.<ref name= "Lixing 2003"/> They invest much energy in their territories, building their dams and becoming familiar with the area.<ref name= "Rosell 1997">{{cite journal | last1 = Rosell | first1 = Frank | last2 = Nolet | first2 = Bart A. | year = 1997 | title = Factors Affecting Scent-Marking Behavior in Eurasian Beaver (Castor Fiber) | url = | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 673–89 | doi = 10.1023/B:JOEC.0000006403.74674.8a }}</ref> Beavers mark their territories by constructing scent mounts made of mud, debris and castoreum,<ref name= "Rosell 2000">Rosell, Frank, and Andrezej Czech.

Wildlife Biology 6(1): 13–21.</ref> a urine based substance excreted through the beavers [[castor sac]]s between the pelvis and base of the tail.<ref name= "Rosell 1997"/> These scent mounts are established on the border of the territory.<ref name= "Rosell 2000"/> Once a beaver detects another scent in its territory, finding the intruder takes priority, even over food.<ref name= "Rosell 2000"/>
Because they invest so much energy in their territories, beavers are intolerant of intruders and the holder of the territory is more likely to escalate an aggressive encounter.<ref name= "Rosell 1997"/> These encounters are often violent. To avoid such situations, a beaver marks its territory with as many scent mounds as possible, signaling to intruders that the territory holder has enough energy to maintain its territory and is thus able to put up a good defense. As such, territories with more scent mounts are avoided more often than ones with fewer mounts.<ref name= "Rosell 1997"/> Scent marking increases in August during the dispersal of yearlings, in an attempt to prevent them from intruding on territories.<ref name= "Rosell 1997"/>  Beavers also exhibit a behavior known as the "[[dear enemy effect]]". A territory-holding beaver will investigate and become familiar with the scents of its neighbors.<ref name= "Bjorkoyli 2002"/> As such they respond less aggressively to intrusions by their territorial neighbours than those made by non-territorial floaters or "strangers".<ref name= "Bjorkoyli 2002"/>

Occurrences of beaver aggression, however, have been reported. In April 2013, an [[Angling|angler]], near Minkovichi in the [[Brest, Belarus|Brest region]] of [[Belarus]], died after being bitten twice on the leg by a wild Eurasian beaver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belarus/9987265/Beaver-bites-man-to-death.html |title=Beaver 'bites man to death' |author=Tom Parfitt |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=11 April 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref>

==Commercial uses==
[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait by Napoleon Sarony - albumen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Oscar Wilde]] in beaver [[fur coat]]]]
Both beaver [[testicles]] and [[castoreum]], a bitter-tasting secretion with a slightly fetid odor contained in the castor sacs of male or female beaver, have been articles of trade for use in traditional medicine. [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] ([[Eskimo]]) medicine used dried beaver testicles like willow bark to relieve pain. Dried beaver testicles were also used as contraception.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=William Brenton |title=Medicine in New Brunswick : a history of the practice of medicine...from prior to the arrival of the white man in America to the early part of the twentieth century|year=1974|publisher=The New Brunswick Medical Society|location=Moncton|page=1}}</ref> Beaver testicles were used as medicine in Iraq and Iran during the tenth to nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12576209 | volume=85 | issue=1 | title=Traditional healing with animals (zootherapy): medieval to present-day Levantine practice | year=2003 | month=March | journal=J Ethnopharmacol | pages=107–18 | author=Lev E | doi=10.1016/S0378-8741(02)00377-X}}</ref> [[Claudius Aelianus]] comically described beavers chewing off their testicles to preserve themselves from hunters, which is not possible because the beaver's testicles are inside its body. European beavers (''[[Castor fiber]]'') were eventually hunted nearly to extinction in part for the production of castoreum, which was used as an [[analgesic]], [[anti-inflammatory]], and [[antipyretic]]. Castoreum was described in the 1911 [[British Pharmaceutical Codex]] for use in [[dysmenorrhea]] and [[hysteria|hysterical]] conditions (i.e. pertaining to the womb), for raising [[blood pressure]] and increasing [[cardiac output]]. The activity of castoreum has been credited to the accumulation of [[salicin]] from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to [[salicylic acid]] and has an action very similar to aspirin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/2005/03/28/S31/1/ |title=The quest for pain relief: how much have we improved on the past? |author=Stephen Pincock |date=28 March 2005 |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> Castoreum continues to be used in perfume production.

Castoreum is also used a natural flavoring because it can be manipulated to taste like vanilla and strawberry.<ref>http://www.honeycolony.com/article/natural-flavor-comes-from-a-beavers-butt/</ref>

Much of the early European exploration and trade of Canada was based on the quest for beaver.<ref>See [[Canadian canoe routes (early)]] and related articles.</ref> The most valuable part of the beaver is its inner fur whose many minute barbs make it excellent for [[felt]]ing, especially for hats. In Canada a 'made beaver' or ''castor gras'' that an Indian had worn or slept on was more valuable than a fresh skin since this tended to wear off the outer guard hairs.

===Trapping===
[[File:Fur trade museum beaver pelt.jpg|thumb|Fur trade museum beaver pelt]]
Beavers have been [[animal trapping|trapped]] for millennia, and this continues to this day.<ref name="myfoxchicago.com"/> Beaver [[fur|pelts]] were used for [[barter (economics)|barter]] by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the 17th century to gain European goods. They were then shipped back to Great Britain and France where they were made into clothing items. Widespread hunting and trapping of beavers led to their [[endangered species|endangerment]]. Eventually, the [[fur trade]] declined due to decreasing demand in Europe and the takeover of trapping grounds to support the growing agriculture sector. A small resurgence in beaver trapping has occurred in some areas where there is an over-population of beaver; trapping is done when the fur is of value, and the remainder of the animal may be used as feed. In the 1976/1977 season, 500,000 beaver pelts were harvested in North America.<ref>Nowak, Ronald M. 1991. pp. 638. ''Walker's Mammals of the World'' Fifth Edition, vol. I. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.</ref> <!--The only fur in North America which surpassing the beaver's in commercial value was that of the silver morph [[red fox]], which was said to be forty times more valuable.<ref name="NEC">{{cite book |author=Morton, Thomas |title=New English Canaan: Or, New Canaan (Research Library of Colonial Americana) |year=1972 |pages=188 |isbn=0-405-03309-5 |publisher=Arno Press |location=New York}}</ref> What period was this??

==In culture==
[[File:Blaeu - Nova Belgica et Anglia Nova (Detail Hudson Area).png|thumb|Beavers on a map of the [[Hudson River]] valley c. 1635]]
In wider culture, the beaver is famed for its industriousness. The English verb "to beaver" means to work hard and constantly.

===As a national emblem===
The importance of the beaver in the development of Canada through the fur trade led to its official designation as the [[List of national animals|national animal]] in 1975. The animal has long been associated with Canada, appearing on the coat of arms of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1678.<ref>{{cite web|last=White|first=Shelley|title=The Beaver As National Symbol: Why Is A Furry Mammal Still An Emblem of Canada?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/07/01/canadian-symbols-beaver_n_886777.html#s300503&title=Beaver|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> It is depicted on the [[Nickel (Canadian coin)|Canadian five-cent piece]] and was on the first pictorial postage stamp issued in the [[British North America|Canadian colonies]]  in 1849 (the so-called "[[Postage stamps and postal history of Canada|Three-Penny Beaver]]"). As a [[national symbol]], the beaver was chosen to be the mascot of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Montreal]] with the name "Amik" ("beaver" in [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]). The beaver is also the symbol of many units and organizations within the [[Canadian Forces]], such as on the cap badges of the [[Royal 22e Régiment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> Régiment]] and the [[Canadian Military Engineers]]. [[Toronto Police Services]], [[London Police Service]], [[Canadian Pacific Railway Police Service]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] bear the beaver on their crest or coat of arms.

===In dietary law===
In the 17th century, based on a question raised by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]], the Roman Catholic Church ruled that the beaver was a fish (beaver flesh was a part of the indigenous peoples' diet, prior to the Europeans' arrival) for purposes of dietary law. Therefore, the general prohibition on the consumption of meat on Fridays during [[Lent]] did not apply to beaver meat.<ref>[http://www.chowdc.org/Papers/Saunders%202001.html]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmyakin.org/2005/02/lent_roundup.html |title=Lenten Reader Roundup |publisher=Jimmy Akin.Org |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{fr icon}}Lacoursière, Jacques.

===In computer science===
In [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]], a ''[[busy beaver]]'' (from the colloquial expression for "industrious person") is a [[Turing machine]] that attains the maximum "operational busyness" (such as measured by the number of steps performed, or the number of nonblank symbols finally on the tape) among all the Turing machines in a certain class.
