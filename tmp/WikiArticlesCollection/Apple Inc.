During the first five years of operations, revenues doubled every four months, an average growth rate of 700%.

The [[Apple II series|Apple II]], also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]].

Jobs and several Apple employees, including [[Jef Raskin]], visited [[Xerox PARC]] in December 1979 to see the [[Xerox Alto]].

Apple began working on the [[Apple Lisa]] in 1978. In 1982, Jobs was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Jobs took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the [[Macintosh]]. A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.<ref name="lemlisa">Hormby, Thomas.

Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a [[coup]] and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.<ref name="lem1985" /> Jobs resigned from Apple and founded [[NeXT|NeXT Inc.]] the same year.<ref>{{cite news| last = Spector| first = G| title = Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market| work = [[PC Week]]| page = 109| date = September 24, 1985}}</ref>

[[File:Macintosh portable.jpg|thumb|The [[Macintosh Portable]] was Apple's first "portable" Macintosh computer, released in 1989.]]
The [[Macintosh Portable]] was introduced in 1989 and was designed to be just as powerful as a desktop Macintosh, but weighed a bulky {{convert|7.5|kg}} with a 12-hour battery life. After the Macintosh Portable, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]] in 1991. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for [[Mac OS]] until 2001.

The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.<ref name="lemsculley" /> For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the Macintosh.

Following the success of the [[Macintosh LC]], Apple introduced the [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, a low-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]], and the ill-fated [[Performa]] line that was sold with an overwhelming number of configurations and software bundles to avoid competing with the various consumer outlets such as [[Sears]], [[Price Club]], and [[Wal-Mart]] (the primary dealers for these models). Consumers ended up confused and did not understand the difference between models.<ref name="vawperforma">{{cite web| title=Macintosh Performa|url=http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html| publisher= Vectronics Apple World| accessdate= November 29, 2010}}</ref>

During this time Apple experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted products including [[QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]]. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued [[Newton (platform)|Newton division]] based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ultimately, none of these products helped, as Apple's market share and stock prices continued to slide.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Apple saw the [[Apple II series]] as too expensive to produce, while taking away sales from the low-end Macintosh.<ref name="apple2history11">{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html#11|title=Apple II History Chap 11|accessdate=August 12, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080912044443/http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html| archivedate= September 12, 2008| deadurl= no}}</ref> In 1990, Apple released the [[Macintosh LC]] with a single [[expansion slot]] for the [[Apple IIe Card]] to migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform.<ref name="apple2history11" /> Apple stopped selling the [[Apple IIe]] in 1993.

[[File:Newton-IMG 0320 cleanup.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] was Apple's first foray into the [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] markets, as well as one of the first in the industry.

By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as the [[A/UX]]. Apple had also begun to experiment in providing a Mac-only online portal which they called [[eWorld]], developed in collaboration with [[America Online]] and designed as a Mac-friendly alternative to other online services such as [[CompuServe]]. The Macintosh platform was itself becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking, and several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors such as [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html| title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall|accessdate=August 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080924063130/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html| archivedate= September 24, 2008| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1994, Apple allied with IBM and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]]. The goal was to create a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple's software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's [[PowerPC]] processor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&model=6100&performa=off&sort=date&order=ASC&range=|title=Power Macintosh 6100|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}</ref>

Apple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80. In January 2006, Apple's [[market cap]] surpassed that of [[Dell]].<ref name="modell">Gamet, Jeff.

===2007–11: Widespread success===
Apple achieved widespread success with its [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPad]] products, which introduced innovations in [[mobile phone]]s, [[portable music player]]s and [[personal computer]]s respectively. In addition, the implementation of a store for the purchase of software applications represented a new [[business model]]. [[Touch screen]]s had been invented and seen in mobile devices before, but Apple was the first to achieve mass market adoption of such a [[user interface]] that included particular pre-programmed touch gestures.

Delivering his keynote speech at the [[Macworld Expo]] on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would from that point on be known as Apple Inc., because computers were no longer the main focus of the company, which had shifted its emphasis to mobile electronic devices.

Apple released the [[iPhone 4|fourth generation iPhone]], which introduced [[video calling]], [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]], and a new [[Electrical insulation|uninsulated]] [[stainless steel]] design, which acts as the phone's antenna. Because of this antenna implementation, some iPhone 4 users reported a reduction in signal strength when the phone is held in specific ways.

In March 2012, one of the largest cellular phone companies in the United States, [[T-Mobile]], announced that it would begin selling the iPhone 5 on April 12 of that year.

Before the iPhone became available for direct purchase, ready made for [[T-Mobile]]'s service, millions of their users used unlocked devices.

The phone went on sale on November 8 at [[U.S. Cellular]] stores around the country.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Cellular Gets The iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c on November 8th|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/18/u-s-cellular-gets-the-iphone-5s-and-iphone-5c-on-november-8th/|publisher=TCTV|date=October 18, 2013|author=Matthew Panzarino}}</ref>

===Apple TV===
{{Main|Apple TV}}
[[File:AppleTV top2.png|thumb|The current generation Apple TV.]]
At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]], (previously known as the iTV),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher=Apple.com |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, includes outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and plays video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09appletv.html |title= Apple TV Coming to Your Living Room |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate= October 7, 2011}}</ref> On May 31, 2007 a 160 GB drive was released alongside the existing 40&nbsp;GB model<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30appletv.html |title=YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> and on January 15, 2008 a software update was released, which allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15appletv.html |title=Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software & Lowers Price to $229 |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>

In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, alongside the release of the new line of iPod devices for the year, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache (computing)|cache]] media downloaded. Apple with the Apple TV has added another device to its portfolio that runs on its A4 processor along with the iPad and the iPhone. The memory included in the device is the half of the [[iPhone 4]] at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third- and fourth-generation [[iPod Touch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/|first=Ross |last=Miller|title=Apple TV teardown reveals 8GB flash storage, 256MB RAM, leftover iPad parts|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010|publisher=AOL |work=[[Engadget]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101002001956/http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/| archivedate= October 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref>

It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including YouTube and Netflix, and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.

===Software===
{{See also|List of Macintosh software}}
Apple develops its own [[operating system]] to run on Macs, [[OS X]], the latest version being [[OS X Mavericks]] (version 10.9). Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its OS X operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles [[iMovie]], [[iPhoto]] and [[GarageBand]]. For presentation, page layout and word processing, [[iWork]] is available, which includes [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]], [[Pages (iWork)|Pages]], and [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]]. iTunes, [[QuickTime]] media player, and [[Software Update]] are available as free downloads for both OS X and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system [[OS X Server]]; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote systems management application; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creative market, there is [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] for professional [[Raw image format|RAW]]-format [[photo]] processing; [[Final Cut Pro]], a video production suite; [[Logic Pro]], a comprehensive music toolkit; and [[Motion (software)|Motion]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[iCloud]], which provides cloud storage and syncing for a wide range of data, including email, contacts, calendars, photos and documents. It also offers iOS device backup, and is able to integrate directly with third-party apps for even greater functionality. iCloud is the fourth generation of online services provided by Apple, and was preceded by [[MobileMe]], .Mac and iTools, all which met varying degrees of success.

According to Steve Jobs, Apple was so named because Jobs was coming back from an apple farm, and he was on a [[fruitarian]] diet. He thought the name was "fun, spirited and not intimidating".<ref>{{cite news|title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html|accessdate=October 21, 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=October 20, 2011}}</ref>

Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the "bitten" logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. While Jobs liked the logo, he insisted it be in color to humanize the company.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597|title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion | date=September 26, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zlok.net/blog/2009/03/29/i-invented-the-apple-logo/|title=ZLOK Logo Design Blog: I Invented&nbsp;... the Apple Logo}}</ref> The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.<ref name="creativebits_interview">{{cite web|url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo|title= Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo|first=Ivan|last=Raszl}}</ref> The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.<ref name="creativebits_interview" /> This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising |location=UK |work=The Independent |accessdate=September 14, 2009 | date=January 4, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091003003651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html| archivedate= October 3, 2009| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://replay.web.archive.org/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html|title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff | date=March 14, 2005}}</ref> Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.<ref name="creativebits_interview"/><ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Leavitt|2007|p=280}}</ref>

In 1998, with the roll-out of the new iMac, Apple discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation, on various products, packaging and advertising. An [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 2001 to 2003, and a Glass-themed version was used from 2003 to 2013. With the release of iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks in fall of 2013, the logo appears flat and white with no glossy effects.

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were [[The Beatles|Beatles]] fans,<ref>{{cite news | last = Moses | first = Asher | title = Who was Steve Jobs the man? |work=The Age | location=Melbourne | url = http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/who-was-steve-jobs-the-man-20111007-1lcrx.html | accessdate =October 7, 2011 | date=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Tearful memories for Apple co-founder |work=The Age | location=Melbourne | url = http://media.theage.com.au/news/world-news/tearful-memories-for-apple-cofounder-2675550.html | accessdate =October 7, 2011}}</ref> but Apple Inc. had trademark issues with [[Apple Corps|Apple Corps Ltd.]], a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1967, involving their name and logo. This resulted in a [[Apple Corps v Apple Computer|series of lawsuits]] and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007.

Since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 Super Bowl commercial]] to the more modern '[[Get a Mac]]' adverts, Apple has been recognized in the past for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products, though its [[Apple Inc. advertising#Criticism|advertising was criticized]] for the claims made by some later campaigns, particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devproconnections.com/article/apple/bbb-tells-apple-to-halt-misleading-ads.aspx|title=BBB Tells Apple to Halt Misleading Ads|publisher=DevPro|date=March 29, 2004|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3797261.stm|title=Apple Power Mac ads 'misleading' |work=BBC News | date=June 11, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2192019/asa-clears-apple-ads|title=UK watchdog clears Apple ads|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110012153/http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2192019/asa-clears-apple-ads|archivedate=January 10, 2008}}</ref> and iPhone ads in Britain.

Apple's [[brand loyalty]] is considered unusual for any product. At one time, [[Apple evangelist]]s were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. Apple evangelist [[Guy Kawasaki]] has called the brand fanaticism "something that was stumbled upon".<ref>{{cite web|author=Huba, Jackie; McConnell, Ben|url=http://www.creatingcustomerevangelists.com/resources/evangelists/guy_kawasaki.asp|title=The father of evangelism marketing|publisher=Church of the Customer|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref> Apple has, however, supported the continuing existence of a network of [[Macintosh User Group|Mac User Groups]] in most major and many minor centers of population where Mac computers are available.

Mac users would meet at the European [[Apple Expo]] and the San Francisco [[Macworld Conference & Expo]] trade shows where Apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until Apple pulled out of both events. While the conferences continue, Apple does not have official representation there. Mac developers, in turn, continue to gather at the annual Apple [[Worldwide Developers Conference]].

[[Apple Store]] openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/12/61513 |title=Apple Store: Chain of Devotion |work=Wired |author=Kahney, Leander |date=December 10, 2003 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> The New York City [[Fifth Avenue]] "Cube" store had a line as long as half a mile; a few Mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/fifth_avenue/index.html |title=ifo Apple Store – Fifth Avenue Grand Opening |publisher=Ifoapplestore.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> The [[Ginza]] opening in Tokyo was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple in Osaka: another huge opening|url=http://www.japanconsuming.com/news/040828.html|publisher=JapanConsuming|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528200249/http://www.japanconsuming.com/news/040828.html|archivedate=May 28, 2008}}</ref>

Books from [[John Wiley & Sons]], who publishes the [[For Dummies]] series of instructional books, are a notable exception, however.

On October 15, 2013 it was announced that the Cupertino City Council has approved the proposed "spaceship" design campus. On June 7, 2011, Steve Jobs gave a presentation to Cupertino City Council, detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs. The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central four-storied circular building (with a café for 3,000 sitting people integrated) surrounded by extensive landscape (with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure). The new campus will be built on the former HP headquarters, next to Interstate 280.The morning of the announcement, Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted "Our home for innovation and creativity for decades to come.

===Corporate culture===
Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a [[corporate culture]] should look like in organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal attire, etc.). Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Microsoft]]. Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like [[IBM]] by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; Steve Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple was a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the [[1984 (television commercial)|"1984" TV ad]], this trait had become a key way the company attempted to differentiate itself from its competitors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deutschman|first=Alan|title=The once and future Steve Jobs|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/|work=Salon.com|accessdate=November 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202183854/http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/| archivedate= December 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref> According to a 2011 report in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]],'' this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.<ref name=Fortune1>{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup|title=How Apple works: inside the world's largest startup|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=August 25, 2011}}</ref>

As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ. This was especially after Jobs' return. To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program, awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],<ref name="hertzfeld">[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a "directly responsible individual," or "DRI" in Apple jargon.<ref name=Fortune1/> As an example, when iOS senior vice president [[Scott Forstall]] refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned [[Maps (application)|Maps app]], he was forced to resign.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|title=Inside Apple's major shakeup|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/29/inside-apples-major-shakeup/|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>

Numerous employees of Apple have cited that projects without Jobs' involvement often took longer than projects with his involvement.<ref name="cultofmacwork">{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple|title=What It's Like To Work At Apple|first=John|last=Brownlee|date=July 7, 2010}}</ref>

At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having best-in-class employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]] who was Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011, was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet he had no control of the inventory in his stores (which is done company wide by then-COO and now CEO [[Tim Cook]] who has a background in supply-chain management). This is the opposite of [[General Electric]]'s corporate culture which has created well-rounded managers.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ |title=How Apple works: Inside the world's biggest startup – Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Under the leadership of [[Tim Cook]] who joined the company in 1998 and ascended to his present position as CEO, Apple has developed an extremely efficient and effective supply chain which has been ranked as the world's best for the four years 2007–2010.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enables it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories; Apple's profit margins have been 40 percent compared with 10–20 percent for most other hardware companies in 2011. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational edge is “Nobody wants to buy sour milk”.<ref name=supply/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/11/09/ruthlessness-and-lasers-apples-supply-chain-revealed/ |title=Ruthlessness and lasers: Apple's supply chain revealed &#124; Smart Shift &#124; Executive &#124; Financial Post |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}</ref>

The company previously advertised its products as being made in America up to the late 1990s, however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s almost all of its manufacturing is now done abroad. According to a report by the [[New York Times]], Apple insiders "believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple products".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Charles | last1=Duhigg | first2=Keith | last2=Bradsher | title=Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class | date=January 21, 2012}}</ref>

Unlike other major US companies, Apple has a relatively simple compensation policy for executives, which does not include perks that other CEOs enjoy such as country club fees and private use of company aircraft. The company usually grants stock options to executives every other year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/apple-ceo-gets-modest-2012-pay-after-huge-2011-1.1092906|title=Apple CEO gets modest 2012 pay after huge 2011|date=December 27, 2012}}</ref>

A media article published in July 2013 provided details about Apple's "At-Home Apple Advisors" customer support program that serves as the corporation's call center. The advisors are employed within the U.S. and work remotely after undergoing a four-week training program that also serves as a testing period. The advisors earn between US$9 and $12 per hour, and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Apple Gets At-Home Workers To Work|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/28/how-apple-gets-at-home-workers-to-work/?ncid=tcdaily|work=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=July 29, 2013|author=Ashley Verrill|date=July 28, 2013}}</ref>

===Litigation===
{{main|Apple Inc. litigation}}
{{expand section|date=July 2013}}

Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation and, like its competitors and peers, engages in litigation (trying legal cases before the courts) in its normal course of business for a variety of reasons. In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests.

Some examples include [[Apple v. Samsung]], [[Apple v. Microsoft]], [[Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.|Motorola v. Apple]], [[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer]].

===Finance===
In its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108 billion in annual revenues – a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion – and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves. Apple achieved these results while losing market share in certain product categories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/6a7cac22-31db-11e1-9be2-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz1iGo2qA2S |title=Apple in race to keep ahead in 2012 |date=December 29, 2011}}</ref> On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.<ref name=dividendfaq>{{cite news|last=Tsukayama|first=Hayley|title=FAQ: Apple's Dividend|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/faq-apples-dividend/2012/03/20/gIQAVxMgPS_story.html?tid=pm_business_pop|accessdate=March 21, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 20, 2012}}</ref>

====Climate change and clean energy====
On April 21, 2011, [[Greenpeace]] released a report highlighting the fact that data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase.

In 2010, [[Climate Counts]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category "Striding".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecounts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=7 |title=Climate Counts scorecard |publisher=Climatecounts.org |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a "stuck icon", adding that Apple at the time was "a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer".<ref name="iwclimate">{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/mac/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601672|title=Environmental Group Hits Apple}}</ref>

In 2006, the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' reported on the working conditions that existed at factories in China where the contract manufacturers [[Foxconn]] and [[Inventec]] produced the iPod.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-401234/The-stark-reality-iPods-Chinese-factories.html |title=The Stark Reality of iPod's Chinese Factories |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=August 18, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=<!-- None -->}}</ref> The article stated that one complex of factories that assembles the iPod (among other items) had over 200,000 workers that lived and worked in the factory, with employees regularly working more than 60 hours per week. The article also reported that workers made around $100 per month and were required to live pay for rent and food from the company, which generally amounted to a little over half of workers' earnings.<ref name="wpsweatshop">{{Cite journal |last=Musgrove |first=Mike |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/15/AR2006061501898.html |title=Sweatshop Conditions at IPod Factory Reported |work=The Washington Post |date=June 16, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=<!-- None -->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kahney |first=Leander |url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2006/06/71138 |title=Judging Apple Sweatshop Charge |publisher=Wired |date=June 13, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=<!-- None -->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dean |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118677584137994489.html?mod=blog |title=The Forbidden City of Terry Gou |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 11, 2007 |ref=harv |postscript=<!-- None -->|publisher=Wired|accessdate=November 13, 2010|date=November 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101104233204/http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/11/foxconn-photo-gallery/?pid=731&viewall=true| archivedate= November 4, 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Apple created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]] to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to the ''New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the "[[Double Irish arrangement#Dutch sandwich|Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich]]," which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.<ref>Duhigg, Charles (April 29, 2012)[ "How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes."] ''New York Times.'' (Retrieved 4-20-12.)</ref>

[[British Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament [[Charlie Elphicke]] published research on October 30, 2012,<ref>{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Roland|title=Foreign companies 'avoid billions in corporation tax'|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3583772.ece|newspaper=The Times|date=October 30, 2012}}</ref> which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard [[corporation tax]]. He followed this research by calling on the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to force these multinationals, which also included [[Google]] and [[Coca-Cola]], to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebrahimi|first=Helia|title=Foreign firms could owe UK £11bn in unpaid taxes|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/9652516/Foreign-firms-could-owe-UK-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=November 2, 2012}}</ref>

===Charitable causes===
As of 2012, Apple is listed as a partner of the [[Product RED]] campaign, together with other brands such as Nike, Girl, American Express and Converse. The campaign's mission is to prevent the transmission of [[HIV]] from mother to child by 2015 (its byline is "Fighting For An AIDS Free Generation").<ref>{{cite web|title=(RED) Partners|url=http://www.joinred.com/aboutred/red-partners/|work=(RED)|publisher=(RED), a division of The ONE Campaign|accessdate=October 13, 2012|year=2012}}</ref>

In November 2012, Apple donated $2.5 million to the [[American Red Cross]] to aid relief efforts after [[Hurricane Sandy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Seth|title=Apple donates $2.5M to Hurricane Sandy relief|url=http://9to5mac.com/2012/11/09/apple-donates-2-5-million-to-hurricane-sandy-relief/|publisher=9to5Mac|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}</ref>
