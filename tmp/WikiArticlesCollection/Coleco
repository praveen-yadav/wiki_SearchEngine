==History==
Coleco originally processed shoe leather, which later led to a business in [[leather crafting|leather craft kits]] in the 1950s. They began manufacturing plastic moulding and moved into plastic wading pools in the 1960s. The leather part of the business was then sold off.<ref>{{cite news|title= Coleco moves out of the cabbage patch|work= The New York Times|date=1985-07-21|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/21/business/coleco-moves-out-of-the-cabbage-patch.html?&pagewanted=all|accessdate=2010-09-01 | first=N. R. | last=Kleinfield}}</ref>
   
Under CEO [[Arnold Greenberg (Coleco)|Arnold Greenberg]], the company entered the [[video game console]] business with the [[Coleco Telstar|Telstar]] in 1976. Dozens of companies were introducing game systems that year after [[Atari]]'s successful [[Pong]] console. Nearly all of these new games were based on [[General Instrument]]'s "Pong-on-a-chip". However, General Instrument had underestimated demand, and there were severe shortages. Coleco had been one of the first to place an order, and was one of the few companies to receive an order in full. Though dedicated game consoles did not last long on the market, their early order enabled Coleco to [[break-even|break even]].

Coleco continued to do well in electronics. They transitioned next into [[handheld electronic game]]s, a market popularized by [[Mattel]]. Coleco produced two very popular lines of games, the "head to head" series of two player sports games, (Football, Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, Hockey) and the Mini-Arcade series of licensed [[Arcade game|video arcade]] titles such as ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''. A third line of educational handhelds was also produced and included the Electronic Learning Machine, Lil Genius, Digits, and a trivia game called Quiz Wiz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Coleco |title=Coleco Handheld Games |publisher=Handheldmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref> Launched in 1982, their first four [[handheld electronic game|tabletop]] Mini-Arcades, for ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Galaxian]]'', ''Donkey Kong'', and ''[[Frogger]]'', sold approximately three million units within a year.<ref name="eg_16_10">{{cite journal|title=More Mini-Arcades A Comin'|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|year=1983|month=June|volume=4|issue=16|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n9/mode/2up|accessdate=1 February 2012|page=10}}</ref> Among these, 1.5 million units were sold for ''Pac-Man'' alone.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mini-Arcades 'Go Gold'|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|year=1982|month=November|volume=1|issue=9|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-11/Electronic_Games_Issue_09_Vol_01_09_1982_Nov#page/n11/mode/2up|accessdate=5 February 2012|page=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Coleco Mini-Arcades Go Gold|journal=Arcade Express|date=August 15, 1982|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/newsletters/arcadeexpress/arcade_express_v1n1.pdf|accessdate=3 February 2012|page=4}}</ref> In 1983, they released three more Mini-Arcades: for ''Ms. Pac-Man'', ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.|Donkey Kong Junior]]'', and ''[[Zaxxon]]''.<ref name="eg_16_10"/>

Coleco returned to the video game console market in 1982 with the launch of the [[ColecoVision]]. While the system was quite popular, Coleco hedged their bet on video games by introducing a line of [[ROM cartridge]]s for the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]]. They also introduced the [[Coleco Gemini]], a clone of the popular Atari 2600.

When the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game business began to implode in 1983]], it seemed clear that video game consoles were being supplanted by [[home computer]]s. Coleco's strategy was to introduce the [[Coleco Adam]] home computer, both as a stand-alone system and as an expansion module to the ColecoVision. This effort failed, in large part because Adams were often unreliable. The Adam flopped; Coleco withdrew from electronics early in 1985.<ref name="Woutat"/>

Also in 1983, Coleco released the [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] series of dolls which were wildly successful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=213040&c=10|title=Cleveland's Cabbage Patch Kids turn 25|date=AccessNorthGA.com|publisher=2008-09-07|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> Flush with their success, in 1986 they purchased beleaguered [[Selchow & Righter]], manufacturers of [[Scrabble]], [[Parcheesi]], and [[Trivial Pursuit]],<ref>{{Cite news

That same year, Coleco introduced an ALF plush based on the furry alien character who had [[ALF (TV series)|his own television series]] at the time, as well as a talking version and a cassette-playing "Storytelling ALF" doll.<ref>{{cite news|title= Coleco Plays The Odds, Pays For Ads For 'Alf' |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1986-08-26|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-26/entertainment/ca-17809_1_alf-products|accessdate=2010-08-26 | first=Morgan | last=Gendel}}</ref> The combination of the purchase of Selchow and Righter, the disastrous Adam computer, and the public's waning infatuation with Cabbage Patch dolls contributed to Coleco's financial decline. In 1988, the company filed for [[chapter 11]] bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite news|title= Cabbage Patch Doll Maker Is Bankrupt |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1988-07-12|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-12/news/mn-5746_1_cabbage-patch-kids|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>

The reorganized Coleco sold off all of its North American assets and outsourced thousands of jobs to foreign countries, closing plants in [[Amsterdam, New York]] and other cities.<ref>{{cite news|title= BRIEFLY |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1988-07-04|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-04/business/fi-4010_1_cabbage-patch-kids-dolls|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> In 1989, [[Hasbro]]  and Canada based SLM Action Sports Inc. purchased Coleco's assets.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D8113BF930A25754C0A96F948260

In 2005, River West Brands, a [[Chicago]]-based [[brand]] revitalization company, re-introduced Coleco to the marketplace. In late 2006, they introduced the [[Coleco Sonic]], a handheld system containing twenty [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Game Gear]] games.
