He is also called the second Apostle of the [[Prussia]]ns ([[Old Prussians]]).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Boniface was from a noble family of [[Querfurt]] (now in  [[Saxony-Anhalt]]). He is rumored to have been a relative of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. At the age of six he was sent to be educated in [[Magdeburg]], seat of [[Adalbert of Magdeburg]], the teacher and namesake of [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert]]. While still a youth he was made a canon of Magdeburg cathedral. The fifteen-year-old Otto III made Bruno a part of his royal court. While in Rome for Otto's imperial coronation, Bruno met [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert of Prague]], the first Apostle of the Prussians, killed a year later, which inspired Bruno to write a biography of St Adalbert when he reached the recently Christianized and consolidated [[Kingdom of Hungary]] himself. Bruno spent much time at the monastery where Adalbert had become a monk and where abbot [[John Canaparius]] may have written a life of Saint Adalbert. Later, Bruno entered a monastery near [[Ravenna]], founded by Otto, and underwent severe [[ascetic]] training under the guidance of [[Saint Romuald|St. Romuald]].

===Missionary life===
[[Image:Pomeraniae Ducatus Tabula.jpg|thumb|450px|The lands given St. Bruno in 1003 were in the region shown on left bank of the Oder, [[Hither Pomerania]] along the coast, or the future [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] to its south.]]
In [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] hoped to open a monastery between the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder]] (somewhere in the  [[Paganism|pagan]] lands that became [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] or Western <!-- don't join as [[Western Pomerania]]... the generic name is the only one with a map applicable to the era-->[[Pomerania]]) to help convert the local population into Christianity. In 1003 [[Pope Sylvester II]] appointed Bruno, at the age of 33, to head a mission amongst the pagan peoples of Eastern Europe. Owing to a regional conflict between the [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Henry II]] and [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Duke Boleslaus I of Poland]] he delayed the plans for the monastery, and so Bruno set out for [[Hungary]]. There he went to the places that Saint Adalbert of Prague had attended. Bruno tried to get [[Ahtum]], the Duke of [[Banat]], who was under jurisdiction of [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] to get under jurisdiction of [[Patriarchate of Rome]], but this precipitated a large controversy leading to organized opposition from local monks. Bruno elected to gracefully exit the region after he first finished his book, the famous ''"Life of [[Saint Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]],"'' a literary memorial of much worth giving a history of the (relatively recent) conversion of the Hungarians.

After this diplomatic failure, Bruno went to [[Kiev]], where Grand Duke [[Vladimir I, Prince of Kiev|Vladimir I]] authorized him to make [[Christian]] converts among the [[Pechenegs]], semi-nomadic [[Turkic peoples]] living between the [[Danube]] and the [[Don River, Russia|Don]] rivers. Bruno spent five months there and baptized some thirty adults. He helped to bring about a peace treaty between them and the ruler of Kiev.

Before leaving for Poland, Bruno [[Consecration|consecrated]] a bishop for the [[Pechenegs]]. While in Poland he consecrated the first [[Bishop of Sweden]] and is said to have sent emissaries to baptize the king of Sweden,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DC0aAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA142&dq=Bruno+von+Querfurt+olaf&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1900&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES Bruno of Querfurt, baptism of king of Sweden]</ref> whose mother had come from Poland. Bruno found out that his friend Benedict and four companions had been killed by robbers in 1003. Bruno took eyewitness accounts and wrote down a touching history of the so-called Five Martyred Brothers.

===Mission to Prussia and death===
In the autumn or at the end of 1008 Bruno and eighteen companions set out to found a mission among the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]; they succeeded in converting [[Netimer]], a "king of Lithuanians", and then traveled to the east, heading very likely towards [[Yotvingians|Yotvingia]]. Yotvingia was a Prussian region, then subordinate to [[Kievan Rus]] (since 983), that intersected the borders of what was then [[Old Prussia|Prussia]], Kievan Rus and the [[Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref>According to the "Annals of Magdeburg" (c. 1170) and some other sources.</ref>

Saint Bruno was [[decapitation|beheaded]] on February 14, 1009, whereas most of his companions were hanged the same day by Zebeden, brother of newly-converted Netimer. Duke [[Boleslaus the Brave]] brought the bodies to Poland (it was supposed that they were laid to rest in [[Przemyśl]], where some historians place Bruno's diocese; such localization of the Bruno's burial place is hardly probable because Przemyśl then belonged to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Kievan Rus through 1018). The ''"Annals of Magdeburg,"'' ''"Thietmar of Merseburg's Chronicle,"'' various works of Magdeburg Bishops, the ''"[[Annals of Quedlinburg]]"'' and many other written sources of 11th-15th centuries record this story.

Soon after his death, Bruno and his companions were venerated as martyrs and Bruno was soon after [[canonized]]. It was said that [[Braunsberg]] was named after St Bruno.
