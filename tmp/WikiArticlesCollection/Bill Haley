'''William John Clifton Haley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|l|iː}}; July 6, 1925 – February 9, 1981) — known as '''Bill Haley''' — was an American [[rock and roll]] musician. He is credited by many with first popularizing this form of music in the early 1950s with his group [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] (inspired by [[Halley's Comet]]) and million selling hits such as, ''[[Rock Around the Clock]]'', ''[[See You Later, Alligator]]'', ''[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]'', ''[[Skinny Minnie]]'', and ''Razzle Dazzle''. He has sold over 25 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seite3.ch/Bill+Haley+Radaumusiker/427172/detail.html |title=Radaumusiker |publisher=seite3.ch|accessdate=2013-04-09}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Bill Haley was born July 6, 1925 in Highland Park, Michigan as William John Clifton Haley. Because of the effects of the Great Depression on the Detroit area, his father moved the family to [[Boothwyn, Pennsylvania|Boothwyn]], near [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Pennsylvania]], when Bill was seven years old. Haley's father William Albert Haley was from [[Kentucky]] and played the [[banjo]] and [[mandolin]], and his mother, Maude Green, who was originally from [[Ulverston]] in [[Lancashire]], [[England]], was a technically accomplished keyboardist with classical training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/haley.html|title=Bill Haley and his Comets|publisher=Classic Bands}}</ref> Haley told the story that when he made a simulated guitar out of cardboard, his parents bought him a real one.<ref>Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. pages 15,17. ISBN 0-8128-2909-3</ref> 

The anonymous sleeve notes accompanying the 1956 Decca album "Rock Around The Clock" describe Haley's early life and career thus: "Bill got his first professional job at the age of 13, playing and entertaining at an auction for the fee of $1 a night. Very soon after this he formed a group of equally enthusiastic youngsters and managed to get quite a few local bookings for his band."

The sleeve notes continue: "When Bill Haley was fifteen [c.1940] he left home with his guitar and very little else and set out on the hard road to fame and fortune. The next few years, continuing this story in a fairy-tale manner, were hard and poverty-stricken, but crammed full of useful experience. Apart from learning how to exist on one meal a day and other artistic exercises, he worked at an open-air park show, sang and yodelled with any band that would have him, and worked with a traveling medicine show. Eventually he got a job with a popular group known as the "Down Homers" while they were in Hartford, Connecticut. Soon after this he decided, as all successful people must decide at some time or another, to be his own boss again - and he has been that ever since.’ [Note: these notes fail to account for his early band, known as the Four Aces of Western Swing. During the 1940s Haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in America as "Silver Yodeling Bill Haley".]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=13813 |title=Bill Haley and the Saddlemen |publisher=Hillbilly-Music.com |date=1981-02-09 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

The sleeve notes conclude: "For six years Bill Haley was a musical director of Radio Station WPWA in Chester, Pennsylvania, and led his own band all through this period. It was then known as Bill Haley's Saddlemen, indicating their definite leaning toward the tough Western style. They continued playing in clubs as well as over the radio around [[Philadelphia]], and in 1951 made their first recordings on Ed Wilson's Keystone Records in Philadelphia."

===Bill Haley & His Comets===
[[Image:Bill Haley, 1974, Liége 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Bill Haley and the Comets performing during 1974]]
{{main|Bill Haley & His Comets}}
During the [[Labor Day]] weekend in 1952, the Saddlemen were renamed '''Bill Haley with Haley's Comets''' (inspired by a popular mispronunciation of [[Halley's Comet]]), and in 1953, Haley's recording of "[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]" (co-written by Haley and his bass player, [[Marshall Lytle]] although Lytle would not receive credit until 2001) became the first rock and roll song to hit the American charts, peaking at no.15 on Billboard and no.11 on Cash Box. Soon after, the band's name was revised to '''Bill Haley & His Comets.'''

In 1953, a song called "[[(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock|Rock Around the Clock]]" was written for Haley.<ref>Dawson 2005</ref> He was unable to record it until April 12, 1954. Initially, it was relatively unsuccessful, staying at the charts for only one week, but Haley soon scored a major worldwide hit with a cover version of [[Big Joe Turner]]'s "[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]", which went on to sell a million copies and became the first ever rock 'n' roll song to enter [[United Kingdom|British]] singles charts in December 1954 and became a Gold Record. He retained elements of the original, but threw some country music aspects into the song (specifically, Western Swing) and cleaned up the lyrics. Haley and his band were important in launching the music known as "Rock and Roll" to a wider, mostly white audience after a period of it being considered an underground genre. When "Rock Around the Clock" appeared behind the opening credits of the 1955 film ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' starring [[Glenn Ford]], it soared to the top of the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart for eight weeks. The single is commonly used as a convenient line of demarcation between the "rock era" and the music industry that preceded it; ''Billboard'' separated its statistical tabulations into 1890-1954 and 1955–present. After the record rose to number one, Haley was quickly given the title "Father of Rock and Roll" by the media, and by teenagers who had come to embrace the new style of music. With the song's success, the age of rock music began overnight and instantly ended the dominance of the jazz and pop standards performed by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Jo Stafford]], [[Perry Como]], [[Bing Crosby]] and others.

Success came at somewhat of a price as the new music confused and horrified most people over the age of 30, leading to [[Cold War]]-fueled suspicion that rock-and-roll was part of a [[communist]] plot to corrupt the minds of American teenagers. [[FBI]] chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]] attempted to dig up incriminating material on Bill Haley, who took to carrying a gun with him on tours for his own safety.

"Rock Around the Clock" was the first record ever to sell over one million copies in both [[UK|Britain]] and [[West Germany|Germany]] and, in 1957, Haley became the first major American rock singer to tour [[Europe]]. Haley continued to score hits throughout the 1950s such as "[[See You Later, Alligator]]" and he starred in the first rock and roll musical films ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'', both in 1956. Haley was already 30 years old and so he was soon eclipsed in the United States by the younger, sexier [[Elvis Presley]], but continued to enjoy great popularity in [[Latin America]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]] during the 1960s.

===Death and legacy===
A self-admitted [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] (as indicated in a 1974 radio interview for the [[BBC]]), Haley fought a battle with alcohol into the 1970s. Nonetheless, he and his band continued to be a popular touring act, benefiting from a 1950s nostalgia movement that began in the late 1960s and the signing of a lucrative record deal with the European [[Sonet Records]] label. After performing for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[Royal Variety Performance]] on November 10, 1979, Haley made his final performances in [[South Africa]] in May and June 1980. Before the South African tour, he was diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]], and a planned tour of Germany in the autumn of 1980 was cancelled. 

The October 25, 1980 edition of the German paper ''Bild'' reported that Haley had a brain tumor. It quoted British manager Patrick Maylan as saying that Haley "had taken a fit and went over the seat. He didn't recognize anyone anymore" after being taken to his home in Beverly Hills. It also reported that a doctor at the clinic where Haley had been taken said, "The tumor can't be operated on anymore."<ref name="Bill Haley 1982. page 154">Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. page 154. ISBN 0-8128-2909-3</ref>

"The Berliner Zeitung" reported a few days later that Haley had collapsed after a performance in Texas and been taken to the hospital in his home town of [[Harlingen, Texas]].<ref name="Bill Haley 1982. page 154"/> However this account is questionable as Bill Haley did not perform in the United States at all in 1980.

Despite his ill health, Haley began compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. 

However, the brain tumor soon began affecting his behavior and Haley went back to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]], where he died early in the morning of February 9, 1981.

Martha, Bill's widow, who was with him in these troubling times, denies he had a brain tumor as does his old, very close friend, Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Bill did not want to go on the road any more and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. According to McCallum, "It's my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card."

It was obvious that his drinking problem was getting worse. By this time, Bill and Martha fought all the time and she told him to stop drinking or move out. He then did move out into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. "There were days we never saw him," said his daughter Martha Maria.

In addition to Haley's drinking problems, it had also become obvious that he was having serious mental problems as well; Martha Maria said that, "It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking." After he'd been jailed by the Harlingen Police, Martha had the judge put Haley in the hospital where he was seen by a psychiatrist who said Bill's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction but said Bill would have to stop drinking. Martha said, "This is pointless." She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house and the downward spiral continued until his death on February 9, 1981.<ref>Falling Comet. Michael Hall. 2011. Texas Monthly, June 2011.</ref>

Haley's death certificate listed "Natural causes: Most likely heart attack" as the 'Immediate Cause' of death. The next lines, 'Due to, or as a consequence Of" were blank.<ref>Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. page 164. ISBN 0-8128-2909-3</ref>

Haley made a succession of bizarre, mostly monologue late-night phone calls to friends and relatives in which he seemed incoherently drunk or ill. Haley's first wife has been quoted as saying, "He would call and ramble and dwell on the past, his mind was really warped." A belligerent phone call to a business associate was taped and gives evidence of Haley's troubled state of mind.<ref>Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. pages 155-159. ISBN 0-8128-2909-3</ref>

Media reports immediately following his death indicated Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in his final weeks, although beyond a biography of Haley by John Swenson, released a year later, which described Haley painting the windows of his home black, there is little information extant about Haley's final days. 

Haley was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987. His son Pedro represented him at the ceremony.<ref name="Bruce Lee Smith">{{cite web|url=http://www.themonitor.com/articles/harlingen-22920-haley-pioneer.html|title=Pioneer Haley almost forgotten in Harlingen|author=Bruce Lee Smith|publisher=AIM Media Texas|date=6 February 2009}}</ref>  He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref>Dawson, Jim and Whitcomb, Ian (2005). ''Rock Around the Clock: The Record that Started the Rock Revolution!'', p. 180. Hal Leonard Corporation. ISBN 0-87930-829-X</ref>  The Comets were separately inducted into the Hall of Fame as a group in 2012, after a rule change allowed the induction of backing groups (the Comets were mass-inducted alongside several other groups such as [[Hank Ballard]]'s the Midnighters and [[Gene Vincent]]'s Blue Caps. 

Songwriters Tom Russell and [[Dave Alvin]] addressed Haley's demise in musical terms with "Haley's Comet" on Alvin's 1991 album ''Blue Blvd.'' [[Dwight Yoakam]] sang backup on the tribute.

Haley's original Comets still tour the world. They released a concert [[DVD]] in 2004 on Hydra Records, played the [[Viper Room]] in [[West Hollywood]] in 2005, and performed at Dick Clark's American Bandstand Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]] in 2006-07.

In March 2007, the Original Comets pre-opened the Bill Haley Museum in [[Munich, Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockithydra.de |title=Rockithydra |language={{de icon}} |publisher=Rockithydra.de |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> On October 27, 2007, ex-Comets guitar player Bill Turner opened the Bill Haley Museum for the public.

==Biographies==
* In 1980, Haley began working on an autobiography entitled ''The Life and Times of Bill Haley'' but died after completing only 100 pages. The work is registered with the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] but has yet to be released to the public.
* In 1982, John Swenson wrote ''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll'' (published in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] under the title, ''Bill Haley'').
* In 1990, Haley's eldest son, John W. Haley, along with John von Hoëlle wrote ''Sound and Glory'', a biography focusing mostly on Haley's early life and peak career years. This book is out of print.
* A [[German language|German]] language biography was published soon after Haley's death, written by Peter Cornelsen and Harald D. Kain.
* A book on the history of Haley's most famous recording, ''Rock Around the Clock: The Record That Started the Rock Revolution'' by [[Jim Dawson]] was published in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra.html#clockbook |title="EXTRA!"

==Film portrayals==
Unlike his contemporaries, Bill Haley has rarely been portrayed on screen. Following the success of ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]'' in 1978, Haley expressed interest in having his life story committed to film, but this never came to fruition. In the 1980s and early 1990s, numerous media reports emerged that plans were underway to do a biopic based upon Haley's life, with [[Beau Bridges]], [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[John Ritter]] all at one point being mentioned as actors in line to play Haley (according to ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine Magazine]]'', Ritter attempted to buy the film rights to ''Sound and Glory''). 

Bill Haley has also been portrayed - not always in a positive light - in several "period" films:
* John Paramor in ''[[Shout! The Story of Johnny O'Keefe]]'' (1985)
* Michael Daingerfield in ''Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story'' (1999)
* [[Dicky Barrett]] (of [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]) in ''[[Shake, Rattle and Roll: An American Love Story]]'' (also 1999)

In March 2005, the [[United Kingdom|British]] network [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky TV]] reported that [[Tom Hanks]] was planning to produce a biopic on the life of Bill Haley, with production tentatively scheduled to begin in 2006.<ref>[http://www.sky.com/showbiz/picture_gallery/0,,50004-1175946-2,00.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> However this rumor was quickly debunked by Hanks.

==Discography==

Before the formation of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen, which later became the Comets, Haley released several singles with other groups. Dates are approximate due to lack of documentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billhaleycentral.com |title=Bill Haley Database |publisher=Billhaleycentral.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

As '''Bill Haley and the Four Aces of Western Swing''':

1948
* ''Too Many Parties and Too Many Pals'' (vocal by Tex King)/''Four Leaf Clover Blues'' ([[Cowboy Records|Cowboy]] CR1201)
1949
* ''Tennessee Border/Candy Kisses'' (Cowboy CR1202)

As '''Johnny Clifton and His String Band''':

1950
* ''Stand Up and Be Counted/Loveless Blues'' ([[Center Records|Center]] C102)

Many Haley discographies list two 1946 recordings by the [[Down Homers]] released on the [[Vogue Records]] label as featuring Haley. Haley historian Chris Gardner, as well as surviving members of the group, have confirmed that the two singles: "Out Where the West Winds Blow"/"Who's Gonna Kiss You When I'm Gone" (Vogue R736) and "Boogie Woogie Yodel"/"Baby I Found Out All About You" (Vogue R786) do not feature Haley.<ref>[http://thegardnerfamily.org/haley/discography/recordings.html Thegardnerfamily.org]</ref> However, the tracks were nonetheless included in the compilation box set ''Rock 'n' Roll Arrives'' released by [[Bear Family Records]] in 2006.

:''See the discography section of [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] for a list of the singles and album releases made by Haley with the Saddlemen and the Comets from 1950 onwards.''

===Unreleased recordings===
Bill Haley recorded prolifically during the 1940s, often at the radio stations where he worked, or in formal studio settings. Virtually none of these recordings were ever released. Liner notes for a 2003 CD release by [[Hydra Records]] entitled ''Bill Haley and Friends Vol. 2: The Legendary Cowboy Recordings'' reveal that several additional Cowboy label single releases were planned for the Four Aces, but this never occurred. 

A number of previously unreleased Haley country-western recordings from the 1946-1950 period began to emerge near the end of Haley's life, some of which were released by the [[Arzee Records|Arzee]] label, with titles such as "Yodel Your Blues Away" and "Rose of My Heart." Still more demos, alternate takes, and wholly unheard-before recordings have been released since Haley's death. Notable examples of such releases include the albums ''Golden Country Origins'' by [[Grassroots Records]] of [[Australia]] and ''Hillbilly Haley'' by the British label, [[Rollercoaster Records|Rollercoaster]], as well as the aforementioned German release by Hydra Records. In 2006, [[Bear Family Records]] of Germany released what is considered to be the most comprehensive (yet still incomplete) collection of Haley's 1946-1950 recordings as part of its Haley box set ''Rock n' Roll Arrives''.

==Compositions==

Bill Haley's compositions included "Four Leaf Clover Blues", "[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]", "What'Cha Gonna Do", "Fractured", "Live It Up", "Farewell, So Long, Goodbye", "Real Rock Drive", "Rocking Chair on the Moon", "Sundown Boogie", "[[Birth Of The Boogie]]", "Two Hound Dogs", "[[Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie]]", "Hot Dog Buddy Buddy", "R-O-C-K", "[[Rudy's Rock]]", "Calling All Comets", "Tonight's the Night", "Hook, Line and Sinker", "Sway with Me", "Paper Boy (On Main Street U.S.A.)", "[[Skinny Minnie]]", "B.B. Betty", "Eloise", "Whoa Mabel!", "Vive la Rock and Roll", "So Right Toight", "Ana Maria", "Yucatan Twist", "Football Rock and Roll", and "Chick Safari". He also wrote or co-wrote songs for other artists such as "Calypso Rock" for Dave Day and The Red Coats on Kapp in 1956, "A.B.C. Rock" and "Rocky the Rockin' Rabbit" for [[Sally Starr (TV hostess)|Sally Starr]] on Arcade, and "(Ya Gotta) Sing For the Ladies" and "Butterfly Love" for Ginger Shannon and Johnny Montana in 1960 on Arcade as well as the unissued "I'm Shook" in 1958.
