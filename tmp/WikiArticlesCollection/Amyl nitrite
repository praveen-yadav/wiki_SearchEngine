'''Amyl nitrite''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>ONO. A variety of isomers are known, but they all feature an [[amyl]] group attached to the nitrito [[functional group]].  The alkyl group is unreactive and the chemical and biological properties are mainly due to the nitrite group.  Like other [[alkyl nitrite]]s, amyl nitrite is bioactive in mammals, being a [[vasodilator]], which is the basis of its use as a prescription medicine.  As an inhalant, it also has a [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] effect, which has led to its recreational use.

==Nomenclature==
The term "amyl nitrite" encompasses several [[isomers]].  For example, a common form of amyl nitrite with the formula (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>ONO may be more specifically referred to as isoamyl nitrite.   When the amyl group is a [[Alkane#Linear_alkanes|linear or normal (n)]] [[alkyl]] group, the resulting amyl nitrite would have the structural formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>ONO.

Despite a very similar name to amyl nitrite, [[amyl nitrate]] has a different chemical composition and different properties.

==Synthesis and reactions==
Alkyl nitrites are prepared by the reaction of [[alcohol]]s with [[nitrous acid]]:<ref>{{OrgSynth |author=[[William A. Noyes|Noyes, W. A.]] |year=1943 |title=n-Butyl Nitrite |volume= |pages= |collvol=2 |collvolpages=108 |prep=CV2P0108}}</ref>

:C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>OH  +  HONO  →  C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>ONO  +  H<sub>2</sub>O
The reaction is called [[esterification]]. Synthesis of alkyl nitrites is, in general, straightforward and can be accomplished in home laboratories. A common procedure includes the dropwise addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to a cooled mixture of an aqueous sodium nitrite solution and an alcohol. The intermediately-formed stoichiometric mixture of nitrous and nitric oxide then converts the alcohol to the alkyl nitrite, which, due to its low density, will form an upper layer that can be easily [[Decantation|decanted]] from the reaction mixture.

Isoamyl nitrite decomposes in the presence of base to give nitrite salts and the [[Amyl alcohol|isoamyl alcohol]]:
:C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>ONO  +  NaOH  → C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>OH  +  [[sodium nitrite|NaNO<sub>2</sub>]]

Amyl nitrite, like other alkyl nitrites, reacts with [[carbanion]]s to give [[oxime]]s.<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Chen, Y. K.; Jeon, S.-J; Walsh, P. J.; Nugent, W. A. | title = (2S)-(-)-3-exo-(Morpholino)isoborneol ((-)-MIB) | volume = 82 | pages = 87 | year = 2005 | prep = v82p0087}}</ref>

Amyl nitrites are also useful as reagents in a modification of the [[Sandmeyer reaction]].  The reaction of the alkyl nitrite with an aromatic [[amine]] in a halogenated solvent produces a [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] aromatic species, this then abstracts a [[halogen]] atom from the solvent.  For the synthesis of [[Organoiodine compound|aryl iodide]]s [[diiodomethane]] is used,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = William B. | last2 = Ho | first2 = Oliver Chenpu | title = Application of the isoamyl nitrite-diiodomethane route to aryl iodides | journal = The Journal of Organic Chemistry | volume = 55 | pages = 2543 | year = 1990 | doi = 10.1021/jo00295a056 | issue = 8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cornforth | first1 = John | last2 = Kumar | first2 = Ashok | last3 = Stuart | first3 = Alan S. | title = Synthesis of substituted dibenzophospholes.

==Physiological effects==
Amyl nitrite, in common with other [[alkyl nitrites]],<ref>Nickerson, Mark, John O Parker, Thomas P Lowry, and Edward W Swenson. ''[http://www.virusmythpoppersmyth.org/isobutyl_nitrite_and_rela/files/IBNtextnpttypepad.pdf Isobutyl Nitrite and Related Compounds]'', 1st ed. San Francisco: Pharmex, Ltd, 1979.</ref> is a potent [[vasodilator]] (''i.e.,'' it expands [[blood vessel]]s, resulting in lowering of the [[blood pressure]]).   Alkyl nitrites function as a source of [[nitric oxide]], which signals for relaxation of the [[involuntary muscle]]s.  Physical effects include decrease in blood pressure, headache, flushing of the face, increased heart rate, dizziness, and relaxation of involuntary muscles, especially the [[blood vessel]] walls and the [[anal sphincter]].  There are no [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms.  [[Overdose]] symptoms include [[nausea]], [[emesis]] (vomiting), [[hypotension]], [[hypoventilation]], [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), and [[fainting|syncope]] (fainting). The effects set in very quickly, typically within a few seconds and disappear soon after (within minutes).

==Applications==
Amyl nitrite is employed medically to treat [[ischaemic heart disease|heart disease]]s such as [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and also to treat [[cyanide poisoning]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = The Effects of Nitroglycerin and Amyl Nitrite on Arteriolar and Venous Tone in the Human Forearm| author = Cheng, L.; Goodwin, C. A.; Schully, M. F.; Kakkar, V. V.; Claeson, G.| journal = [[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]]| year = 1965| volume = 3| issue = 2| pages = 755–66 | pmid = 4954412 }}</ref><ref>AJ Giannini, AE Slaby, MC Giannini. ''The Handbook of Overdose and Detoxification Emergencies''. New Hyde Park, NY. Medical Examination Publishing Co., 1982, pp.48-50.</ref>    It is also used as an [[inhalant]] drug that induces a brief euphoric state, and when combined with other intoxicant stimulant drugs such as [[cocaine]] or ecstasy (see [[MDMA]]), the euphoric state intensifies and is prolonged. Once some stimulative drugs wear off, a common side effect is a period of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]], colloquially called a "come down"; amyl nitrite is sometimes used to combat these negative after-effects.  This effect, combined with its dissociative effects, has led to its use as a recreational drug (see  [[poppers]]).<ref>AJ Giannini, AE Slaby, MC Giannini. ''The Handbook of Overdose and Detoxification Emergencies''. New Hyde Park, NY. Medical Examination Publishing Co., 1982, pp.48-50.</ref>

Amyl nitrite is also sometimes used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning. It can act as an [[oxidant]], to induce the formation of [[methemoglobin]]. Methemoglobin in turn can sequester [[cyanide]] as [[cyanomethemoglobin]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = Cyanide Antidotes: from Amyl Nitrite to Hydroxocobalamin - Which Antidote is Best?| author = Vale, J. A.| journal = [[Toxicology (journal)|Toxicology]]| year = 2001| volume = 168| issue = 1| pages = 37–38}}</ref>
