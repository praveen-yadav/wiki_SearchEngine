First documented in the 13th century, Berlin became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (1701–1918), the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918), the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33) and the [[Third Reich]] (1933–45).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/germanunification.html|title=Documents of German Unification, 1848–1871|work=Modern History Sourcebook|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref> [[1920s Berlin|Berlin in the 1920s]] was the third largest municipality in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=23505|title=Topographies of Class: Modern Architecture and Mass Society in Weimar Berlin (Social History, Popular Culture, and Politics in Germany).|work=www.h-net.org|accessdate=9 October 2009}}</ref> After [[World War II]], the city, along with the German state, was divided - into [[East Berlin]] — capital of the [[German Democratic Republic]], colloquially identified in English as East Germany — and [[West Berlin]], a political [[exclave]] (surrounded by the [[Berlin Wall]] from 1961 to 1989)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/62202/Berlin-Wall|title=Berlin Wall|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref> and a ''de facto'' (although [[Allied Control Council|not ''de jure'']]) state of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], known colloquially in English as [[West Germany]] from 1949 to 1990.

==Etymology==

The origin of the name ''Berlin'' is uncertain, but it may have its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' ("swamp").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=3-411-06252-5}}</ref> [[Folk etymology]] connects the name to the German word for bear, ''Bär''. (A bear also appears in the [[Coat of arms of Berlin|coat of arms of the city]].)

In 1307 they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.<ref name="Stöver2010">Stöver B. Geschichte Berlins. Verlag CH Beck, 2010.

In 1415, [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] became the [[prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which he ruled until 1440.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html|title=The Hohenzollern Dynasty|work=Antipas|accessdate=18 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093738/http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html |archivedate=7 August 2007}}</ref> During the 15th century his successors would establish Berlin-Cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the [[Hohenzollern]] family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as [[German emperor]]s. In 1443 [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]] started the construction of a new [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|royal palace]] in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" ("Berliner Unwille").<ref>[http://www.diegeschichteberlins.de/geschichteberlins/berlinabc/stichworteag/555-berliner-unwillen.html Berliner Unwillen].

After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. From 1470, with the new elector [[Albrecht III Achilles, Elector of Brandenburg|Albrecht III Achilles]], Berlin-Cölln became the new royal residence.<ref name="Lui stadtgr"/> Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when [[John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg|John Cicero]] came to power.<ref>{{cite web|title=The electors’ residence|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/residenzstadt.en.html|accessdate=11 June 2013|location=www.berlin.de}}</ref> Berlin-Cölln, however, had to give up its status as a free [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city.

===17th to 19th centuries===
[[File:Friedrich Zweite Alt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick the Great]] (1712–1786) was one of Europe's [[enlightened monarch]]s.]]

The [[Thirty Years' War]] between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/germany/bra30.html|title=Brandenburg during the 30 Years War|work=WHKMLA|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref> [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], known as the "Great Elector", who had succeeded his father [[George William, Elector of Brandenburg|George William]] as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance. With the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French [[Huguenot]]s. More than 15,000 Huguenots went to Brandenburg, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. By 1700, approximately 20 percent of Berlin's residents were French, and their cultural influence on the city was immense.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Many other immigrants came from [[Bohemia]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], and [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]].

[[File:Berlin Unter den Linden Victoria Hotel um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin became the capital of the German Empire in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years. (Unter den Linden in 1900)]]

Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in [[personal union]] with the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. In 1701, however, the dual state formed the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], as [[Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg]] now crowned himself as king [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I in Prussia]]. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom. This was a successful attempt to centralize the capital in the very outspread state, and it was the first time the city began to grow.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 1709 Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerfer, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, ”Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".<ref name="Stöver2010"/>

In 1740, Frederick II, known as [[Frederick the Great]] (1740–1786), came to power. Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of [[the Enlightenment]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Following [[First French Empire|France's]] victory in the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. In 1815, the city became part of the new [[Province of Brandenburg]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main rail hub and economic center of Germany.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Moabit]], and several others were incorporated into Berlin.

In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded [[German Empire]]. On 1 April 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.

===20th century===
[[File:Potsdamer Platz 1945.jpg|thumb|Berlin in ruins after [[World War II]] ([[Potsdamer Platz]], 1945).]]

At the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed in Berlin. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. This new area encompassed Spandau and [[Charlottenburg]] in the west, as well as several other areas that are now major municipalities. After this expansion, Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin became internationally renowned as a center of cultural transformation, at the heart of the [[Roaring Twenties]].

On 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Machtergreifung|came to power]]. Nazi rule effectively destroyed Berlin's Jewish community, which had numbered 160,000 in 1933, representing one-third of all Jews in the Germany. Berlin's Jewish population fell to about 80,000 as a result of emigration from Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1939. After [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] or, starting in early 1943, were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]].<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005450 Berlin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in [[Battle of Berlin (air)|the 1943–45 air raids]] and during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. Among the hundreds of thousands who died during the Battle of Berlin, an estimated 125,000 were civilians.<ref>{{citation|last=Clodfelter|first=Michael|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts- A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1500–2000|edition=2nd|publisher=McFarland & Company|year=2002|isbn=0-7864-1204-6}}</ref> After the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]] in 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the [[Western Allies]] (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t297c01.html|title=Agreement to divide Berlin|work=FDR-Library|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>

All four [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The [[Berlin airlift]], conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from 24 June 1948 to 11 May 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|work=Western Allies Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref> In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]] and eventually included all of the American, British, and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but as a ''[[City state|corpus separatum]]'' it politically was very closely aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite Berlin's geographic location within East Germany. West Berlin issued its own postage stamps, which were often the same as West German postage stamps but with the additional word "Berlin" added. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British, and French airlines.

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.]]

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed East Berlin (described as "Berlin") as its capital, a move that was not recognized by the western powers. Although only half the size and population of West Berlin, East Berlin included most of the historic center of the city. The West German government, meanwhile, established itself provisionally in [[Bonn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html|title=Berlin official website; History after 1945|work=City of Berlin|accessdate=8 April 2009}}</ref>

As a result of the political and economical tensions brought on by the Cold War, on 13 August 1961, East Germany began the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] between East and West Berlin and similar barriers around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] on 27 October 1961. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.

Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other (but only through strictly controlled checkpoints), for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm|title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971|work=US Berlin Embassy|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>

In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished, with little of its physical structure remaining today; the [[East Side Gallery]] in [[Friedrichshain]] near the ''Oberbaumbrücke'' over the [[Spree]] preserves a portion of the Wall.

On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became the official German capital. In June 1991, the German Parliament, the [[Bundestag]], voted the ''{{lang|de|[[Decision on the Capital of Germany|Hauptstadtbeschluss]]}}'' to move the seat of the (West) German capital back from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Berlin}}
[[File:Berlin.svg|thumb|Natural and built environment]]

Berlin is situated in northeastern [[Germany]], approximately {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the [[Poland|Polish]] border, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat [[topography]], part of the vast [[Northern European Plain]] which stretches all the way from northern [[France]] to western [[Russia]]. The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the Teltow Plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, Berlin's westernmost borough, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&spn=0.060339,0.085316&t=k&hl=en|title=Satellite Image Berlin|work=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Über den Dächern von Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|View over central Berlin. [[Unter den Linden]] in foreground and skyscrapers of [[Potsdamer Platz]] up to the right.]]

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the [[Teufelsberg]] and the [[Müggelberge]] in the city's outskirts, and in the center the [[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|Kreuzberg]]. While the latter measures {{convert|66|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the former both have an elevation of about {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Teufelsberg is in fact an artificial hill composed of a [[Schuttberg|pile of rubble]] from the ruins of World War II.

===Climate===
[[File:Luftbild bln-schmoeckwitz.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes]]
Berlin has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system.

Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of {{convert|22|-|25|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|12|-|14|C|F}}. Winters are relatively cold with average high temperatures of {{convert|3|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|-2|to|0|C|F}}. Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city's buildings. Temperatures can be {{convert|4|C-change|sigfig=1}} higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/ |title=weather.com |publisher=weather.com |date= |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>

Annual precipitation is {{convert|570|mm|in|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through March, but snow cover does not usually remain for long. The recent winter of 2009/2010 was an exception since there was a permanent snow cover from late December till early March.<ref name=worldweather>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweather.org/016/c00059.htm|title=Climate figures|work=World Weather Information Service|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>

===Cityscape===
[[File:Berlin night.jpg|thumb|Berlin along the Spree river and the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] by night]]

Berlin's history has left the city with a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin—the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany—initiated ambitious (re-) construction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture. Berlin was devastated by bombing raids during World War II, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished in the 1950s and 1960s in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads.

The eastern parts of Berlin have many ''[[Plattenbau]]ten'', reminders of [[Eastern Bloc]] ambitions to create complete residential areas that had fixed ratios of shops, kindergartens, and schools to the number of inhabitants.

===Architecture===
{{main|Architecture in Berlin}}
[[File:Berlin Tiergarten Siegessäule Luftansicht.jpg|thumb|right|View over [[Tiergarten]] with [[Berlin Victory Column]]]]

The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]] of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.

[[File:Brandenburger Tor Nachts.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Brandenburg Gate]].]]

The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division. It has recently undergone a restoration.

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany. It also appears on German euro coins (10&nbsp;cent, 20&nbsp;cent, and 50&nbsp;cent). The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament, renovated in the 1950s after severe World War II damage. The building was again remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

[[File:Potsdamer Platz with Site of Potsdamer Bahnhof 2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Potsdamer Platz]]]]

The [[Gendarmenmarkt]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin whose name dates back to the quarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century, is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

The [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and the construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as the reconstruction of the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]] on the same island<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/neumann--stadtschloss-wird-teurer,10917074,10924086.html |title=Neumann: Stadtschloss wird teurer|work= Berliner Zeitung  |language={{de icon}} |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> is costing over 2 billion [[Euro]]s since reunification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/die-nullerjahre--nation-building---der-wiedervereinigte-staat-baut-sich-eine-neue-hauptstadt-das-pathos-der-berliner-republik,10810590,10717494.html |title=Das Pathos der Berliner Republik|work= Berliner Zeitung |language={{de icon}} |date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> Also located on the island and adjacent to the [[Lustgarten]] and palace is [[Berlin Cathedral]], emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. The church is now owned by the Protestant umbrella [[Union Evangelischer Kirchen|Union of Evangelical Churches (UEK)]]. Like many other buildings, it suffered extensive damage during the Second World War and had to be restored. Berlin's best preserved medieval [[St. Mary's Church, Berlin|Church of St. Mary's]] is the 1<sup>st</sup> preaching venue&nbsp;– [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church|Memorial Church]] being the 2<sup>nd</sup> – of the Bishop of the [[Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia|Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO)]], a Protestant [[Landeskirche|regional church body]]. [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]] is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.

[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is located there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Roaring Twenties]]. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after 1995 after the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]] came down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html|title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990|work=Senate Department of Urban Development|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref> To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]]. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], a [[Holocaust]] memorial, is situated to the north.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html?ex=1162962000&en=272335914d8b80d6&ei=5070|title=A Forest of Pillars, Recalling the Unimaginable|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 August 2008|first=Nicolai|last=Ouroussoff|date=9 May 2005}}</ref>

The area around [[Hackescher Markt]] is home to the fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. [[Oranienburger Straße]] and the nearby [[New Synagogue (Berlin)|New Synagogue]] were the center of Jewish culture before 1933. Although the New Synagogue is still an anchor for Jewish history and culture, Oranienburger straße and surrounding areas are increasingly known for the shopping and nightlife.

[[File:Schloss Charlottenburg im Sommer.jpg|thumb|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] is the largest existing palace in Berlin.]]

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central East-West-Axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately half-way from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!" speech, is situated in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Schloss Bellevue]] is the residence of the German President. [[Schloss Charlottenburg]], which was burnt out in the Second World War and largely destroyed, has been rebuilt and is the largest surviving historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower at the fair area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

===Capital city===
Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. The [[President of Germany]], whose functions are mainly ceremonial under the [[Grundgesetz|German constitution]], has his official residence in [[Schloss Bellevue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/DE/Home/home_node.html |title=Bundespräsident Horst Köhler |language={{de icon}} |publisher=Bundespraesident.de |date= |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> Berlin is the seat of the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|German executive]], housed in the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]], the ''Bundeskanzleramt''.

Facing the Chancellery is the [[Bundestag]], the German Parliament, housed in the renovated [[Reichstag building]] since the government moved back to Berlin in 1998. The [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] ("federal council", performing the function of an upper house) is the representation of the Federal States (''Bundesländer'') of Germany and has its seat at the former [[Prussian House of Lords]]. Though most of the ministries are seated in Berlin, some of them, as well as some minor departments, are seated in [[Bonn]], the former capital of West Germany. [[Berlin-Bonn Act|Discussions to move]] the remaining branches continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/der-regierungsumzug-ist-ueberfaellig,10810590,10751012.html |title=Der Regierungsumzug ist überfällig|work= Berliner Zeitung|language={{de icon}}|date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>

===City state===
[[File:Boulevard der Stars 2012 Brigitte Mira.jpg|upright|thumb|upright|Mayor since 2001, [[Klaus Wowereit]]]]

The city and state parliament is the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]] (''Abgeordnetenhaus''), which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the [[Senate of Berlin]] (''Senat von Berlin''). The Senate of Berlin consists of the [[List of mayors of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] (''Regierender Bürgermeister'') and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the official title "Mayor" (''Bürgermeister'') as deputy to the Governing Mayor. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 state election]] and won another term in the [[Berlin state election, 2006|2006 state election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/produkte/Faltblatt_Brochure/berlin_in_Zahlen_engl.pdf|title=Berlin state election, 2006|work=Der Landeswahlleiter für Berlin|accessdate=17 August 2008|language=German}}</ref> After the [[Berlin state election, 2011|2011 state election]], there is a coalition of the Social Democratic Party with the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], and for the first time ever, the [[Piratenpartei Deutschland|Pirate Party]] won seats in a state parliament in Germany when its [[Pirate Party Berlin|Berlin chapter]] received 8.9% of the vote.

The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the city (''Oberbürgermeister der Stadt'') and Prime Minister of the Federal State (''Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes''). The office of Berlin's Governing Mayor is in the [[Rotes Rathaus|Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall)]].

Since [[German reunification|the reunification]] on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three [[States of Germany#Subdivisions|city states in Germany]], together with [[Hamburg]] and the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]], among the present 16 states of Germany.

===Boroughs===

[[File:Berlin Subdivisions.svg|thumb|right|Map of Berlin's twelve boroughs and their 96 localities.]]

Berlin is subdivided into twelve boroughs (''Bezirke''), down from 23 boroughs before [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]]. Each borough contains a number of localities (''Ortsteile''), which often have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920 and became urbanized and incorporated into the city. Many residents strongly identify with their localities or boroughs. At present Berlin consists of 96 localities, which are commonly made up of several city neighborhoods—called ''[[Kiez]]'' in the [[Berlin dialect]]—representing small residential areas.

Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') and a borough mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The borough council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities, however. <!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The power of borough governments is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), led by the city's governing mayor, which advises the senate.

The localities have no local government bodies, and the administrative duties of the former locality representative, the ''Ortsvorsteher'', were taken over by the borough mayors.

===Twin towns – Sister cities===
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}
Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.<ref name=Berlinsistercities>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/staedteverbindungen/staedtepartnerschaft_ueberblick.en.html|title=Berlin's international city relations|work=Berlin Mayor's Office|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>  [[Twin towns and sister cities|Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification and later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Beirut]], [[Belgrade]], [[São Paulo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], [[Oslo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], [[New York City]] and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, and Conference of the World's Capital Cities.

===Energy===
[[File:Berlin HKW Mitte.jpg|thumb|upright|Heizkraftwerk Mitte]]

Berlin's energy is mainly supplied by the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]], which relies more heavily than other electricity producers on [[lignite]] as an energy source. Because burning lignite produces harmful emissions, Vattenfall has announced its commitment to transitioning to cleaner sources, such as [[renewable energy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&dig=2006/05/30/a0166|title=Abgase tiefer gelegt|first=Nick|last=Reimer|work=[[Die Tageszeitung|taz]]|date=30 May 2006|accessdate=18 August 2008|language=German}}</ref> In the former West Berlin, electricity was supplied chiefly by thermal power stations. To facilitate buffering during load peaks, [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulators]] were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low energy consumption and unloaded during periods of high consumption.

In 1993 the power grid connections to the surrounding areas, which had been cut in 1951, were restored. In the western districts of Berlin, nearly all power lines are underground cables; only a 380&nbsp;kV and a 110&nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] was built when West Berlin's electrical grid was not connected to those of East or West Germany. This has now become the backbone of the city's energy grid.

The car maker [[Daimler AG]] and the electric utility RWE AG are going to begin a joint electric car and [[charging station]] test project in Berlin called "E-Mobility Berlin."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/ |work=CNN |title=CNN.com Video}}</ref>

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{convert|66|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|883|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and the population from 1.9&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million.
<br/>
Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to about 250,000 [[Turks in Germany|Turks]] (especially in [[Kreuzberg]], [[Neukölln]] and [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], a locality in the borough of [[Mitte]]),<ref name="250k Turks">{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/berlin-shish-and-sauerkraut-to-go-448678.html|title=Berlin: Shish And Sauerkraut To Go|first=Andrew|last=Spooner|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=13 May 2007|accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.

In the 1990s the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former [[Soviet Union]].

German international public broadcaster [[Deutsche Welle]] has its TV production unit in Berlin, and most national German broadcasters have a studio in the city including [[ZDF]] and [[RTL Television|RTL]]. American radio programming from [[National Public Radio]] is also broadcast on the FM dial.

Berlin has Germany's largest number of daily newspapers, with numerous local [[broadsheet]]s (''[[Berliner Morgenpost]]'', ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'', ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]''), and three major [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s, as well as national dailies of varying sizes, each with a different political affiliation, such as ''[[Die Welt]]'', ''[[Junge Welt]]'', ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'', and ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]''.

===Nightlife and festivals===
Berlin's nightlife is one of the most diverse and vibrant of its kind in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=6949|title=Losing your mind in Berlin|first=Walter|last=Wasacz|work=[[Metro Times]]|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=18 November 2006}}</ref> Throughout the 1990s, people in their twenties from many countries, particularly those in Eastern and Central Europe, made Berlin's club scene the premier nightlife destination of Europe. After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city center of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and [[counterculture]] gatherings. Mitte and surrounding boroughs are also home to many nightclubs, including [[techno]] clubs [[Tresor]], WMF, [[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo]], [[E-Werk]], [[KitKatClub]] and [[Berghain]]. The techno-music club, Linientreu, near the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]], has been in business since the late 1980s.

Berlin is notable for its diverse partyscene. Clubs are not required to close at a fixed time on the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning, or all weekend. Berghain features the Panorama Bar, so named because the bar opens its shades at daybreak, allowing party-goers a panorama view of Berlin after dancing through the night.

The SO36 in Kreuzberg originally focused largely on [[punk music]] but today has become a popular venue for many dances and parties. SOUND, located from 1971 to 1988 in Tiergarten and today in Charlottenburg, gained notoriety in the late 1970s for its popularity with heroin users and other drug addicts as described in [[Christiane F.]]'s book ''Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://christiane.hurz.at/ |title=Christiane F.-Page |publisher=Christiane.hurz.at |date= |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>

The Berlin State Opera on [[Unter den Linden]] opened in 1742 and is the oldest of the three. Its current musical director is [[Daniel Barenboim]].

During the division of the city from 1961 to 1989 it was the only major opera house in West Berlin. The city's main venue for musical theater performances is the [[Theater des Westens]] (built 1895).
