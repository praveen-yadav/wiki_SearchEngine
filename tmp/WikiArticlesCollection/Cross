[[File:Cross2.svg|thumb|150px|A ''Greek cross'' (all arms of equal length) above a ''[[saltire]]'', a cross whose limbs are slanted]]
A '''cross''' is a geometrical figure consisting of two lines or bars perpendicular to each other, dividing one or two of the lines in half. The lines usually run vertically and horizontally; if they run obliquely, the design is technically termed a [[saltire]], although the arms of a saltire need not meet at right angles.

The cross is one of the most ancient human symbols, and has been used by many religions, most notably [[Christian cross|Christianity]]. It is frequently a representation of the division of the world into [[classical element|four elements]] (Chevalier, 1997) or [[cardinal directions|cardinal points]], or alternately as the union of the concepts of [[divinity]], the vertical line, and the [[world]], the horizontal line (Koch, 1955).

== Etymology ==
The word ''[[:wikt:cross|cross]]'' comes ultimately from [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:crux|crux]]'', a Roman torture device used for [[crucifixion]], via [[Old Irish]] ''cros''. The word was introduced to English in the 10th century as the term for the instrument of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|torturous execution of Jesus]] as described in the [[New Testament]], gradually replacing the earlier word ''[[rood]]''.

== History ==
[[File:CROSS Sacral Stavros from the Temple Repositories of Knossos 1600 BCE Heraclion Museum Greece.JPG|thumb|upright|1600 BC marble sacral cross from the Temple Repositories of [[Knossos]].<br>([[Heraclion]] Archaeological Museum, [[Greece]])]]

It is not known when the first cross image was made; after circles, crosses are one of the first symbols drawn by children of all cultures. There are many cross-shaped [[Petroglyph|incisions]] in European cult caves, dating back to the earliest stages of human cultural development in the [[stone age]]. Like other symbols from this period, their use continued in the [[Celt]]ic and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] cultures in Europe. For example, Celtic coins minted many centuries before the Christian era may have an entire side showing this type of cross, sometimes with the cardinal points marked by concave depressions in the same style as in stone age carvings. Other coins may be showing the cross held by a rider on a horse and springing  a fern leaf, sometimes identified as a [[Tree of life|Tree of Life]] symbol.

As of April 10, 2013, pictures of a possible contender for the first use of the cross symbol has been found at the Tell Khaiber excavation site in Ur, Iraq.  The shape of one of the buildings, believed to be about 4,000 years old, is in the shape of a cross of the type used in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  A picture of the building's floor can be seen here:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://urheritage.tumblr.com/ |title=Ur Region Archaeology Project |publisher=Urheritage.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref>  This would predate the ancient Israelites Tabernacle in the wilderness and the first two temples by about 800 years.

Written crosses are used for many different purposes, particularly in mathematics.

* The [[addition]] (or ''plus'') sign (+) and the [[multiplication]] (or ''times'') sign (×) are cross shapes.
* A cross is often used as a [[check mark]] because it can be clearer, easier to create with an ordinary pen or pencil, and less obscuring of any text or image that is already present than a large dot. It also allows marking a position more accurately than a large dot.
* The [[Chinese character]] for ten is [[wikt:十|十]] (see [[Chinese numerals]]).
* The [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] or ''obelus'' (†) is a cross
* In the [[Georgian alphabet]], the letters [[wikt:ქ|ქ]] and [[wikt:ჯ|ჯ]] are crosses.
* In the [[Latin alphabet]], the letter [[X]] and the [[Lower case|minuscule]] form of [[t]] are crosses.
* The [[Roman numeral]] for [[10 (number)|ten]] is [[X]].
* A large cross through a text often means that it is wrong or should be considered deleted. A cross is also used stand-alone ([[✗]]) to denote rejection.

|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[File:Serbian Cross1.svg|140px]]
| | '''[[Serbian cross]]''' (Tetragrammatic cross)
|
The motif of a cross between objects is perhaps derived from [[Constantine I|Constantine's]] [[labarum]] and has figured on [[Byzantine]] coins, since the 6th century. Later, the four symbols of the cross have been interpreted as flints or firestones, but also as the initials (letters β) of the imperial motto of the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologos dynasty]]: King of Kings, Ruling Over Kings (Greek: βασιλεύς βασιλέων, βασιλεύων βασιλευόντων—Basileus Basileōn, Basileuōn Basileuontōn). The cross has been used by [[History of Serbia|Serbian]] states and the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] since the Middle Ages after [[Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Dušan the Mighty]] was crowned Emperor (Tsar) of the [[Serbs]] and [[Greeks]] (16 April 1345). Today it is the national, religious and ethnic symbol of [[Serbs]] and [[Serbia]].

| | '''Florian cross'''

Although similar to the [[Maltese Cross]] and [[Cross pattée]], it differs in having arms rounded outwards at the ends. Two different versions are included here; the one above is commonly found on fire service badges, patches, and emblems; the one below is typical of the Saint Florian medallion or medal.
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[File:OrthodoxCross(black,contoured).svg|100px]]
| | '''[[Orthodox cross]]'''
|
Used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The top line is said to represent the headboard, and the bottom, slanted line represents the footrest, wrenched loose by Jesus' writhing in intense agony. It is raised to the left side, because that was the side of the righteous criminal who said to Jesus: "remember me when you come into your kingdom". This symbolises the victory of good over evil.  The letters IC XC found at the end of the main arm of most Eastern Orthodox Crosses are a [[Christogram]], representing the name of Jesus Christ ({{lang-gr|Ιησούς Χριστός}}).  See also the [[Cross of Salem]].
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[File:St Brigid.png|120px]]
| | '''[[St. Brigid's Cross|Saint Brigid's Cross]]'''
|
This cross is found throughout Ireland. It is told that Brigid, daughter of a pagan king, made the cross from reeds to be used as an instrument of conversion. However, Brigid's name is derived from Brigit (also spelled Brigid, Brìghde, Brìde, and Bríde), a Celtic Goddess of fire, poetry, and smithcraft, and today the cross is used to protect houses from fire. This is an example of the integration of religious traditions.

Archaeological evidence of swastika-shaped ornaments dates from the [[Neolithic]] period. It occurs mainly in the modern day [[culture of India]], sometimes as a geometrical motif and sometimes as a religious symbol. It remains widely used in [[Eastern religions|Eastern]] and [[Dharmic religion]]s such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].
Though once commonly used all over much of the world without stigma, because of its right-facing variant's iconic usage in [[Nazi Germany]], the symbol has become stigmatized in the [[Western world]].

The symbol of the [[Crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which existed for almost two hundred years after the First Crusade; in the rendering at left, the large cross is shown slightly "potent", but that is not always the case. The four smaller crosses are said to symbolize either the four books of the Gospel or the four directions in which the Word of Christ spread from Jerusalem. Alternatively, all five crosses can symbolize the five wounds of Christ during the Passion. This symbol is used in the [[Flag of Georgia (country)|flag of Georgia]]. Also found in the coat of arms of the Papal Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, Vatican City (matriculated in Scotland as "Argent; a Jerusalem cross cantoned between four crosses couped, gules"—Scots Public Register, volume 75, page 112)—to be seen at various [http://www.eohsj.net/ EOHSJ websites]; also in the Canadian coat of Robert Gerald Guest ([http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=602&ShowAll=1 Canadian Public Register Volume III, page 85]).

== In flags ==
{{main|Glossary of vexillology}}
Several flags have crosses, including all the nations of [[Scandinavia]], whose crosses are known as [[Nordic Cross flag|Scandinavian crosses]], and many nations in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], which incorporate the [[Crux|Southern Cross]]. The [[Flag of Switzerland]] since the 17th century has displayed an equilateral cross in a square (the only [[Gallery of square flags|square flag]] of a sovereign state apart from the [[Flag of the Vatican City]]); the [[Red Cross]] emblem was based on the Swiss flag.
