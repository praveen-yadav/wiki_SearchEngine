The Semitic letter [[Daleth|Dâlet]] may have developed from the [[logogram]] for a fish or a door. There are various [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s that might have inspired this. In Semitic, Ancient Greek and Latin, the letter represented {{IPA|/d/}}; in the [[Etruscan alphabet]] the letter was superfluous but still retained (see letter [[B]]). The equivalent [[Greek letter]] is Delta, '[[Delta (letter)|Δ]]'.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

The [[Lower case|minuscule]] (lower-case) form of 'd' consists of a loop and a tall [[Vertical direction|vertical]] stroke.  It developed by gradual variations on the majuscule (capital) form. In handwriting, it was common to start the arc to the left of the vertical stroke, resulting in a [[serif]] at the top of the arc. This serif was extended while the rest of the letter was reduced, resulting in an angled stroke and loop. The angled stroke slowly developed into a vertical stroke.

In nearly all languages that use the Latin alphabet and the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] 'd' represents the [[voiced alveolar plosive|voiced alveolar]] or [[voiced dental plosive]] {{IPA|/d/}}, but in the [[Vietnamese alphabet]], it represents the sound {{IPA|/z/}} (or {{IPA|/j/}} in southern dialects). In [[Fijian language|Fijian]] it represents a [[prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]] stop {{IPA|/nd/}}.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Pacific languages: an introduction |first=John |last=Lynch |page=97 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zYfV1jN3whUC&pg=PA97&dq=d+fijian+prenasalized#v=onepage&q=d%20fijian%20prenasalized&f=false |year=1998 |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |isbn=0-8248-1898-9 }}</ref> In some languages where [[voice (phonetics)|voice]]less [[aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated]] stops contrast with voiceless aspirated stops, 'd' represents an unaspirated {{IPA|/t/}}, while 't' represents an aspirated {{IPA|/tʰ/}}. Examples of such languages include [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and the [[Pinyin]] transliteration of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].

The symbol "D" is used for [[500 (number)|500]] in [[Roman numerals]].
