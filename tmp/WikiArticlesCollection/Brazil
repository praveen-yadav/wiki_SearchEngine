The indigenous population of Brazil was divided into large indigenous nations composed of several ethnic groups among which stand out the large groups like [[Tupí people|Tupis]], [[Guaraní people|Guaranis]], [[Gê peoples|Gês]] and [[Arawak peoples|Arawaks]]. The former were subdivided into [[Tupiniquim people|Tupiniquins]] and [[Tupinambá]]s, among many subdivision of the others. The boundaries between these groups and their subgroups, before the arrival of Europeans, were marked by wars between them, arising from differences in culture, language and moral.<ref>Fausto, Carlos "Os Índios antes do Brasil" ("The Indians before Brazil") {{pt icon}} Jorge Zahar Ed. 2000 ISBN 857110543x pages 45-46, 55 (last paragraph)</ref> These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with ritual [[cannibalism]] on [[POWs]].<ref>Gomes, Mercio P.

When the Portuguese arrived in 1500 they saw the natives as noble savages, and [[miscegenation]] of the population began right away.<ref>Boxer, p.&nbsp;108</ref> Tribal warfare, cannibalism and the pursuit of Amazonian [[brazilwood]] for its treasured red dye convinced the Portuguese that they should civilize the indigenous population. But the Portuguese, like the Spanish in their South American possessions, had unknowingly brought diseases with them, against which many indigenous groups were helpless due to lack of immunity. [[Measles]], [[smallpox]], [[tuberculosis]], [[gonorrhea]], and [[influenza]] killed tens of thousands.<ref name="Boxer, p.&nbsp;102">Boxer, p.&nbsp;102.</ref> The diseases spread quickly along the indigenous trade routes, and whole tribes were likely annihilated without ever coming in direct contact with Europeans.<ref>Skidmore, pp.&nbsp;30, 32.</ref>

In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of [[continental Portugal]], causing [[John VI of Portugal|Prince Regent João]], in the name of Queen [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]], to move the royal court from [[Lisbon]] to [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Brazil]].<ref name="Boxer, p.&nbsp;213">Boxer, p.&nbsp;213</ref> There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local [[Stock Exchange|stock exchanges]],<ref>Marta Barcellos & Simone Azevedo; ''Histórias do Mercado de Capitais no Brasil'' ("Financial Markets' Histories in Brazil") (Portuguese) Campus Elsevier 2011 ISBN 85-352-3994-4 Introduction (by Ney Carvalho), Intro. page xiv</ref> a [[Banco do Brasil|National Bank]], and ended the monopoly of the colony trade with Portugal, opening it to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the [[Portuguese conquest of French Guiana]].<ref>Bueno, p.&nbsp;145.</ref>

With the end of the [[Peninsular War]] in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent João return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, in order to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for the past six years, the Crown established the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], thus creating a [[pluricontinental]] transatlantic monarchic state.<ref name="Mosher2008"/> The Portuguese leaders demanded return of the court to Lisbon, as the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]] required, and groups of Brazilians still demanded independence and a republic, as the [[Pernambucan Revolt|1817 Pernambucan Revolt]] showed.<ref name="Mosher2008">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey C.

During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery.

Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate [[Getúlio Vargas]] supported by most of the military, led a [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|successful revolt]].<ref>Levine; Robert M. & Crocitti; John J.

Biodiversity can contribute to [[agriculture]], livestock, forestry and fisheries extraction. However, almost all economically exploited species of plants, such as soybeans and coffee, or animals, such as chicken, are imported from other countries, and the economic use of native species still crawls. In the Brazilian GDP, the forest sector represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%.

The Brazilian Federation is the "indissoluble union" of the States, the Municipalities and the Federal District.<ref name="Constituição"/> The Union, the states and the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the "spheres of government." [[File:Aécio Neves na Convenção Nacional do PSDB em 2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright|250px|[[ Aecio Neves]] at the National Convention of the PSDB.]]The Federation is set on five fundamental principles:<ref name="Constituição"/> sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism. The classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative, and judicial under a checks and balances system), is formally established by the Constitution.<ref name="Constituição"/> The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state/Federal District spheres.

All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.<ref name=embassy>{{cite web |url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/brazil_in_brief/political_institution.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725100724/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/brazil_in_brief/political_institution.html |archivedate=25 July 2011 |title=Embassy of Brazil&nbsp;— Ottawa |date=|quote=Political Institutions&nbsp;— The Executive |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/government/brazil_government.html |title=City Mayors |date=|quote=Brazil federal, state and local government |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=JSTOR |date=|quote=Brazilian Politics |jstor=196424)}}</ref> Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams.<ref name=embassy/> For most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, proportional representation.

[[File:CongressoBR.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[National Congress of Brazil]], seat of the [[legislative branch]].]]

Together with several smaller parties, four political parties stand out: [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT), [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB), [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB), and [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] (DEM). Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southtravels.com/america/brazil/government.html |title=Government – Brazil |publisher=Southtravels.com |date=5 October 1988 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref> Almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the Executive.

The form of government is that of a democratic republic, with a presidential system.<ref name="Constituição"/> The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,<ref name="Constituição"/> with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term.

Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively.

===Law and Order===
{{Main|Law of Brazil|Law enforcement in Brazil|Crime in Brazil}}

Brazilian law is based on [[Roman law|Roman]]-[[Germania|Germanic]]{{failed verification|date=October 2013}} traditions<ref>[http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/bra/en_bra-int-des-ordrjur.html "The Brazilian Legal System"], Organization of American States. Retrieved 17 May 2007.</ref> and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases.

[[File:Supremo Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[Supreme Federal Court of Brazil]] serves primarily as the Constitutional Court of the country]]

The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, which was promulgated on 5 October 1988, and is the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.<ref>José Afonso da Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'' (Malheiros, 2004; ISBN 85-7420-559-1), p.&nbsp; 46.</ref> {{As of|2007|04}}, there have been 53 amendments.

This system has been criticised over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision making. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve, and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings.<ref>Miguel Glugoski and Odete Medauar, "[http://www.usp.br/jorusp/arquivo/2003/jusp667/pag0304.htm Nossos direitos nas suas mãos]," [[University of São Paulo|USP]] Journal, 24–30 November 2003.

Brazil is a federation composed of 26 [[Federated state|States]], one [[Federal district]] (which contains the capital city, [[Brasília]]) and [[Municipality|Municipalities]].<ref name="Constituição"/> States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can only be voted by the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.<ref name="Constituição"/>

The states and the federal district may be grouped into regions: [[Northern Region, Brazil|Northern]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern]]. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes, and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects.

Municipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Union and state government.<ref name="Constituição"/> Each has a mayor and an elected legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called ''[[comarca]]'' (county).

Tourism in Brazil is a growing sector and key to the economy of several regions of the country.

In terms of the 2011 [[Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report|Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index]] (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked 52nd in the world, 3rd among [[Latin American]] countries after [[Mexico]] and [[Costa Rica]], and 7th in the [[Americas]].<ref name=TTCI2011>{{cite web| url =http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TravelTourismCompetitiveness_Report_2011.pdf| author=Jennifer Blanke and Thea Chiesa, Editors |year = 2011 | title = Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2011 | publisher = [[World Economic Forum]], Geneva, Switzerland|accessdate=2011-03-14}}</ref> Brazil's competitive advantages are its natural resources, which ranked 1st on this criteria out of the 139 countries considered, and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources, due to its many [[World Heritage site]]s. The TTCI report notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 116th), with the quality of roads ranking in 105th place; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 114th), due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges, as well as high prices and high taxation.

According to the [[World Tourism Organization]] (WTO), international travel to Brazil accelerated in 2000, particularly during 2004 and 2005.
