'''Axayacatl''' ({{IPA-nah|aːʃaːˈjakat͡ɬ|}} (the name means "Water-mask" or "Water-face") was the sixth Aztec Emperor, a ruler (''[[tlatoani]]'') of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Aztec|Aztec Empire]] and city of [[Tenochtitlan]], who reigned from 1469 to 1481.

He is chiefly remembered for subjugating [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], Tenochtitlan's sister city, in 1473.

==Biography==
Axayacatl was a son of the princess [[Atotoztli II]] and her cousin, prince [[Tezozomoc (son of Itzcoatl)|Tezozomoc]]. He was a grandson of the Emperors [[Moctezuma I]] and [[Itzcoatl]]. He was a descendant of the king [[Cuauhtototzin]].

He was a successor of Moctezuma and his brothers were Emperors [[Tizoc]] and [[Ahuitzotl]] and his sister was the Queen [[Chalchiuhnenetzin]]. He was an uncle of the Emperor [[Cuauhtémoc]] and father of Emperors [[Moctezuma II]] and [[Cuitláhuac]].

Using as a pretext the insulting behavior of a few Tlatelolcan citizens, Axayacatl invaded his neighbor, killed its ruler, [[Moquihuix]], and replaced him with a military governor. The Tlatelolcans lost any voice they had in forming Aztec policy. It is also important that the [[Aztec calendar stone|Great Sun Stone]], also known as the Aztec Calendar, was carved under his leadership.

He was followed on the throne by his brother Tizoc in 1481.
