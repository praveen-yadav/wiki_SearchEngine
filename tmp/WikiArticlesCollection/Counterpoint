In [[music]], '''counterpoint''' is the relationship between [[Part (music)|voices]] that are [[harmony|harmonically]] interdependent ([[polyphony]]), but independent in [[rhythm]] and [[Pitch contour|contour]]. It has been most commonly identified in [[classical music]], developing strongly during the [[renaissance music|Renaissance]] and in much of the [[common practice period]], especially in [[Baroque music]]. The term originates from the [[Latin]] ''punctus contra punctum'' meaning "point against point".

==General principles==
In its most general aspect, counterpoint involves the writing of musical lines that sound very different and move independently from each other but sound harmonious when played simultaneously. In each era, [[Contrapuntal motion|contrapuntally]] organized music writing has been subject to rules, sometimes strict. By definition, [[Chord (music)|chords]] occur when multiple notes sound simultaneously; however, harmonic, "[[Interval (music)#Melodic and harmonic|vertical]]" features are considered secondary and almost incidental when counterpoint is the predominant textural element. Counterpoint focuses on melodic interaction&mdash;only secondarily on the harmonies produced by that interaction. In the words of John Rahn:

{{quote|It is hard to write a beautiful song. It is harder to write several individually beautiful songs that, when sung simultaneously, sound as a more beautiful polyphonic whole. The internal structures that create each of the voices separately must contribute to the emergent structure of the polyphony, which in turn must reinforce and comment on the structures of the individual voices. The way that is accomplished in detail is...'counterpoint'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rahn |first=John |others=intro. and comment. by [[Benjamin Boretz]] |title=Music Inside Out: Going Too Far in Musical Essays |year=2000 |publisher=G+B Arts International |location=Amsterdam |isbn=90-5701-332-0 |oclc=154331400 |ref=Rahn |page=177}}</ref>}}

In the modern period, polytonality and atonality were introduced. [[Glenn Gould]]'s String Quartet in F minor, Opus 1, for example, is "an idiosyncratic synthesis of idioms including Baroque fugue, Classical sonata form, Strauss's late-Romantic harmony, and Schoenberg's 'developing variation'".<ref>http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/glenn-gould, "Glenn Gould the Composer and Conductor"</ref>

==Development==
Some examples of related compositional genres include: the [[round (music)|round]] (familiar in folk traditions), the [[Canon (music)|canon]], and perhaps the most complex contrapuntal convention: the [[fugue]].

== Species counterpoint ==

Species counterpoint generally offers less freedom to the composer than other types of counterpoint, and is therefore a so-called ''strict'' counterpoint. Species counterpoint was developed as a pedagogical tool, in which a student progresses through several "species" of increasing complexity, with a very simple part that does not change known as the [[cantus firmus]] (Latin for "fixed melody"). The student gradually attains the ability to write ''free'' counterpoint (that is, less rigorously constrained counterpoint, usually without a cantus firmus) according to the rules at the given time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jeppesen |first=Knud |authorlink=Knud Jeppesen |others=trans. by [[Glen Haydon]], with a new foreword by Alfred Mann |title=Counterpoint: the polyphonic vocal style of the sixteenth century |origyear=1939 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OcSVGkug58gC |year=1992 |publisher=Dover |location=New York |isbn=0-486-27036-X }}</ref>  The idea is at least as old as 1532, when Giovanni Maria Lanfranco described a similar concept in his ''Scintille di musica'' (Brescia, 1533).  The 16th century [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian]] theorist [[Gioseffe Zarlino|Zarlino]] elaborated on the idea in his influential ''Le institutioni harmoniche'', and it was first presented in a codified form in 1619 by [[Lodovico Zacconi]] in his ''Prattica di musica''.  Zacconi, unlike later theorists, included a few extra contrapuntal techniques as species, for example [[Inversion (music)|invertible counterpoint]].

In 1725 [[Johann Joseph Fux]] published ''Gradus ad Parnassum'' (''[[Steps to Parnassus]]''), in which he described five species:

#Note against note;
#Two notes against one;
#Four (extended by others to include three, or six, etc.) notes against one;
#Notes offset against each other (as [[Nonchord tone|suspensions]]);
#All the first four species together, as "florid" counterpoint.

A succession of later theorists imitated Fux's seminal work quite closely, but often with some small and idiosyncratic modifications in the rules. A good example is [[Luigi Cherubini]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cherubini |first=Luigi |authorlink=Luigi Cherubini |others=with [[Fromental Halévy]] | title=Cours de contrepoint et de fugue |year=1835 |publisher=M. Schlesinger |location=Paris |oclc=11909698}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2013}}<!--Cherubini's book may not be used as evidence of its excellence, nor of its relationship to Fux.-->

===Considerations for all species===
The following rules apply to melodic writing in each species, for each part:

#The final must be approached by [[Steps and skips|step]].  If the final is approached from below, the [[leading tone]] must be raised in a minor key (Dorian), except in the case of the Phrygian mode.  Thus, in the Dorian mode on D, a C{{music|sharp}} is necessary at the [[cadence (music)|cadence]].<ref>"Counterpoint in Composition"</ref> 
#Permitted melodic intervals are the perfect fourth, fifth, and octave, as well as the major and minor second, major and minor third, and ascending minor sixth.  When the ascending minor sixth is used it must be immediately followed by motion downwards.
#If writing two [[Steps and skips|skips]] in the same direction—something that must be done only rarely—the second must be smaller than the first, and the interval between the first and the third note may not be dissonant.
#If writing a skip in one direction, it is best to proceed after the skip with motion in the other direction.
#The interval of a [[tritone]] in three notes should be avoided (for example, an ascending melodic motion F - A - B natural), as is the interval of a seventh in three notes.
#There must be a climax or high point in the line countering the [[Cantus firmus]]. This usually occurs somewhere in the middle of exercise and must occur on a strong beat.
#An outlining of a seventh is avoided within a single line moving in the same direction.

And, in all species, the following rules apply  concerning the combination of the parts:

#The counterpoint must begin and end on a perfect [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]].
#[[Contrary motion]] should predominate.
#Perfect consonances must be approached by oblique or contrary motion.
#Imperfect consonances may be approached by any type of motion.
#The interval of a tenth should not be exceeded between two adjacent parts, unless by necessity.
#Build from the bass, upward.

===First species===
In ''first species'' counterpoint, each note in every added part (parts being also referred to as ''lines'' or ''voices'') sounds against one note in the cantus firmus.  Notes in all parts are sounded simultaneously, and move against each other simultaneously.

In the present context, a "step" is a melodic interval of a half or whole step.  A "skip" is an interval of a third or fourth.  (See [[Steps and skips]].) An interval of a fifth or larger is referred to as a "leap".

A few further rules given by Fux, by study of the Palestrina style, and usually given in the works of later counterpoint pedagogues,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}<!--Who says that most later counterpoint teachers give these rules?--> are as follows.

#Begin and end on either the unison, octave, or fifth, unless the added part is underneath, in which case begin and end only on unison or octave.
#Use no unisons except at the beginning or end.
#Avoid [[Consecutive fifths|parallel fifths or octaves]] between any two parts; and avoid [[Consecutive fifths#Hidden consecutives|"hidden" parallel fifths or octaves]]: that is, movement by [[Contrary motion|similar motion]] to a perfect fifth or octave, unless one part (sometimes restricted to the ''higher'' of the parts) moves by step.
#Avoid moving in parallel fourths. (In practice Palestrina and others frequently allowed themselves such progressions, especially if they do not involve the lowest of the parts.)
#Avoid moving in parallel thirds or sixths for very long.
#Attempt to keep any two adjacent parts within a tenth of each other, unless an exceptionally pleasing line can be written by moving outside of that range.
#Avoid having any two parts move in the same direction by skip.
#Attempt to have as much contrary motion as possible.
#Avoid dissonant intervals between any two parts: major or minor 2nd, major or minor 7th, any augmented or diminished interval, and perfect fourth (in many contexts).

In the following example in two parts, the [[cantus firmus]] is the lower part. (The same cantus firmus is used for later examples also. Each is in the [[Dorian mode]].)
[[Image:species1.png|center|400px|thumb|Short example of "First Species" counterpoint ({{Audio|Species1.mid|play MIDI}})]]

===Second species===
In ''second species'' counterpoint, two notes in each of the added parts work against each longer note in the given part.

Additional considerations in second species counterpoint are as follows, and are in addition to the considerations for first species:
#It is permissible to begin on an upbeat, leaving a half-rest in the added voice.
#The accented beat must have only consonance (perfect or imperfect).  The unaccented beat may have dissonance, but only as a passing tone, i.e. it must be approached and left by step in the same direction.
#Avoid the interval of the unison except at the beginning or end of the example, except that it may occur on the unaccented portion of the bar.
#Use caution with successive accented perfect fifths or octaves.  They must not be used as part of a sequential pattern.
[[Image:species2.png|center|400px|thumb|Short example of "Second Species" counterpoint ({{Audio|Species2.mid|play MIDI}})]]

===Third species===
In ''third species'' counterpoint, four (or three, etc.) notes move against each longer note in the given part.
[[Image:species3.png|center|400px|thumb|Short example of "Third Species" counterpoint ({{Audio|Species3.mid|play MIDI}})]]

Three special figures are introduced into 3rd species and later added to fifth species, and ultimately outside of the restrictions of ''species writing.'' There are three figures to consider: The ''nota [[cambiata]],'' ''double neighbor tones,'' and ''double passing tones.'' 
Double Neighbor Tones: The figure is prolonged over four beats and allows special dissonances. The upper and lower tones are prepared on beat 1 and resolved on beat 4. The 5th note or downbeat of the next measure should move by step in the same direction as the last two notes of the double neighbor figure. Lastly a double passing tone allows two dissonant passing tones in a row. The figure would consist of 4 notes moving in the same direction by step. The two notes that allow dissonance would be beat 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. The dissonant interval of a 4th would proceed into a diminished 5th and the next note would resolve at the interval of a 6th.<ref>{{cite book|last=Salzer/Schacter|title=Counterpoint in Composition:The Study of Voice Leading|publisher=Stanley Persky, City University of New York|isbn=023107039X}}</ref>
[[File:Ascending Double Passing Tone.jpg|thumb|This is an example of a double passing tone in which the two middle notes are a dissonant interval from the cantus firmus. A 4th and a diminished 5th.]]
[[File:Descending Double Neighbor Figure.jpg|thumb|This is an example of a descending double neighbor figure against a cantus firmus.]]
[[File:Ascending Double Neighbor Figure.jpg|thumb|This is an example of an ascending double neighbor figure against a cantus firmus.]]

===Fourth species===
In ''fourth species'' counterpoint, some notes are sustained or ''suspended'' in an added part while notes move against them in the given part, often creating a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] on the beat, followed by the suspended note then changing (and "catching up") to create a subsequent [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] with the note in the given part as it continues to sound. As before, fourth species counterpoint is called ''expanded'' when the added-part notes vary in length among themselves. The technique requires chains of notes sustained across the boundaries determined by beat, and so creates [[syncopation]]. Also it is important to note that a dissonant interval is allowed on beat 1 because of the syncopation created by the suspension.

===Fifth species (florid counterpoint)===
In ''fifth species'' counterpoint, sometimes called ''florid counterpoint'', the other four species of counterpoint are combined within the added parts. In the example, the first and second bars are second species, the third bar is third species, the fourth and fifth bars are third and embellished fourth species, and the final bar is first species.

==Contrapuntal derivations==
Since the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period in European music, much contrapuntal music has been written in imitative counterpoint.  In imitative counterpoint, two or more voices enter at different times, and (especially when entering) each voice repeats some version of the same melodic element.  The ''[[fantasia (music)|fantasia]]'', the ''[[ricercar]]'', and later, the [[Canon (music)|canon]] and [[fugue]] (the contrapuntal form ''par excellence'') all feature imitative counterpoint, which also frequently appears in [[choir|choral]] works such as [[motet]]s and [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]].  Imitative counterpoint spawned a number of devices that composers use to give their works both [[mathematical rigor]] and expressive range.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  These devices include:

;[[Inversion (music)#Inverted melodies|Melodic inversion]]: The inverse of a given fragment of melody is the fragment turned upside down—so if the original fragment has a rising major third (see [[interval (music)|interval]]), the inverted fragment has a falling major (or perhaps minor) third, etc. (Compare, in [[twelve tone technique]], the inversion of the tone row, which is the so-called prime series turned upside down.) (Note: in ''invertible counterpoint'', including ''double'' and ''triple counterpoint'', the term ''inversion'' is used in a different sense altogether. At least one pair of parts is switched, so that the one that was higher becomes lower. See [[Inversion (music)#Counterpoint|Inversion in counterpoint]]; it is not a kind of imitation, but a rearrangement of the parts.)
;[[Retrograde (music)|Retrograde]]: Whereby an imitative voice sounds the melody backwards in relation the leading voice.
;[[Retrograde inversion]]: Where the imitative voice sounds the melody backwards and upside-down at once.
;[[Augmentation (music)|Augmentation]]: When in one of the parts in imitative counterpoint the note values are extended in duration compared to the rate at which they were sounded when introduced.
;[[Diminution]]: When in one of the parts in imitative counterpoint the note values are reduced in duration compared to the rate at which they were sounded when introduced.

==Free counterpoint==
From a historical perspective, Strict Counterpoint was chiefly practiced during Renaissance. 
Broadly speaking, due to the development of Harmony, from Baroque period on, most contrapuntal compositions were written in the spirit of Free Counterpoint.

Nonetheless, according to Kent Kennan: "....actual teaching in that fashion (free counterpoint) did not become widespread until the late nineteenth century." (Kent Kennan - Counterpoint p.&nbsp;4)

Main features of Free Counterpoint:
# All forbidden chords, such as 2nd-inversion, seventh, ninth etc., can be   used freely in principle of Harmony
# Chromatism is allowed
# The restrictions about rhythmic-placement of dissonance are removed. It is possible to use passing tones on the accented beat
# Appoggiatura is available: dissonance tones can be approached by leaps.

==Linear counterpoint==
[[Image:Linear counterpoint from Stravinsky's Octet.png|thumb|350px|right|Linear counterpoint from Stravinsky's Octet<ref name="Katz"/> {{audio|Linear counterpoint from Stravinsky's Octet.mid|Play}}. Note the C major [[ostinato]] and frequent dissonances and accidentals, including [[tritone|F{{music|#}}]].]]

'''Linear counterpoint''' is "a purely horizontal technique in which the integrity of the individual melodic lines is not sacrificed to harmonic considerations. The voice parts move freely, irrespective of the effects their combined motions may create."<ref name="Katz">Katz, Adele (1946). ''Challenge to Musical Tradition: A New Concept of Tonality'' (New York: A.A. Knopf), p.340. Reprinted New York: Da Capo Press, 1972; reprinted n.p.: Katz Press, 2007, ISBN 1-4067-5761-6.</ref> In other words, either "the domination of the horizontal (linear) aspects over the vertical"<ref name="Ulrich">Ulrich, Homer (1962). ''Music: a Design for Listening'', second edition (New York: Harcourt, Brace & World), p.438.</ref> is featured or the "harmonic control of lines is rejected."<ref name="Cunningham"/>

Associated with [[neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]],<ref name="Ulrich"/> the first work to use the technique is [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's]] [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet]] (1923),<ref name="Katz"/> inspired by [[J.S. Bach|Bach]] and [[Palestrina]]. However, according to [[Knud Jeppesen]]: "Bach's and Palestrina's points of departure are antipodal. Palestrina starts out from lines and arrives at chords; Bach's music grows out of an ideally harmonic background, against which the voices develop with a bold independence that is often breath-taking."<ref name="Katz"/>

According to Cunningham, linear harmony is "a frequent approach in the 20th-century...[in which lines] are combined with almost careless abandon in the hopes that new 'chords' and 'progressions,'...will result." It is possible with "any kind of line, diatonic or [[duodecuple]]."<ref name="Cunningham">Cunningham, Michael (2007). ''Technique for Composers'', p.144. ISBN 1-4259-9618-3.</ref> A notable example of linear counterpoint in the 20th century is Glenn Gould's String Quartet in F minor, Opus 1.<ref>http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/glenn-gould</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2012}}<!--The source fails to verify either that the quartet is notable or that it involves linear counterpoint at all.-->

==Dissonant counterpoint==
'''Dissonant counterpoint''' was originally theorized by [[Charles Seeger]] as "at first purely a school-room discipline," consisting of species counterpoint but with all the traditional rules reversed. First species counterpoint must be all dissonances, establishing "dissonance, rather than consonance, as the rule," and consonances are "resolved" through a skip, not step. He wrote that "the effect of this discipline" was "one of purification." Other [[aspects of music|aspects of composition]], such as rhythm, could be "dissonated" by applying the same principle (Charles Seeger, "On Dissonant Counterpoint," Modern Music 7, no. 4 (June–July 1930): 25-26).

Seeger was not the first to employ dissonant counterpoint, but was the first to theorize and promote it. Other composers who have used dissonant counterpoint, if not in the exact manner prescribed by Charles Seeger, include [[Ruth Crawford Seeger|Ruth Crawford-Seeger]], [[Carl Ruggles]], [[Henry Cowell]], [[Henry Brant]], [[Dane Rudhyar]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Fartein Valen]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]].<ref>Spilker, John D., [http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04032010-120836/unrestricted/Spilker_J_Dissertation_2010.pdf ''"Substituting a New Order": Dissonant Counterpoint, Henry Cowell, and the network of ultra-modern composers''], Ph.D. dissertation, [[Florida State University]], 2010.</ref>

==Contrapuntal radio==
[[Glenn Gould]] used what he considered a kind of counterpoint in his three radio documentaries: ''The Idea of North'', ''The Latecomers'', and ''The Quiet in the Land'' (see ''[[Solitude Trilogy|The Solitude Trilogy]]'').  Gould called this method "contrapuntal radio." It involves the voices of two or more people simultaneously speaking (or playing against each other), entering and leaving the work as in a [[fugue]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}
