'''Apus''' is a faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky, first defined in the late 16th century. Its name means "no feet" in [[Greek language|Greek]], and it represents a [[bird-of-paradise]] (which were once believed to lack feet). It is bordered by [[Triangulum Australe]], [[Circinus (constellation)|Circinus]], [[Musca]], [[Chamaeleon]], [[Octans]], [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] and [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]]. Its [[genitive]] is "Apodis".

==History==
Apus was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] and it first appeared on a 35&nbsp;cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].<ref name="ridpath"/>{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=76-77}}<ref name="UT">{{cite web |url = http://www.universetoday.com/19562/apus/ |title = Apus |last = Plotner |first = Tammy |publisher = Universe Today |date = 13 October 2008 |accessdate = 22 April 2012}}</ref>  Plancius called the constellation ''"Paradysvogel Apis Indica"''; the first word is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for 'bird of paradise,' of genus [[Pteridophora]], but the others are [[Latin]] for "Indian Bee," although "apis" (Latin for "bee") is presumably an error for "avis" or "bird".<ref name="ridpath">{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/apus.htm |title = Apus |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |work = Star Tales |accessdate = 10 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="UT"/>

The name "Apus" is derived from the Greek "apous", meaning "without feet", which referred to the Western conception of a bird-of-paradise as one without feet, a misconception perpetuated by the fact that the only specimens available in the West had both feet and wings removed.<ref name="ridpath"/> These specimens began to arrive in Europe in 1522, when the survivors of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s expedition brought them home.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=252}}

After its introduction on Plancius's globe, the first known depiction of the constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603, where it was called "Apis Indica".<ref name="ridpath"/><ref name="UT"/>

It was suggested by Richard Allen that Houtmann, who observed the southern constellations from the island of Sumatra, took his ideas for the formation of Apus (as well as [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]] and [[Indus]]) from the Chinese, who knew these stars as the "Little Wonder Bird.".<ref>Richard H. Allen (1899) Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, p. 43 <http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Apus*.html></ref>  Ridpath, however, disputes this possibility, arguing that the southern constellations were introduced later than Allen believed, and by different people altogether.<ref>Ridpath, Chapter 1.</ref>

When the [[Ming Dynasty]] Chinese astronomer [[Xu Guangqi]] adapted the European southern hemisphere constellations to the Chinese system in ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|The Southern Asterisms]]'', he combined Apus with some of the stars in [[Octans]] to form the "[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Exotic Bird]]" (異雀, ''Yìquè'').<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060729.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 29 日]</ref>
