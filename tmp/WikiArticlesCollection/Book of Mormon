{{Book of Mormon}}
The '''Book of Mormon''' is a [[sacred text]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], which adherents believe contains writings of ancient [[prophet]]s who lived on the [[Americas|American continent]] from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421.<ref>[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6730 "Praise to the Man"], 1979-11-04.</ref><ref>[[Church Educational System]] (1996, rev. ed.). [http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/bm-in-sm1996/manualindex.asp ''Book of Mormon Student Manual''] (Salt Lake City, Utah: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), ch. 6.</ref> It was first published in March 1830 by [[Joseph Smith]] as ''The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the [[Plates of Nephi]]''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=title page}}. In 1982, in an effort to clarify and emphasize its purpose, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) retitled its editions of the book to ''The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ'' {{harvtxt|LDS Church|2008}}.</ref>

According to Smith's account, and also according to the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as "[[reformed Egyptian]]"<ref>{{lds|Mormon|morm|9|32}}</ref> engraved on [[golden plates]]. Smith claimed that the last prophet to contribute to the book, a man named [[Moroni (Book of Mormon)|Moroni]], buried it in a [[Hill Cumorah|hill]] in present-day [[New York]] and then returned to earth in 1827 as an [[Angel Moroni|angel]],<ref>{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|pp=11, 18–19}}.</ref> revealing the location of the book to Smith and instructing him to translate it as evidence of the [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of Christ's true church in the [[End time#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|latter days]].

The Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]],<ref>E.g. {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|2}}</ref> the nature of the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]],<ref>E.g. {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|9}}</ref> [[eschatology]], redemption from physical and spiritual death,<ref>E.g. {{lds|Alma|alma|12}}</ref> and the organization of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|latter-day church]]. The pivotal event of the book is an [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus#The Book of Mormon|appearance of Jesus Christ]] to the Americas shortly after his resurrection.

The Book of Mormon is the earliest of the [[Standard Works|unique writings]] of the Latter Day Saint movement, the [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|denominations]] of which typically regard the text not only as scripture but also as a historical record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the [[Americas]].<ref>[http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng "Introduction"], Book of Mormon (1981 LDS Church ed.).</ref> The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books, titled after the individuals named as primary authors and, in most versions, divided into chapters and verses. It is written in English, very similar to the [[Early Modern English]] linguistic style of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible, and has since been fully or partially translated into 108 languages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ash |first=Michael R. |url=http://www.mormonfortress.com/kjv2.html |title=The King James Bible and the Book of Mormon |work=Mormon Fortress |year=1997 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}</ref>

{{Main|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Golden plates|Criticism of the Book of Mormon}}
Joseph Smith said that when he was seventeen <!-- do not edit age, JS was 17 at time of Moroni visit, see refs for clarification -->years of age an angel of God named [[Angel Moroni|Moroni]] appeared to him<ref name="life-js">“[https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith?lang=eng The Life and Ministry of Joseph Smith],” ''[[Teachings of Presidents of the Church]]: Joseph Smith'', (2007), xxii–25.</ref> and said that a collection of ancient writings, engraved on [[golden plates]] by ancient prophets, was buried in a [[Cumorah|nearby hill]] in [[Wayne County, New York]]. The writings were said to describe a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western Hemisphere 600 years before Jesus’ birth. According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days. Smith stated that he was instructed by Moroni to meet at the hill annually each September 22 to receive further instructions and that four years after the initial visit, in 1827, he was allowed to take the plates and was directed to translate them into English.<ref name="life-js"/><ref>{{lds|''Pearl of Great Price,'' Joseph Smith - History|js_h|1|59}}</ref>

Accounts of the way in which Smith dictated the Book of Mormon vary. Smith himself implied that he read the plates directly using spectacles prepared for the purpose of translating. Other accounts variously state that he used [[seer stones (Latter Day Saints)|seer stones]] placed in a top hat, or the [[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]].

Smith's first published description of the plates said the plates "had the appearance of gold". They were described by [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], one of Smith's early scribes, as "fastened together in the shape of a book by wires."<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Smith | first=Joseph, Jr. | author-link=Joseph Smith, Jr. | contribution=Wentworth Letter | title= Church History | place= [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] | journal=[[Times and Seasons]] | date=March 1, 1842 | volume=3 | issue=9 | pages=906–936 | url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n09.htm | ref=harv }}</ref> Smith called the engraved writing on the plates "[[reformed Egyptian]]".<ref>Only LDS linguists accept the existence of any language or character set known as "reformed Egyptian" as described in LDS tradition. The only example of reformed Egyptian extant is the "Caractors Document", also known as the "Anthon Transcript", a paper written by Smith with examples of what he claimed to be "reformed Egyptian" characters. See [[Reformed Egyptian]] for details and references.</ref> A portion of the text on the plates was also "[[Golden plates#"Sealed" portion|sealed]]" according to his account, so its content was not included in the Book of Mormon.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1842|p=707}}.</ref>

In addition to Smith's account regarding the plates, eleven others signed [[affidavits]] that they personally saw the golden plates and, in some cases, handled them. Their written testimonies are known as the Testimony of [[Three Witnesses]]<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/thrwtnss Testimony of Three Witnesses]</ref> and the Testimony of [[Eight Witnesses]].<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/eghtwtns Testimony of Eight Witnesses]</ref> These affidavits are published as part of the introductory pages to the Book of Mormon.

Smith enlisted the help of his neighbor, Martin Harris (one of the Three Witnesses), who later mortgaged his farm to underwrite the printing of the Book of Mormon, as a scribe during his initial work on the text. In 1828, Harris, prompted by his wife, [[Lucy Harris]], repeatedly requested that Smith lend him the current pages that had been translated. Smith reluctantly acceded to Harris' requests. Lucy Harris is thought to have stolen the [[Lost 116 pages|first 116 pages]].<ref name="Lucy Harris">{{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=163}}, {{Harvnb|Givens|2002|pp=33}}, {{Harvnb|Givens|2002|pp=33}}</ref> After the loss, Smith recorded that he had lost the ability to translate, and that Moroni had taken back the plates to be returned only after Smith repented.<ref>''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'', [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 3|Section 3]] and</ref><ref name="autogenerated2">{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Givens|2002}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=163–164}}</ref> Smith later stated that God allowed him to resume translation, but directed that he begin translating another part of the plates.

For some followers of the Latter Day Saint movement, unresolved issues of the book's [[Historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity]] and the lack of conclusive [[Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|archaeological]] evidence have led them to adopt a compromise position that the Book of Mormon may be the creation of Smith, but that it was nevertheless created through divine inspiration.<ref name=autogenerated4>Grant H.

===Title===
Smith stated that the title page, and presumably the actual title of the 1830 edition, came from the translation of "the very last leaf" of the golden plates, and was written by the prophet-historian [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]].<ref>Joseph Smith stated that the "title page is not by any means a modern composition either of mine or of any other man's who has lived or does live in this generation."</ref><ref name="Times and Seasons">{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Joseph |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1842 |month=October |title=Truth Will Prevail |journal=Times and Seasons |volume=III |issue=24 |page=943 |id= |url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n24.htm#943 |accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote= |ref=harv }}</ref> The title page states that the purpose of the Book of Mormon is "to [show] unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers;...and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations."<ref>The Book of Mormon [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/ttlpg Title Page]</ref>

===Organization===
The Book of Mormon is organized as a compilation of smaller books, each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader, beginning with the [[First Book of Nephi]] (1 Nephi) and ending with the [[Book of Moroni]].

The book's sequence is primarily chronological based on the narrative content of the book. Exceptions include the [[Words of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Ether]]. The Words of Mormon contains editorial commentary by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]]. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people who had come to America before the immigration described in 1 Nephi. 1 Nephi through [[Book of Omni|Omni]] are written in first-person narrative, as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the Book of Mormon is written in third-person historical narrative, said to be compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether).

Most modern editions of the book have been divided into chapters and verses. Most editions of the book also contain supplementary material, including the Testimony of [[Three Witnesses]] and the Testimony of [[Eight Witnesses]], which are statements by men who said they saw the golden plates with Joseph Smith and could verify their existence.

===Chronology===
{{Main|Book of Mormon chronology}}
The books from [[Book of First Nephi|First Nephi]] to [[Book of Omni|Omni]] are described as being from "the small plates of Nephi".<ref>{{lds|''Book of Mormon,'' Words of Mormon|w_of_m|1|3}}</ref> This account begins in ancient [[Jerusalem]] around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]], his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the [[Babylonians]] in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the [[Arabian peninsula]], and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship.<ref>{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|18|23}}</ref> These books recount the group's dealings from approximately 600 BC to about 130 BC, during which time the community grew and split into two main groups, which are called the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanite]]s, that frequently warred with each other.

Following this section is the [[Words of Mormon]]. This small book, said to be written in AD 385 by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]], is a short introduction to the books of [[Book of Mosiah|Mosiah]], [[Book of Alma|Alma]], [[Book of Helaman|Helaman]], [[Book of Third Nephi|Third Nephi]], and [[Book of Fourth Nephi|Fourth Nephi]].<ref name="Brief-explanation">[http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/explanation?lang=eng ''Book Of Mormon,'' A BRIEF EXPLANATION ABOUT THE BOOK OF MORMON]</ref> These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called "the large plates of Nephi" that detailed the people's history from the time of Omni to Mormon's own life. The book of Third Nephi is of particular importance within the Book of Mormon because it contains an account of a visit by Jesus from heaven to the [[Americas]] sometime after his [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and ascension. The text says that during this American visit, he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the [[Gospels]] of the [[Bible]] and he established an enlightened, peaceful society which endured for several generations, but which eventually broke into warring factions again.

The book of [[Book of Mormon (Mormon's record)|Mormon]] is an account of the events during Mormon's life. Mormon is said to have received the charge of taking care of the records that had been hidden, once he was old enough. The book includes an account of the wars, Mormon's leading of portions of the Nephite army, and his retrieving and caring for the records. Mormon is eventually killed in battle after having handed down the records to his son Moroni.

According to the text, Moroni then made an abridgment (called the [[Book of Ether]]) of a record from a previous people called the [[Jaredites]].<ref name="Brief-explanation"/> The account describes a group of families led from the [[Tower of Babel]]<ref>{{lds|Ether|ether|1|3}}</ref> to the Americas, headed by a man named [[Jared (Book of Mormon)|Jared]] and [[The Brother of Jared|his brother]]. The [[Jaredite]] civilization is presented as existing on the American continent beginning about 2500 BC,<ref>Joseph L. Allen, ''Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands'' (2003) p. 8.</ref>—long before Lehi's family arrived in 600 BC—and as being much larger and more developed. The dating in the text is only an approximation.

The [[Book of Moroni]] then details the final destruction of the Nephites and the [[idolatry|idolatrous]] state of the remaining society.<ref>[http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro?lang=eng ''Book Of Mormon,'' Book of Moroni Chapter Summaries]</ref> It mentions a few spiritual insights and some important doctrinal teachings,<ref>{{lds|''Book of Mormon,'' Moroni|moro|10}}</ref> then closes with Moroni's [[testimony]] and an invitation to [[prayer|pray]] to God for a confirmation of the truthfulness of the account.<ref>{{lds|Moroni|moro|10|4}}</ref>

===Doctrinal and philosophical teachings===
[[File:The Hill Cumorah by C.C.A. Christensen.jpeg|325px|left|thumb|A depiction of [[Joseph Smith]]'s description of receiving the golden plates from the [[angel Moroni]] at the Hill Cumorah.]]
The Book of Mormon contains doctrinal and philosophical teachings on a wide range of topics, from basic themes of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] to political and ideological teachings.

====Jesus====
Stated on the title page, The Book of Mormon's central purpose is for the "convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations."<ref>{{harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=Title Page}}</ref>

The book describes Jesus, prior to his birth, as a spirit "without flesh and blood", although with a spirit "body" that looked similar to how Jesus would appear during his physical life.<ref name="lds|Ether|ether|3|16">{{lds|Ether|ether|3|16}}.</ref> Jesus is described as "the Father and the Son".<ref>{{lds|Ether|ether|3|14}}.</ref> He is said to be:
:"God himself [who] shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people...[b]eing the Father and the Son — the Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son — and they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth."<ref>{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|15|1|14}}</ref>
Other parts of the book portray the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as "one."<ref>{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|19|22|23}}</ref> Beliefs among the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement encompass [[nontrinitarian]]ism (in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]) to [[Trinitarianism]] (particularly among the [[Community of Christ]]). See [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)]].

In furtherance of its theme of reconciling Jews and Gentiles to Jesus, the book describes a variety of visions or visitations to some of the early inhabitants in the Americas involving Jesus. Most notable among these is a described visit of Jesus to a group of early inhabitants shortly after his [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].<ref>See {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|11}} to {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26}}</ref> Many of the book's narrators described other visions of Jesus, including one by [[Brother of Jared|a narrator]] who, according to the book, lived thousands of years before Jesus, but who saw the "body" of Jesus' spirit thousands of years prior to his birth.<ref name="lds|Ether|ether|3|16"/> In another vision, according to the book, a [[Nephi, son of Lehi|different narrator]] described a vision of the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus,<ref>{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|11}}</ref> including a prophecy of Jesus' name,<ref>{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|3|8}}</ref> said to have taken place nearly 600 years prior to Jesus' birth.<ref>See {{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|10|4}}, {{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|19|8}}; See also {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|1}}</ref>

In the narrative, at the time of [[King Benjamin]] (about 130 BC), the Nephite believers were called "the children of Christ".<ref>{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|5|7}}</ref> At another place, the faithful members of the church at the time of [[Captain Moroni]] (73 BC) were called "Christians" by their enemies, because of their belief in Jesus Christ.<ref>{{lds|Alma|alma|46|13|15}}</ref> The book also states that for nearly 200 years after Jesus' appearance at the temple in the Americas,<ref>{{lds|4 Nephi|1|22-23}}</ref> the land was filled with peace and prosperity because of the people's obedience to his commandments.<ref>{{lds|4 Nephi|4_ne|1}}</ref> Later, the prophet [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]] worked to convince the faithless people of his time (A.D. 360) of Christ. The prophet [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]] is said to have buried the [[Golden Plates|plates]] with faith in Christ.<ref>See {{lds|Book of Mormon Title page|ttlpg}}</ref> Many other prophets in the book also wrote of the reality of the [[Messiah]].

Jesus spoke to the [[Jew]]s in [[Jerusalem]] of “other sheep” who would hear his voice,<ref>See {{lds|John|john|10|16}} in the [[King James Version]] of the Bible</ref> which the Book of Mormon claims meant that the Nephites and other remnants of the [[Ten Lost Tribes|lost tribes]] of [[Israel]] throughout the world were to be visited by Jesus after his [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].<ref>{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|15|13|24}}, {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|16|1|4}}, {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|29|7|14}}</ref>

====Other distinctive religious teachings====
On most religious issues, Book of Mormon doctrines are similar to those found in the Bible and among other Christian denominations. Among its distinctive theological interpretations are the following:
* When the Old Testament prophet [[Isaiah]] wrote of prophets who would "whisper out of the dust,"<ref>Isaiah 29:4</ref> he was referring to the publication of the Book of Mormon.<ref>{{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|26|15|16}}</ref>
* The [[Fall of Man]] is a prerequisite for procreation, and a necessary requirement for the return to God: "Adam fell that men might be, and men are, that they might have joy."<ref>{{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|2|25}}</ref>

====Teachings about political theology====
The book delves into [[political theology]] within a Christian or Jewish context. Among these themes are [[American exceptionalism]]. According to the book, the Americas are portrayed as a "land of promise", the world's most exceptional land<!--

On the issue of war and violence, the book teaches that war is justified for people to "defend themselves against their enemies".

==Religious significance==

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
The Book of Mormon (retitled in 1981 by the LDS Church as The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ) is one of four sacred texts or [[Standard Works|standard works]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The other texts are the [[Bible]] (the [[King James Version]]), the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]].<ref>E.g. {{citation |last= Nelson |first= Russell M. |authorlink= Russell M.

The Book of Mormon’s significance to the LDS Church was reiterated in the 1980s by [[Ezra Taft Benson]], the church's thirteenth [[President of the Church|president]].<ref>{{citation |last= Benson |first= Ezra Taft |authorlink= Ezra Taft Benson |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/11/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion?lang=eng |title= The Book of Mormon—Keystone of Our Religion |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |month= November |year= 1986 |page= 4}}</ref> In an August 2005 ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' message, LDS Church president [[Gordon B.

The LDS Church encourages discovery of the book’s truth by following the suggestion in its final chapter to study, ponder, and pray to God concerning its veracity. This passage is referred to as ''Moroni's Promise''.<ref>{{lds|Moroni|moro|10|3|5}}; see {{citation |last= Cook |first= Gene R. |authorlink= Gene R.

As of April 2011, the LDS Church has published more than 150 million copies of The Book of Mormon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Book of Mormon: 150 Million Copies|url=http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/60804/Book-of-Mormon-150-million-copies.html|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref>

===Community of Christ===
The [[Community of Christ]], formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, views the Book of Mormon as an additional witness of Jesus Christ and publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, [[Herald House]]. The Authorized Edition is based on the original printer's manuscript and the 1837 Second Edition (or Kirtland Edition) of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different. The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 "Revised Authorized Edition" which attempts to modernize some of the language.

In 2001, Community of Christ President [[W. Grant McMurray]] reflected on increasing questions about the Book of Mormon: "The proper use of The Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, in part because of long-standing questions about its historical authenticity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity."<ref>McMurray, W. Grant, [http://www.cofchrist.org/docs/NativeAmericanConference/keynote.asp "They "Shall Blossom as the Rose": Native Americans and the Dream of Zion,"]{{dead link|date=March 2013}} an address delivered February 17, 2001, accessed on Community of Christ website, September 1, 2006.</ref>

At the 2007 Community of Christ World Conference, President [[Stephen M. Veazey]] ruled out of order a resolution to "reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record." He stated that "while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church."<ref>Andrew M. Shields, "Official Minutes of Business Session, Wednesday March 28, 2007," in 2007 World Conference Thursday Bulletin, March 29, 2007. Community of Christ, 2007</ref>

=== Greater Latter Day Saint movement ===

There are a number of other [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|churches]] that are part of the Latter Day Saint movement.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=B.A. |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/lds.htm |title=The LDS Restorationist movement, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |work=ReligiousTolerance.org |date=June 8, 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}</ref> Most of these churches were created as a result of issues ranging from differing doctrinal interpretations and acceptance of the movement's scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, to disagreements as to who was the divinely chosen successor to Joseph Smith. These groups all have in common the acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. It is this acceptance which distinguishes the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement from other Christian denominations. Separate editions of the Book of Mormon have been published by a number of churches in the Latter Day Saint movement, along with private individuals and foundations not endorsed by any specific denomination.

==Historical authenticity==
{{Main|Historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon}}
{{See also|Criticism of the Book of Mormon|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Genetics and the Book of Mormon|Linguistics and the Book of Mormon|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon anachronisms}}

The archaeological, historical and scientific communities are generally skeptical about the claims of the Book of Mormon. Critics of such tend to focus on four main areas:

* The lack of correlation between locations described in the Book of Mormon and American archaeological sites.<ref>Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, writes (in a 1973 volume of Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought): "As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing [the historicity of The Book of Mormon], and I would like to state that there are quite a few Mormon archaeologists who join this group."</ref>

* References to animals, plants, metals and technologies in the Book of Mormon that archaeological or scientific studies have found no evidence of in post-[[Pleistocene]], [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America, frequently referred to as [[anachronisms]].<ref>Cecil H.

''The Mesoamerican Indian Languages''. Cambridge University Press.</ref>

* The [[Genetics and the Book of Mormon|lack of DNA evidence]] linking any [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American group]] to the ancient [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Near East]].<ref>The traditional view of the Book of Mormon suggests that Native Americans are principally the descendents of an Israelite migration around 600 BC. However, DNA evidence shows no Near Eastern component in the Native American genetic make-up. For example:<br />Simon G. Southerton. 2004. ''Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church''. Signature Books.<br />The entire book is devoted to the specific topic of DNA evidence and the Book of Mormon." ...[T]he DNA lineages of Central America resemble those of other Native American tribes throughout the two continents. Over 99 percent of the lineages found among native groups from this region are clearly of Asian descent. Modern and ancient DNA samples tested from among the Maya generally fall into the major founding lineage classes... The Mayan Empire has been regarded by Mormons to be the closest to the people of the Book of Mormon because its people were literate and culturally sophisticated. However, leading New World anthropologists, including those specializing in the region, have found the Maya to be similarly related to Asians. Stephen L. Whittington...was not aware of any scientists 'in mainstream anthropology that are trying to prove a Hebrew origin of Native Americans... Archaeologists and physical anthropologists have not found any evidence of Hebrew origins for the people of North, South and Central America.'" (pg 191)<br />D. Andrew Merriwether. 2006. "Mitochondrial DNA," ''Handbook of North American Indians''. Smithsonian Institution Press. Pg 817-830. "Kolman, Sambuughin, and Bermingham (1995) and Merriwether et al. (1996) used the presence of A, B, C, and D to argue for Mongolia as the location for the source population of the New World founders. More specifically perhaps, they argued that the present-day Mongolians and present-day Native Americans are both derived from the same ancestral population in Asia, presumably in the Mongolia-Southern Siberia-Lake Baikal region. T.G. Schurr and S.G. Sherry (2004) strongly favor a southern Siberian origin for the majority of lineages found in the New World." (pg 829)<br />Tatiana M. Karafet, Stephen L. Zegura, and Michael F. Hammer. 2006. "Y Chromosomes," ''Handbook of North American Indians''. Smithsonian Institution. Pp. 831-839. "Zegura et al. (2004) have presented the following scenario for the early peopling of the Americas based on Y chromosome data:  a migration of a single, polymorphic Asian population across Beringia with a potential common source for both North American founding lineages (Q and C) in the Altai Mountains of southwest Siberia. Since all their STR-based SNP lineage divergence dates between the Altai and North Asians versus Native Americans...ranged from 10,100 to 17,200 year ago, they favored a relatively late entry model." (pg. 839)<br />Defenders of the book's historical authenticity suggest that the Book of Mormon does not disallow for other groups of people to have contributed to the genetic make-up of Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Nevertheless, this is a departure from the traditional view that Israelites are the primary ancestors of Native Americans, and therefore would be expected to present some genetic evidence of Near Eastern origins. A recently announced change in the Book of Mormon's introduction, however, allows for a greater diversity of ancestry of Native Americans. See, for example, the following Deseret News article published on November 9, 2007: [http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695226049,00.html Intro Change in Book of Mormon Spurs Discussion]</ref>

Most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon to generally be a historically accurate account.<ref name = historicallyaccurate>"The limited success so far in swaying popular LDS opinion is a constant source of frustration for Mormon apologists...It appears that Mormons are generally content to picture the Book of Mormon story in a setting that is factually wrong. For most Mormons, the limited geography models create more problems than they solve. They run counter to the dominant literal interpretation of the text and contradict popular folklore as well as the clear pronouncements of all church presidents since the time of Joseph Smith", Simon G. Southerton (2004, Signature Books), ''Losing a Lost Tribe'', pp. 164-165.<br>"Some of the [Community of Christ]'s senior leadership consider the Book of Mormon to be inspired historical fiction. For leaders of the Utah church, this is still out of the question. [The leadership], and most Mormons, believe that the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon is what shores up Joseph Smith's prophetic calling and the divine authenticity of the Utah church", Southerton (2004), pg. 201.<br>Quotations from temple dedicatory sermons and prayers in Central and South America by President Gordon B. Hinckley in 1999-2000 continually refer to Native LDS members in attendance as "children of Lehi" (Southerton [2004], pp. 38-39).<br>"Latter-Day Saints believe their scripture to be history, written by ancient prophets...", Grant Hardy (2009, Yale University Press), "Introduction," ''The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text'', ed. Royal Skousen, pg. x.</ref> Within the Latter Day Saint movement there are several [[Mormon apologetics|apologetic]] groups that seek to reconcile the discrepancies in diverse ways. Among these apologetic groups, much work has been published by [[FARMS|Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), and [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR), attempting to defend the Book of Mormon as a literal history, countering arguments critical of its historical authenticity, or reconciling historical and scientific evidence with the text. One of the more common recent arguments is the [[limited geography model]], which conjectures that the people of the Book of Mormon covered only a limited geographical region in either [[Mesoamerica]], [[South America]], or the [[Great Lakes]] area.  The LDS Church continues to declare that science can support the Book of Mormon.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/01/mounting-evidence-for-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng |title= Mounting Evidence for the Book of Mormon |first= Daniel C. |last= Peterson |authorlink= Daniel C.

==Manuscripts==
The Book of Mormon was dictated by Joseph Smith to several [[scribe]]s over a period of nearly two years, resulting in an original [[manuscript]] that was eventually printed into the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, minus the first 116 pages of the [[Book of Lehi]], which were lost after Smith lent the uncopied manuscript to Martin Harris who gave them to his wife Lucy.<ref name="Lucy Harris"/> These pages were never returned and are assumed to be lost.<ref name="Lucy Harris"/> The original manuscript was then hand copied by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes into a manuscript for the printer.<ref name="Skousen">{{cite web | first = Royal | last = Skousen | title = Changes in the Book of Mormon | url = http://www.fairlds.org/FAIR_Conferences/2002_Changes_in_the_Book_of_Mormon.html | publisher =FAIR | location = 2002 FAIR Conference | format = Transcription of live presentation | accessdate = 2009-09-25}}</ref> It is at this point that initial [[copyediting]] of the Book of Mormon was completed.

==Editions==

=== Chapter and verse notation systems ===
The original 1830 publication did not have chapter and verse markers. Just as the Bible's chapter and verse notation system is a later addition of Bible publishers to books that were originally solid blocks of undivided text, the chapters and verse markers within the books of the Book of Mormon are mere conventions, not part of the original text.

Different publishers from different factions of the Latter Day Saint movement have published different competing chapter and verse notation systems. The two most significant are the LDS system, introduced in 1879, and the RLDS system, which is based on the original 1830 chapter divisions.<ref>The Zarahemla Research Foundation publishes a 48-page booklet titled "Book of Mormon Chapter & Verse: RLDS-LDS Conversion Table" to enable readers of an LDS edition to find references from an RLDS edition and vice versa.</ref>

The RLDS 1908 Edition, RLDS 1966 Edition, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) Edition and Restored Covenant Editions use the RLDS system while most other current editions use the LDS system.

===Textual criticism===

In 1989, scholars at [[Brigham Young University]] began work on a critical text edition of the Book of Mormon. Volumes 1 and 2, published in 2001, contain transcriptions of all the text variants of the English editions of the Book of Mormon, from the original manuscript to the newest editions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skousen|May 2001}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|January 2001}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|March 2001}}</ref> Volume 4, which is being published in parts, is a critical analysis of all the text variants. Volume 3, which is not yet published, will describe the history of all the English-language texts from Joseph Smith to today.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skousen|2004}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|2005}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|2006}}</ref>

Differences between the original and printer's manuscript, the 1830 printed version, and modern versions of the Book of Mormon have led some critics to claim that evidence has been systematically removed that could have proven that Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon, or are attempts to hide embarrassing aspects of the church's past.<ref name="Brody"/><ref name="Krakauer"/><ref name="Skousen"/>

=== Non-English translations ===
[[File:Book of Mormon translations.jpg|130px|right|thumb|Translations of the Book of Mormon.]]
{{See also|List of Book of Mormon translations}}
The LDS version of the Book of Mormon has been translated into 83 languages and selections have been translated into an additional 25 languages. In 2001, the LDS church reported that all or part of the Book of Mormon was available in the native language of 99% of [[Latter-day Saints]] and 87% of the world's total population.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/07/taking-the-scriptures-to-the-world?lang=eng |title= Taking the Scriptures to the World |journal= Ensign |month= July |year= 2001 |page= 24}}</ref>

Translations into languages without a tradition of writing (e.g., [[Kakchiqel language|Kakchiqel]], [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]]) are available on audio cassette.<ref>[http://www.ldscatalog.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10151&catalogId=10151&langId=-1 Welcome<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Translations into [[American Sign Language]] are available on videocassette and DVD.

Typically, translators are members of the LDS Church who are employed by the church and translate the text from the original English. Each manuscript is reviewed many times before it is approved and published.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/02/news-of-the-church?lang=eng |contribution= Translation Work Taking Book of Mormon to More People in More Tongues |title= News of the Church |journal= Ensign |month= February |year= 2005 |pages= 75–76 }}</ref>

In 1998, the LDS Church stopped translating selections from the Book of Mormon, and instead announced that each new translation it approves will be a full edition.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/02/news-of-the-church?lang=eng |contribution= Translation Work Taking Book of Mormon to More People in More Tongues |title= News of the Church |month= February |year= 2005 |journal= Ensign}}</ref>

==Representations in media==
[[File:HCP Nephi's Vision.PNG|thumb|right|300px|A scene from the Book of Mormon being depicted in the [[Hill Cumorah Pageant]]]]
Events of the Book of Mormon are the focus of several [[List of films of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church films]], including ''[[The Life of Nephi]]'' (1915), ''[[How Rare a Possession]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd]]'' (2000). Such films in [[LDS cinema]] (i.e., films not officially commissioned by the LDS Church) include ''[[The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey]]'' (2003) and ''[[Passage to Zarahemla]]'' (2007).

In 2003, a ''[[South Park]]'' episode titled "[[All About Mormons]]" parodied the origins of the Book of Mormon.

In 2011, a [[religious satire]] [[musical theatre|musical]] titled ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' premiered on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]].

[[Second Book of Nephi|Second Nephi]] [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.20-27#19 9:20–27] from the Book of Mormon is quoted in a funeral service in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Family Plot]]''.

== Distribution ==
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], which distributes free copies of the Book of Mormon, reported in 2011 that 150 million copies of the book have been distributed since its initial publication.<ref>[http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/60797/150-Million-and-Counting-The-Book-of-Mormon-reaches-another-milestone.html "150 Million and Counting: The Book of Mormon reaches another milestone"], ''[[Church News]]'', 2011-04-18.</ref>

The initial printing of the Book of Mormon in 1830 produced 5000 copies.<ref name = 150million>[http://lds.org/church/news/book-of-mormon-reaches-150-million-copies?lang=eng "Book of Mormon Reaches 150 Million Copies"], lds.org, 2011-04-20.</ref> The 50 millionth copy was printed in 1990, with the 100 millionth following in 2000 and reaching 150 million in 2011.<ref name =150million/>
