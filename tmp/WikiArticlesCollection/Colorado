Colorado is part of the [[Western United States]], the [[Southwestern United States]], and the [[Mountain States]]. Colorado is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|8th most extensive]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|22nd most populous]] of the [[50 United States]]. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,187,582 on July 1, 2012, an increase of +3.15% since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name=PopEstUS>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/national/totals/2012/index.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|format=[[comma-separated values|CSV]]|work=2012 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=December 2012|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref>

The state was named for the [[Colorado River]], which [[Conquistador#North America exploration|Spanish explorers]] named the ''Río Colorado'' for the [[Wiktionary:ruddy|ruddy]] ({{lang-es|[[Wiktionary:colorado|colorado]]}}) silt the river carried from the mountains.  On August 1, 1876, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed a proclamation admitting Colorado to the [[United States|Union]] as the 38th state.  Colorado is nicknamed the "[[List of U.S. state nicknames|Centennial State]]" because it became a state in the [[century|centennial year]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

Colorado is bordered by the [[Northwestern United States|northwest]] state of [[Wyoming]] to the north, the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] states of [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]] to the northeast and east, on the south by [[New Mexico]] and [[Oklahoma]], on the west by [[Utah]], and [[Arizona]] to the southwest. The four states of Colorado, [[New Mexico]], [[Utah]], and [[Arizona]] meet at one common point known as the [[Four Corners]], which is known as the heart of the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, [[High Plains (United States)|high plains]], [[mesa]]s, [[canyon]]s, [[plateau]]s, rivers, and [[Desert|desert lands]].

[[Denver]] is the capital and the [[Colorado municipalities by population|most highly populated city]] of Colorado. Residents of the state are properly known as "[[List of demonyms for U.S. states|Coloradans]]", although the archaic term "Coloradoan" is still used.<ref name=statestyle>[http://ccs.colostate.edu/style_guide/style_guide_az.aspx#state_names Writers Style Guide], Colorado State University.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Colorado}}
Colorado is notable for its diverse geography, ranging from alpine mountains, arid plains and deserts with huge sand dunes, deep canyons, sandstone and granite rock formations, rivers, lakes, and lush forests. 
The borders of Colorado were originally defined to be lines of latitude and longitude, making its shape a latitude-longitude* quadrangle which stretches from [[37th parallel north|37°N]] to [[41st parallel north|41°N]] latitude and from [[25th meridian west from Washington|102°03'W]] to [[32nd meridian west from Washington|109°03'W]] longitude ([[25th meridian west from Washington|25°W]] to [[32nd meridian west from Washington|32°W]] from the [[Washington Meridian]]).<ref name=Colorado_Enabling_Act/> Colorado, [[Wyoming]] and [[Utah]] are the only states which have boundaries defined solely by lines of latitude and longitude. When placing the border markers for the [[Territory of Colorado]], minor [[surveying]] errors resulted in several <!-- nearly imperceptible -->small kinks, most notably along the [http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=38.258671,-108.873138&spn=0.731113,1.235962&z=10 border] with the [[Territory of Utah]]. Once agreed upon by the federal, state, and territorial governments, those [[benchmark (surveying)|surveyors' benchmarks]] became the legal boundaries for the Colorado Territory, kinks and all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/mathtourist/mathtourist_08_30_07.html |title=Rectangular States and Kinky Borders |publisher=Maa.org |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref>

===Mountains===
The summit of [[Mount Elbert]] at {{convert|14440|ft|0}} in elevation in [[Lake County, Colorado|Lake County]] is the highest point of Colorado and the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=Mount_Elbert>{{cite ngs|id=KL0637|designation=Mount Elbert|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref> Colorado is the only U.S. state that lies entirely above {{convert|1000|m|0|sp=us}} elevation. The point where the [[Arikaree River]] flows out of [[Yuma County, Colorado]], and into [[Cheyenne County, Kansas]], is the lowest point in Colorado at {{convert|3317|ft|0}} elevation. This point, which holds the distinction of being the highest low elevation point of any state,<ref name=USGS>{{cite web| date = April 29, 2005 | url = http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest| title = Elevations and Distances in the United States| publisher = U.S. Geological Survey| accessdate =October 19, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=U.S. Geological Survey |title=Elevations and Distances |url=http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |accessdate=September 8, 2006}}</ref> is higher than the high elevation points of 18 states and the District of Columbia.
[[File:Picketwire Canyon.jpg|thumb|A view of the arid high plains in Southeastern Colorado]]

===Plains===
A little over one third of the area of Colorado is flat and rolling land. East of the Rocky Mountains are the [[Colorado Eastern Plains]] of the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]], the section of the Great Plains within Colorado at elevations ranging from roughly {{convert|3350|to|7500|ft|m}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/colorado-county-highpoints/532245|title=Colorado County Highpoints|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> The Colorado plains are usually thought of as [[prairie]]s, but actually they have many patches of [[deciduous forests]], [[butte]]s, and [[canyons]], much like the high plains in New Mexico as well. Eastern Colorado is presently mainly covered in farmland, along with small farming villages and towns. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is fair, averaging from {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm}} annually.<ref name=ccc>{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/climateofcolorado.php|title=Climate of Colorado |last=Doesken|first=Nolan J.|coauthors=[[Roger A. Pielke]], Sr., Odilia A.P. Bliss |date=January 2003|publisher=Colorado Climate Center – Department of Atmospheric Science – [[Colorado State University]]|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref>
[[maize|Corn]], wheat, [[hay]], [[soybeans]], and [[oats]] are all typical crops, and most of the villages and towns in this region boast both a [[water tower]] and a [[grain elevator]]. As well as the farming of crops, Eastern Colorado has a good deal of livestock raising, such as at cattle ranches and [[Intensive pig farming|hog farms]] and [[irrigation]] water is available from the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams, and also from subterranean sources, including [[artesian well]]s. However, heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline.
[[File:Condiv.JPG|thumb|[[Front Range]] Peaks west of Denver]]
===Front range===
Most of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The only other significant population centers are at [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] and [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] in western and southwestern Colorado.
===Continental Divide===
The [[Continental Divide]] extends along the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. Drainage water west of the Continental Divide flows to the southwest via the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].

Within the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large so-called "parks" or high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Colorado basin)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.

===Southern region===
[[File:Mt Herard sand.JPG|thumb|left|The tallest dunes in North America at [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]] in southern Colorado]]
In southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.

===Peaks===
To the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains.  Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].
[[File:SANJUANMTNS.JPG|thumb|Peaks of the [[San Juan Mountains]]]]

The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain about 54 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].<ref>{{cite web |author=U.S. Forest Service |title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12140|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year round.

Much of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snowcapped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. [[Mount Elbert]] is the highest summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of North America all lie within the state.

[[File:Lake CO.JPG|thumb|[[Hanging Lake]] near [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]]]]

===Colorado Western Slope===
The Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] and the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]), or by evaporation in its arid areas. Prominent in the southwestern area of the Western Slope is the [[Grand Mesa]] and the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range, and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah. The Colorado River flows through Glenwood Canyon and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] to [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute]], through the desert canyon of [[De Beque Canyon]], and into the arid desert of [[Grand Valley (Colorado)|Grand Valley]], of which the city of Grand Junction is located.

The city of [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], is the largest city on the Western Slope, Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of radio and [[television broadcasting]], newspapers, and higher education on the Western Slope. [[Colorado Mesa University]] in Grand Junction, [[Western State College of Colorado]] in Gunnison, and [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango are the only four-year colleges in Colorado west of the [[Continental Divide]].

Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway of Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]], which also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.

To the southeast of Grand Junction is the [[Grand Mesa]], said to be the world's largest flat-topped mountain. Other towns of the Western Slope include [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]] with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]].

The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which is not only a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeads. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado.

From west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands, desert plateaus, alpine mountains, National Forests, relatively flat grasslands, scattered forests, buttes, and canyons in the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=5689 |name=Pikes Peak, Colorado |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref>

The desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as, the [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].

[[File:Four Corners Monument (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Four Corners Monument]], with [[Ute Mountain]] in the distance]]
Colorado is one of four states in the United States that share a common geographic point the [[Four Corners]] together with Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. At this intersection, it is possible to stand in four states at once.

==Climate==
The [[climate]] of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [[Mountain States]] region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate.

As a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.

===Eastern Plains===
[[File:PivotWithDrops.JPG|thumb|[[Center pivot irrigation]] of wheat growing in [[Yuma County, Colorado|Yuma County]]]]

The climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: [[Cold semi-arid climate|BSk]]) with low [[humidity]] and moderate [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. The difference between the highs of the day and the cool of nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to the space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds. [[Denver]] has one of the highest number of annual sunshine hours and clear days of major cities in the United States, the sunshine hours being comparable to [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. The climate of Colorado is well suited for the utilization of [[evaporative cooler]]s and [[solar hot water]].

In summer, this area can have many days above {{convert|95|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and often {{convert|100|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Climate of Colorado">[http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm DRI.edu] Western Regional Climate Center. Retrieved October 24, 2006.</ref> On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 °F (−3.5 °C) to −10 °F (−23 °C).  About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from [[thunderstorm]]s, which can be severe, and from major [[snowstorm]]s that occur in the winter, and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.<ref name="Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=096427&refer=&cityname=Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America |title=Denver, Colorado Travel Weather Averages |publisher=Weatherbase |date= |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>

In much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of {{convert|70|°F|°C|abbr=on}} or higher in the winter.<ref name="Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America" /> The average July temperature is {{convert|55|°F|°C}} in the morning and {{convert|90|°F|°C}} in the afternoon. The average January temperature is {{convert|18|°F|°C}} in the morning and {{convert|48|°F|°C}} in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&nbsp;°F (22&nbsp;°C).<!--this is a temperature difference, so the convert template shouldn't be used here-->

===West of the plains and foothills===
West of the plains and foothills, the weather of Colorado is much less uniform. Even places a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography of the area. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate, which becomes an [[alpine climate]] at higher elevations. Humid [[microclimate]]s also exist in some areas. Generally, the wettest season in western Colorado is winter while June is the driest month.

The mountains have mild summers with many days of high temperatures between {{convert|60|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|85|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, although thunderstorms can cause sudden but brief drops in temperature. The winters bring abundant, powdery snowfall to the mountains with plenty of sunshine in between major storms. The western slope has high summer temperatures similar to those found on the plains, while the winters tend to be slightly cooler due to the lack of warming winds common to the plains and Front Range. Other areas in the west have their own unique climate.

===Extreme weather===
[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains.]]
Extreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although the majority of extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental divide in the spring and summer yet usually brief. [[Hail]] is a common sight in the mountains east of the divide and in the northwest part of the state. The Eastern Plains have had some of the biggest hail storms in North America.<ref name=ccc/>

The Eastern Plains are part of the extreme western portion of [[Tornado Alley]], some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 [[Limon, Colorado|Limon]] [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado and the 2008 [[Windsor, Colorado|Windsor]] [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF3]] tornado, which devastated the small town.<ref>{{cite web

The plains are also susceptible to occasional floods, which are caused both by [[thunderstorm]]s and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Denver's record in 1901 for the number of consecutive days above {{convert|90|°F|°C}} was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.<ref>{{cite web

Much of Colorado is a very dry state averaging only {{convert|17|in|mm}} of precipitation per year statewide and rarely experiences a time when some portion of the state is not in some degree of drought.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/pdfs/ahistoryofdrought.pdf |title=A History of Drought |format=PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of [[wildfire]]s in the state such as the [[Hayman Fire]], one of the largest wildfires in American history, and the [[Fourmile Canyon#Fourmile Canyon Fire|Fourmile Canyon Fire]] of 2010, which until the [[Waldo Canyon Fire]] of June 2012, and the [[Black Forest Fire]] approximately a year later,  was the most destructive wildfire in Colorado's recorded history.

However, there are some of the mountainous regions of Colorado which receive a huge amount of moisture via winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in such rivers as the [[Yampa River]], the [[Colorado River|Grand River]], the Colorado River, the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]], the North Platte River, and the South Platte River.
[[File:Overlook of Yampa River.jpg|thumb|250px|The Yampa River, from a high overlook.]]

Water flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of fellow southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, as well as midwest like Nebraska and Kansas, and also southern states like Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently) the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.

===Records===
The highest ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was {{convert|118|°F|°C}} on July 11, 1888, at [[Bennett, Colorado|Bennett]].  The lowest air temperature was {{convert|-61|°F|°C}} on February 1, 1985, at [[Maybell, Colorado|Maybell]].<ref name=StateMaxTemps>{{cite web | url = http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pub/data/special/maxtemps.pdf | title = Record Highest Temperatures by State | format = PDF | publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] | date = January 1, 2004 | accessdate =January 11, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=StateMinTemps>{{cite web | url = http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pub/data/special/mintemps.pdf | title = Record Lowest Temperatures by State | format = PDF | publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] | date = January 1, 2004 | accessdate =January 11, 2007 }}</ref>

===Earthquakes===
Despite its mountainous terrain, Colorado is relatively quiescent seismically.  The [[U.S.]] [[National Earthquake Information Center]] is located in [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]].

On August 22, 2011, a 5.3 [[Seismic scale|magnitude]] earthquake occurred nine miles [[Boxing the compass|WSW]] of the city of [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]].<ref>[http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsus/Maps/US2/36.38.-106.-104.php ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> No casualties and only small damage was reported. It was the second largest earthquake in Colorado.

{{Main|History of Colorado|Timeline of Colorado history}}
The region that is today the state of Colorado has been inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for more than 13,000 years. The [[Lindenmeier Site]] in [[Larimer County, Colorado|Larimer County]] contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating from approximately 11200 BC to 3000 BC. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] lived in the [[valley]]s and [[mesa]]s of the [[Colorado Plateau]].<ref>"[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]", Discovery News, September 20, 2010.</ref> The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], even as far east as the Front Range of present day. The [[Apache]] and the [[Comanche]] also inhabited the Eastern and Southeastern portions of the state as well. The [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] at times as well.

The United States acquired a territorial claim to the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803.  This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim of [[Spain]] to the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas River Basin]] as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of [[Santa Fé de Nuevo Méjico]].  [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region in 1806. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and then expelled from Mexico the following July.

The United States relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the United States admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[state of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of the [[Missouri Territory]], including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and would remain so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-Onís Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835–1836 fomented a dispute between the United States and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the United States with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.
[[File:Mexican Cession in Mexican View.PNG|thumb|Map of the Mexican cession, with the white representing the territory the United States received from Mexico. Well over half of Colorado was received during this treaty.]]

Most American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of [[State of Deseret|Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the [[Green River (Utah)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]] rivers. The federal government of the United States flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[state of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[European American|Euro-American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].
[[File:Anasazi Heritage Center.jpg|thumb|The Anasazi Heritage Center in [[Dolores, Colorado|Dolores]]]]

In 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.

The gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.

===Territory act===

Thirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].<ref name=ColoradoTerritory>{{cite web | url = http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/territory.pdf | title = An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Colorado | format = PDF | publisher = [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress]] | date = February 28, 1861 | accessdate =June 12, 2007}}</ref> The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged today. The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the [[Colorado River]] originated in the territory.<ref name=Colorado_River>Early explorers identified the [[Gunnison River]] in Colorado as the [[headwaters]] of the Colorado River. The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall Colorado River.</ref> In 1776, Spanish priest [[Silvestre Vélez de Escalante]] recorded that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the area knew the river as ''[[:es:Rio Colorado|el Rio Colorado]]'' for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.<ref>{{cite web |author=State of Colorado – Division of Information Technologies |url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/symbemb.htm#Name|title=State Names and Nicknames |accessdate=November 15, 2006}}</ref> In 1859, a [[U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=Macomb>Report of the exploring expedition from Santa Fé, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859: under the command of Capt. J. N. Macomb, Corps of topographical engineers, Volume 1 [http://www.archive.org/stream/reportofexplorin00unitrich#page/n5/mode/2up @ archive.org]</ref> The Macomb party designated the confluence as the source of the Colorado River.

On April 12, 1861, [[South Carolina]] artillery opened fire on [[Fort Sumter]] to start the [[American Civil War]]. While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.

In 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and ran off 500 head of their horses and mules. The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.

In 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along [[Sand Creek massacre|Sand Creek]]. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant [[Sand Creek massacre|massacre]] of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been mutilated and desecrated in hideous manner. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming [[U.S. President|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished.

In the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a determined few stayed on to develop mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in the Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to [[Julesburg, Colorado|Weir]], now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June of the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year.

===Statehood===
[[File:Georgetown loop 1899.jpg|thumb|The [[Georgetown Loop]] of the [[Colorado Central Railroad]] as photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1899]]
The [[United States Congress]] passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the [[Territory of Colorado]] to become a state.<ref name=Colorado_Enabling_Act>{{cite web|url=http://www.i2i.org/Publications/ColoradoConstitution/cnenable.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080507151300/http://www.i2i.org/Publications/ColoradoConstitution/cnenable.htm|archivedate=May 7, 2008|title=An Act to Enable the People of Colorado to Form a Constitution and State Government, and for the Admission of the Said State into the Union on an Equal Footing with the Original States|format=PDF|author=[[Forty-third United States Congress]]|date=March 3, 1875|accessdate=April 14, 2008}}</ref> On August 1, 1876 (28 days after the [[Centennial of the United States]]), U.S. President [[Ulysses S.

The discovery of a major silver lode near [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]] in 1878, triggered the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. The [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado's last, but greatest, gold strike at [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the [[suffrage|right to vote]] beginning on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a [[popular vote]] (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered.

Colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] met in Denver in 1908. By the [[United States Census, 1930|U.S. Census in 1930]], the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009. Colorado became one of two states to [[Legality of cannabis by US state|legalize cannabis]] with the passage of [[Colorado Amendment 64|a constitutional amendment in 2012]].

Three [[warship]]s of the [[U.S. Navy]] have been named the USS ''[[USS Colorado|Colorado]]''. The first USS ''Colorado'' was named for the Colorado River. The later two ships were named in honor of the state, including the [[battleship]] USS ''[[USS Colorado (BB-45)|Colorado]]'' which served in [[War in the Pacific|World War II in the Pacific]] beginning in 1941. At the time of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], this USS ''Colorado'' was located at the naval base in San Diego, Calif. and hence went unscathed.

Colorado has a high proportion of [[Hispanic]], mostly [[Mexican-American]], citizens in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado Springs, as well as the smaller cities of Greeley and Pueblo, and elsewhere. Colorado is well known for its strong Latino culture and presence. Southern, Southwestern, and Southeastern Colorado has a large number of [[Hispanos]], the descendants of the early Mexican settlers of colonial Spanish origin. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported Colorado's population as 8.2% Hispanic and 90.3% non-Hispanic white.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, and States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref>

The [[2000 United States Census]] found that 10.5% of people aged five and over in Colorado speak only Spanish at home, with the 2009 estimate being roughly 14%. Colorado also has a large immigration presence all throughout the state, which has led to Colorado cities being referred to as "Sanctuary Cities" for illegal immigrants as well. Colorado has the 4th highest percentage of undocumented people in the U.S., only behind Nevada, Arizona, California, and tied with Texas. An estimated 5.5–6.0% of the state's population is composed of illegal immigrants. Also, over 20% of the state's prisoners are undocumented inmates.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fred Elbel, CAIR |url=http://www.cairco.org/issues/issues_crime_colorado.html |title=Crime and illegal aliens in Colorado – CAIR – Colorado Alliance for Immigration Reform |publisher=Cairco.org |date=May 19, 2005 |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&state_id=8&mode=state_tops&order=r |title=Language Map Data Center |publisher=Mla.org |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> Colorado, like New Mexico, is very rich in archaic Spanish idioms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elcastellano.org/palabra.php?id=946 |title=talking about Colorado in "nada" |publisher=Elcastellano.org |date=June 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref>

The state has sizable numbers of Asian-Americans of [[Mongolian American|Mongolian]], [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Filipino American|Filipino]], [[Koreans|Korean]], [[Southeast Asian]] and [[Japanese American|Japanese]] descent. The highest population of Asian Americans can be found on the south and southeast side of Denver, as well as some on Denver's southwest side. The Denver metropolitan area is considered more liberal and diverse than much of the state when it comes to political issues and environmental concerns.

Colorado has a flat 4.63% [[income tax]], regardless of income level. Unlike most states, which calculate taxes based on federal ''adjusted gross income'', Colorado taxes are based on ''taxable income'' – income after federal exemptions and federal itemized (or standard) deductions.<ref>Colorado individual income tax return (2005) [http://www.revenue.state.co.us/PDF/05104f.pdf Revenue.state.co.us].

When state revenues exceed state constitutional limits, full-year Colorado residents can claim a sales tax refund on their individual state income tax return. Many counties and cities charge their own rates in addition to the base state rate. There are also certain county and special district taxes that may apply.

Real estate and personal business property are taxable in Colorado. The state's senior property tax exemption was temporarily suspended by the Colorado Legislature in 2003. The tax break is scheduled to return for assessment year 2006, payable in 2007.

Colorado has significant [[hydrocarbon]] resources. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], Colorado hosts seven of the Nation’s 100 largest natural gas fields and two of its 100 largest [[oil field]]s. Conventional and unconventional natural gas output from several Colorado basins typically account for more than 5 percent of annual U.S. natural gas production. Colorado’s [[oil shale]] deposits hold an estimated {{convert|1|Toilbbl|km3}} of oil – nearly as much oil as the entire world’s proven oil reserves; the economic viability of the oil shale, however, has not been demonstrated.<ref>{{cite web

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Colorado}}
[[File:Colorado.JPG|thumb|left|A Colorado state welcome sign]]
Colorado's transportation system is extensive and has been the genesis of world-class innovations in highway and railway construction as well as airport design, infrastructure development, and operational innovation.

Colorado's primary mode of transportation (in terms of passengers) is its highway system. [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|Interstate 25]] is the primary North/South highway in the state, connecting Denver, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, and Fort Collins, and extending north to Wyoming and south to New Mexico.  [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]] is the primary East/West corridor.  It connects Denver with the mountain communities, Grand Junction, and then west to points in Utah. The state is home to a network of US and Colorado highways that provide access to all principal areas of the state.  Smaller communities are only connected to this network via county roads.

It is also the fourth-largest hub of the world's largest airline, [[United Airlines]]. DIA is a [[focus city]] for [[Southwest Airlines]], which since commencing service to Denver in January 2006, has added over 50 destinations, making Denver its fastest-growing market. Denver International Airport is the only airport in the United States to have implemented an [[ISO 14001]]-certified environmental management system covering the entire airport.<ref>{{cite web |title=2009 Annual Report|url=http://business.flydenver.com/community/enviro/documents/annualReport2009.pdf|work=City & County of Denver Department of Aviation|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref>

Extensive public transportation bus services are offered both intra-city and inter-city—including the Denver metro area's extensive RTD services.  The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD) operates the popular [[RTD Bus & Light Rail]] transit system in the [[Denver Metropolitan Area]]. As of January 2013 the RTD rail system had 170 light rail vehicles, serving {{convert|47|mi|km}} of track.

[[Amtrak]] operates two rail passenger lines through Colorado, including the Glenwood Canyon route of the famed [[California Zephyr]], one of America's legendary passenger trains.
Colorado's contribution to world railroad history was forged principally by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] which began in 1870 and wrote the book on mountain railroading.  In 1988 the "Rio Grande" acquired, but was merged into, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] by their joint owner [[Philip Anschutz]]. On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], creating the largest railroad network in the United States.  The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading.  Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.

Colorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |title=Railroads and States |publisher=Aar.org |date= |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>

Like the federal government and all other U.S. states, Colorado's [[Constitution of the State of Colorado|state constitution]] provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches.

The [[Governor of Colorado]] heads the state's executive branch. The current governor is [[John Hickenlooper]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Colorado's other statewide elected executive officers are the [[Lieutenant Governor of Colorado]] (elected on a [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with the Governor), [[Secretary of State of Colorado]], [[Colorado State Treasurer]], and [[Attorney General of Colorado]], all of whom serve four-year terms.

The seven-member [[Colorado Supreme Court]] is the highest judicial court in the state.

The state legislative body is the [[Colorado General Assembly]], which is made up of two houses, the [[Colorado House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Colorado Senate|Senate]]. The House has 65 members and the Senate has 35. {{as of|2013}}, the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] holds a 18 to 17 majority in the Senate and a 37 to 28 majority in the House.

Most Coloradans are originally native to other states (nearly 60% according to the 2000 census),<ref>{{cite web

===Special districts===
The state of Colorado has more than 3,000 districts with taxing authority. These districts may provide schools, law enforcement, fire protection, water, sewage, drainage, irrigation, transportation, recreation, infrastructure, cultural facilities, business support, redevelopment, or other services.

Some of these districts have authority to levy sales tax and well as property tax and use fees. This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.

Some of the more notable Colorado districts are:
* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties
* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties
** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).
** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.
** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three "tiers" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.
*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.
*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.
*** Tier III has over 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.
** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.
* The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [[Denver Broncos]]' stadium [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]]
* Local Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of southeast Jefferson and Boulder counties

Colorado is considered a [[swing state]] in both state and federal elections. Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state the post-World War II era, only voting for the Democratic candidate in 1964 and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state by the turn of the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.

Colorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.

The state of Colorado is represented by its two [[United States Senator]]s:
* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 2]] – [[Mark Emery Udall]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2009–
* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 3]] – [[Michael Farrand Bennet]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]])<ref name=Bennet>[[Governor of Colorado|Governor]] [[Bill Ritter]] appointed [[Michael Bennet]] to serve the remaining two years of [[United States Senator]] [[Ken Salazar]] term of office which was left vacant on January 20, 2009, when new United States President [[Barack Obama]] appointed the Colorado Senator to serve in his [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] as [[United States Secretary of the Interior]].</ref> 2009–
Colorado is represented by seven [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]]:
* [[Colorado's 1st congressional district]] – [[Diana Louise DeGette]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 1997–
* [[Colorado's 2nd congressional district]] – [[Jared Schutz Polis]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2009–
* [[Colorado's 3rd congressional district]] – [[Scott Tipton]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2011–
* [[Colorado's 4th congressional district]] – [[Cory Gardner]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2011–
* [[Colorado's 5th congressional district]] – [[Douglas L. Lamborn|Douglas L. "Doug" Lamborn]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2007–

===Significant bills passed in Colorado===
On the November 8, 1932 ballot, Colorado approved the [[Repeal of Prohibition|repeal of alcohol prohibition]] more than a year before the federal government passed the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

In 2012, voters amended the state constitution to protect [[Colorado Amendment 64|"personal use" of marijuana for adults]], establishing a framework to regulate ''[[Cannabis]]'' in a manner similar to alcohol.  The state's retail pot regulations will be final by mid-October 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wyatt|first=Kristen|title=Colorado's Marijuana Industry: Legal, Not Cheap|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/colorados-marijuana-industry-legal-cheap-20011234|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}</ref>
