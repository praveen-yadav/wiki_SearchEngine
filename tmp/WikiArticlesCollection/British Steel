'''British Steel PLC''' was a major British [[steel]] producer. It originated as a [[nationalization|nationalised]] industry, the '''British Steel Corporation''' (BSC), formed in 1967.  This was converted to a public limited company, British Steel PLC, and privatised in 1988. It was once a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]]. The company merged with [[Koninklijke Hoogovens]] to form [[Corus Group]] in 1999.

==History==
Blair (1997) explores the history of the British Steel since the Second World War to evaluate the impact of government intervention in a market economy. Entrepreneurship was lacking in the 1940s; the government could not persuade the industry to upgrade its plants. For generations the industry had followed a patchwork growth pattern that proved inefficient in the face of world competition. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] came to power in 1945 committed to socialism. In 1946 it put the first steel development plan into practice with the aim of increasing capacity. It passed the "Iron and Steel Act of 1949," which meant nationalisation of the industry as the government bought out the shareholders. American [[Marshall Plan]] aid in 1948-50 reinforced modernisation efforts and provided funding for them. However, the reforms were dismantled by the Conservative governments in the 1950s. In 1967, under a Labour government again, the industry was again nationalised. But by then twenty years of political manipulation had left companies such as  British Steel with serious problems: a complacency with existing equipment, plants operating under capacity (low efficiency), poor quality assets, outdated technology, government price controls, higher coal and oil costs, lack of funds for capital improvement, and increasing world market competition. By the 1970s the Labour government had its main goal to keep employment high in the declining industry. Since British Steel was a main employer in depressed regions, it had to keep many mills and facilities operating at a loss. In the 1980s, Conservative Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] re-privatised BSC as British Steel. Under private control the company has dramatically cut its work force and undergone a radical reorganisation and massive capital investment to again become competitive in the world marketplace.<ref>Alasdair M. Blair, "The British iron and steel industry since 1945," ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1997) 26#3 pp 571-81</ref>

===Nationalisation===
BSC was formed from the assets of former private companies which had been nationalised, largely under the Labour government of [[Harold Wilson]], on 28 July 1967.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eYZinsF8qEAC&pg=PA315&lpg=PA315&dq=british+steel+28+july+1967&source=bl&ots=CxWML3MxSz&sig=kxKADGVk1QYUQhva6Jb8hmYLtTM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GjkTT6CpDYOg4gTtwNjPAw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=british%20steel%2028%20july%201967&f=false]</ref> Wilson's was the second attempt at nationalisation, [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain]] having been largely privatised by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments of the 1950s.  Only one steel company, [[Richard Thomas and Baldwins]], remained in public ownership throughout.

BSC was established under the Iron and Steel Act 1967, which vested in the Corporation the shares of the 14 major UK-based steel companies then in operation, being:
*[[David Colville & Sons|Colvilles Ltd]];
*[[Consett Iron Company|Consett Iron Company Ltd]];
*[[Dorman Long|Dorman Long & Company Ltd]];
*[[English Steel Corporation|English Steel Corporation Ltd]];
*[[GKN|GKN Steel Company Ltd]];
*[[John Summers & Sons|John Summers & Sons Ltd]];
*[[Lancashire Steel Corporation|The Lancashire Steel Corporation Ltd]];
*[[Park Gate Iron and Steel Company|The Park Gate Iron and Steel Company Ltd]];
*[[Richard Thomas and Baldwins|Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd]];
*[[Round Oak Steel Works|Round Oak Steel Works Ltd]];
*South Durham Steel & Iron Company Ltd;
*[[Steel Company of Wales|The Steel Company of Wales Ltd]];
*[[Stewarts & Lloyds|Stewarts & Lloyds, Ltd]]; and
*[[United Steel Companies|The United Steel Companies Ltd]].

At the time of its formation BSC comprised around 90 percent of the UK's steelmaking capacity, had around 268,500 employees and around 200 wholly or partly owned subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Africa, South Asia, and South America.<ref>[http://www.uksteel.org.uk/keydates.htm UK Steel:Key dates]</ref> 

Dorman Long, South Durham and Stewarts and Lloyds had merged as British Steel and Tube Ltd before vesting took place. BSC later arranged an exchange deal with [[Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]] Ltd (GKN), the parent company of GKN Steel, under which BSC acquired [[Dowlais Ironworks]] at [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and GKN took over BSC's [[Brymbo Steelworks]] near [[Wrexham]].

===Restructuring===
According to Blair (1997) British Steel faced serious problems at the time of its formation, including obsolescent plants; plants operating under capacity and thus at low efficiency; outdated technology; price controls that reduced marketing flexibility; soaring coal and oil costs; lack of capital investment funds; and increasing competition on the world market. By the 1970s the government adopted a policy of keeping employment artificially high in the declining industry. This especially impacted BSC since it was a major employer in a number of depressed regions.<ref>Alasdair M. Blair, "The British iron and steel industry since 1945," Journal of European Economic History Winter 1997, Vol. 26 Issue 3, pp 571-81</ref>

One of the arguments aired in favour of nationalisation was that it would enable steel production to be rationalised.  This involved concentrating investment on major integrated plants, placed near the coast for ease of access by sea, and closing older, smaller plants, especially those that had been located inland for proximity to coal supplies.

From the mid-1970s the (now loss-making) British Steel pursued a strategy of concentrating steelmaking in five areas: South Wales, [[South Yorkshire]], [[Scunthorpe]], [[Teesside]] and [[Scotland]]. This policy continued following the Conservative victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]].  Other traditional steelmaking areas faced cutbacks.  Under the Labour government of [[James Callaghan]], a review by Lord Beswick had led to the reprieve of the so-called 'Beswick plants', for social reasons, but subsequent governments were obliged under EU rules to withdraw subsidies.  Major changes resulted across Europe including, in the UK:

* At [[Consett]] the closure of the British Steel works in 1980 marked the end of steel production in the [[River Derwent, North East England|Derwent Valley]] and the decline of the area.

* At [[Corby]], the closure of the former Stewarts & Lloyds site in the early 1980s saw the loss of 11,000 jobs, leading to an initial unemployment rate of over 30%.<ref>[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/603/603ap33.htm Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions, HMSO]</ref>

* In Wales, works at East Moors (Cardiff), [[Ebbw Vale]] and [[Shotton, Flintshire|Shotton]] were closed.

* In Scotland, Western Europe's largest hot [[strip steel]] mill [[Ravenscraig steelworks]], near [[Motherwell]], [[North Lanarkshire]], was closed by British Steel in 1992, leading to huge unemployment in the area. It also led to the closure of several local support and satellite businesses, such as the nearby British Steel [[Clydesdale Works]] in [[Mossend]], [[Clyde Alloy]] in [[Netherton, North Lanarkshire|Netherton]] and equipment maker [[Anderson Strathclyde]]. Demolition of the site's landmark blue gasometer in 1996, and the subsequent cleanup operation, has created the largest [[brownfield]] site in [[Europe]]. This huge area between Motherwell and [[Wishaw]] is in line to be transformed into the new town of [[Ravenscraig]], a project partly funded by [[Tata Steel Europe|Corus]].

===Privatisation===
British Steel was [[privatization|privatised]] in 1988 by the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. It merged with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] steel producer ''Koninklijke Hoogovens'' to form [[Tata Steel Europe|Corus Group]] on 6 October 1999.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/362530.stm British Steel merges with Dutch rival] BBC, 7 June 1999</ref>  Corus itself was taken over in March 2007 by the Indian steel operator [[Tata Steel]].<ref>{{cite news |first=|last=|title=India's Tata wins race for Corus|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6315823.stm | publisher=BBC |date=31 January 2007 | accessdate=26 November 2007}}</ref>

==Chairmen==
*[[Julian Edward Alfred Mond, 3rd Baron Melchett|Lord Melchett]] (1967–1973)
*[[Monty Finniston]] (1973–1976)
*[[Charles Hyde Villiers|Charles Villiers]] (1976–1980)
*[[Ian MacGregor]] (1980–1983)
*[[Robert Haslam (industrialist)|Robert Haslam]] (1983-1986)
*[[Robert Scholey]] (1986-1992)

Ian MacGregor later became famous for his role as Chairman of the [[National Coal Board]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)]]. During the strike the "[[Battle of Orgreave]]" took place at British Steel's coking plant.

==Sponsorships==
In 1971, British Steel sponsored Sir [[Chay Blyth]] in his record-making non-stop [[circumnavigation]] against the winds and currents, known as 'The Impossible Voyage'. In 1992 they sponsored the [[Global Challenge|British Steel Challenge]], the first of a series of 'wrong way' races for amateur crews.

British Steel had agreed a sponsorship deal with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough Football Club]] during the [[1994-95 in English football|1994-95 season]], with a view to British Steel sponsored Middlesbrough shirts making their appearance [[1995-96 in English football|the following season]]. But the sponsorship deal was terminated before it commenced after it was revealed that [[United Kingdom|British]] steel only made up a tiny fraction of steel used in construction of the stadium - the bulk of the steel had been imported from [[Germany]].
