[[File:Amiga500 system.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 500]] (1987) was the best selling model]]

The '''Amiga''' was a family of [[personal computer]]s sold by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] in the 1980s and 1990s. The first model was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its graphical, audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers, such as the [[Commodore 64]], and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The best selling model, the [[Amiga 500]], was introduced in 1987 and became the leading home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in much of Western Europe. In [[North America]] success was more modest. The Amiga went on to sell approximately six million units.<ref name="reimer" /> Second generation Amiga systems (the [[Amiga 1200|A1200]] and the [[Amiga 4000|A4000]]) were released in 1992. However, poor marketing and failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the [[fourth generation game console]]s, [[Apple Macintosh]] and [[IBM PC compatible]]s.<ref name="reimer" /> The name Amiga was chosen because it is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for ''(female) friend'', and alphabetically it appears before Apple in lists of computer makers. Originally it was a project with [[Atari]] called [[Lorraine (given name)|Lorraine]], so therefore the female was used instead of the male and general version ''Amigo''.

Based on the [[Motorola 68000 family]] of [[microprocessor]]s, the machine sports a [[original Amiga chipset|custom chipset]] with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a [[pre-emptive multitasking]] operating system called [[AmigaOS]]. Originally the operating system, partly based [[TRIPOS]] and written in [[BCPL]], was called AmigaDOS and the GUI was called Workbench. Eventually, it was renamed AmigaOS. When renamed to AmigaOS the BCPL parts were rewritten in C language.

Although early Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of [[video game|games]] and creative software.<ref name="ad1987a" /><ref name="ad1987b" /> It was also a less expensive alternative to the [[Apple Macintosh]] and [[IBM PC]] as a general-purpose business or home computer. Initially, the Amiga was developed alongside various [[Commodore PC compatible systems|PC Compatible Systems by Commodore]] but later Commodore left the PC market. The platform became particularly popular for gaming and [[demo (computer programming)|demo]]s. It also found a prominent role in the [[desktop video]], [[video production]], and [[show control]] business, leading to affordable video editing systems such as the [[Video Toaster]]. The Amiga's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early "[[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]" music software. The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory led to the development of several 3D rendering packages, including [[LightWave 3D]] and [[Aladdin 4D]].

Since the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line, including [[Genesi]], [[Eyetech]], [[ACube Systems]] and A-EON Technology, and AmigaOS has influenced replacements, clones and compatible systems such as [[MorphOS]], [[AmigaOS 4]] and [[AROS]]. The demise of Commodore was due to numerous factors such as poor marketing, not being able to recruit sufficient third party developers, not developing the Amiga series to compete with cheaper [[Multimedia PC|PC clones with "multimedia" features]], and the advent of low-cost color-capable Macintosh models such as the [[Macintosh LC]].

{{Main|History of the Amiga}}

{{quote
| "The Amiga was so far ahead of its time that almost nobody—including Commodore's marketing department—could fully articulate what it was all about. Today, it's obvious the Amiga was the first multimedia computer, but in those days it was derided as a game machine because few people grasped the importance of advanced graphics, sound, and video. Nine years later, vendors are still struggling to make systems that work like 1985 Amigas.

}}

Development of the Amiga began in 1982 with [[Jay Miner]], developer of the [[Atari 800]] chip set, as the principal hardware designer of [[Amiga Corporation]]. It was initially intended to be a next generation [[video game]] machine, but was redesigned as a general purpose computer after the [[North American video game crash of 1983]].<ref name="AutoP5-1" /><ref name="AutoP5-2" /> A prototype of the full computer was shown to the public for the first time at the Summer [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in 1984.<ref name="AutoP5-3" /> In order to bring the design to market [[Commodore International]] bought Amiga Corporation and funded development. The first model was released in 1985 as simply "The Amiga from Commodore", later to be retroactively dubbed the [[Amiga 1000]]. The following year the Amiga product line was expanded with the introduction of two new models: the [[Amiga 2000]] for high-end graphics and business use, and the [[Amiga 500]] for home use. Commodore later released other Amiga models, both for low-end gaming use and high-end productivity use.

In 1994, Commodore filed for bankruptcy and its assets were purchased by [[Escom (computer corp)|Escom]], a German PC manufacturer, who created the subsidiary company Amiga Technologies. They re-released the A1200 and A4000T, and introduced a new [[68060]] version of the A4000T. However, Escom in turn went bankrupt in 1997. The Amiga brand was then sold to another PC manufacturer, [[Gateway 2000]], which had announced grand plans for it. However, in 2000, Gateway sold the Amiga brand without having released any products. The current owner of the trademark, [[Amiga, Inc]], licensed the rights to sell hardware using the Amiga or [[AmigaOne]] brand to computer vendors Commodore USA, Eyetech Group, Ltd. and A-Eon Technology CVBA. Unofficial AmigaOne clones were developed by Italian hardware company, Acube.

[[File:Amiga 600.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 600]]]]
[[File:Amiga 1200 with mouse, drives.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 1200]]]]
[[File:Amigacd32.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga CD32]]]]

At its core, the Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several [[coprocessor]]s, which handle audio, video and [[direct memory access]] independently of the [[Central Processing Unit]] (CPU). This architecture freed up the Amiga's processor for other tasks and gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly in terms of video-intensive applications and games.<ref name="amiga_hardware_ref" />

The general Amiga architecture uses two distinct [[bus (computing)|bus]] subsystems, namely, the chipset bus and the CPU bus. The chipset bus allows the custom coprocessors and CPU to address [[Amiga Chip RAM|"Chip RAM"]]. The CPU bus provides addressing to other subsystems, such as conventional RAM, ROM and the [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro II]] or [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro III]] expansion subsystems. This architecture enables independent operation of the subsystems; the CPU "Fast" bus can be much faster than the chipset bus. CPU expansion boards may provide additional custom buses. Additionally, "busboards" or "bridgeboards" may provide [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] or [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] buses.<ref name="amiga_hardware_ref" />

=== Central processing unit ===
The [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 68000 family|68000]] series of microprocessors was used in all Amiga models from Commodore. While the 68000 family has a [[32-bit]] design, the 68000 used in several early models is generally referred to as 16-bit.<ref name="AutoP5-4" /><ref name="AutoP5-5" /> The 68000 has a [[16-bit]] external [[data bus]] so must transfer 32 bits of data in two consecutive steps, a technique called [[multiplexing]]: all this is transparent to the software, which was 32-bit from the beginning. The 68000 could address 16 MB of physical memory. Later Amiga models featured full 32-bit CPUs with a larger address space and [[instruction pipeline]] facilities. Commodore's design choice to remain with the 68000 architecture ensured that code was backward-compatible across the Amiga line.

CPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third-party manufacturers. Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards. Such boards often featured faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] controllers.

Towards the end of Commodore's time in charge of Amiga development there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the 68000 series to higher performance [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processors, such as the [[PA-RISC]].<ref name="actuator" /><ref name="Haynie" /> However, these ideas were never developed before Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Despite this, third-party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of 68000 series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native [[Kernel (computing)|micro-kernel]] and software.<ref name="AutoP5-6" /><ref name="AutoP5-7" /> Later Amiga clones featured [[PowerPC]] processors only.

=== Custom chipset ===
The custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations, with a large degree of backward-compatibility. The [[Original Chip Set]] (OCS) appeared with the launch of the A1000 in 1985. OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved [[Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) in 1990 and finally by the partly 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) in 1992. Each chipset consists of several [[coprocessors]] which handle [[blitter|graphics acceleration]], digital audio, [[direct memory access]] and communication between various peripherals (e.g., CPU, memory and floppy disks). In addition, some models featured auxiliary [[Amiga custom chips|custom chip]]s which performed tasks such as [[SCSI]] control and display de-interlacing.

==== Graphics ====
[[File:HAM6example.png|thumb|A 4096 color [[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM]] picture created with [[Photon Paint]] in 1989]]

All Amiga systems can display full-screen animated graphics with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 ([[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB Mode]]) or 4096 colors ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]). Models with the AGA chipset (A1200 and A4000) also have non-EHB 64, 128, 256 and 262144 ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]) color modes and a palette expanded from 4096 to [[True Color|16.8 million colors]].

The Amiga chipset can ''[[genlock]]'': adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do [[Character generator|character generation]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. Some frequent users of this ability included wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and "desktop video". The [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga.

In 1988 the release of the Amiga A2024 fixed-frequency [[monochrome]] monitor with built-in [[framebuffer]] and flicker fixer hardware provided the Amiga with a choice of high-resolution graphic modes (1024×800 for NTSC and 1024×1024 for PAL).<ref name="AutoP5-8" />

==== ReTargetable Graphics ====
{{main|ReTargetable Graphics}}

ReTargetable Graphics is an [[application programming interface|API]] for [[device driver]]s mainly used by 3rd party graphics hardware to interface with [[AmigaOS]] via a set of [[library (computing)|libraries]]. The software libraries may include software tools to adjust [[Display resolution|resolution]], screen colors, [[Cursor (computers)#Mouse cursor|pointers]] and screenmodes. It will use available hardware and will not extend the capabilities in any way. Amiga [[Intuition (Amiga)|intuition.library]] is limited to [[color depth|display depths]] of 8-bits but RTG libraries makes is possible to handle higher depths like 24-bits.

==== Sound ====
The sound chip, named Paula, supports four [[pulse-code modulation|PCM]] sample based sound channels (two for the left speaker and two for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see [[Nyquist limit]]). The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga's low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter's status, a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter. Paula can read directly from the system's [[Random-access memory|RAM]], using direct memory access (DMA), making sound playback without CPU intervention possible.

Although the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels, software such as ''[[OctaMED]]'' uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels, and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14-bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least.

The quality of the Amiga's sound output, and the fact that the hardware is ubiquitous and easily addressed by software, were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years. Third-party sound cards exist that provide [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] functions, multi-track [[direct-to-disk recording]], multiple hardware sound channels and 16-bit and beyond resolutions. A retargetable sound API called [[AHI (Amiga)|AHI]] was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the [[Operating system|OS]] and software.

=== Kickstart firmware ===
{{Main|Kickstart (Amiga)}}

Kickstart is the [[firmware]] upon which AmigaOS is [[booting|bootstrap]]ped. Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of AmigaOS and then attempt to boot from a [[bootable]] [[volume (computing)|volume]], such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive. Most models (excluding the Amiga 1000) come equipped with Kickstart on an embedded [[Read-only memory|ROM-chip]].

=== Keyboard and mouse ===
[[File:Amiga Mouse.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Amiga mouse]]

The keyboard on Amiga computers was similar to that found on a mid 80s IBM PC: 10 function keys, a numeric keypad, and 4 separate directional arrow keys. Caps Lock and Control shared space to the left of A. Missing were the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys: these were accomplished on Amigas by pressing shift and the appropriate arrow key. The Amiga keyboard added a Help key, the lack of which made it necessary to use a function key for this purpose on PCs (usually F1). In addition to the Control and Alt modifier keys, the Amiga had 2 'Amiga' keys, rendered as 'Open Amiga' and 'Closed Amiga' similar to the Open/Closed Apple logo keys on Apple II keyboards. The left was used to manipulate the operating system (moving screens and the like) and the right delivered commands to the application. The absence of Num lock freed space for more math symbols around the number pad. Contemporary Macintosh computers, for comparison, lacked function keys completely.

The mouse had two buttons like Windows, but unlike Windows pressing and holding the right button replaced the system [[status line]] at the top of the screen with a Maclike [[menu bar]]. Like on [[Mac OS]] before [[Mac OS 8]], menu options were selected by releasing the button over that option, not by left clicking.

=== Other peripherals and expansions ===
[[File:Amiga Sound Sampling Hardware.jpg|thumb|upright|8-bit sound sampling hardware for the Amiga]]

The Amiga was one of the first home computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available. As a result of this and the Amiga's audio and video capabilities, the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video.

Many expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware, such as memory expansions, [[SCSI]] controllers, CPU boards, and graphics boards. Other upgrades include [[genlock]]s, network cards for [[Ethernet]], [[modems]], [[sound card]]s and samplers, [[Video capture|video digitizers]], extra [[serial port]]s, and [[Parallel ATA|IDE]] controllers. Additions after the demise of Commodore company are [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cards. The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards. These were sometimes combined into the one device.

Early CPU accelerator cards feature full 32-bit CPUs of the 68000 family such as the [[Motorola 68020]] and [[Motorola 68030]], almost always with 32-bit memory and usually with [[floating point unit|FPUs]] and [[Memory management unit|MMUs]] or the facility to add them. Later designs feature the [[Motorola 68040]] or [[Motorola 68060]]. Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs. Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers.

Phase5 designed the [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] boards ([[Blizzard PPC]] and [[PowerUP (accelerator)#Cyberstorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]]) featuring both a 68k (a 68040 or 68060) and a PowerPC (603 or 604) CPU, which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time and share the system memory. The PowerPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations; a powerful CPU is needed to run [[MAME]] for example, but even decoding [[JPEG]] pictures and [[MP3]] audio was considered heavy computation at the time. It is also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run [[Linux]] on the PPC via project Linux APUS, but a PowerPC-native AmigaOS promised by Amiga Technologies GmbH was not available when the PowerUP boards first appeared.<ref name="AutoP5-9" />

24-bit graphics cards and video cards were also available. Graphics cards are designed primarily for 2D artwork production, workstation use, and later, gaming. Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals, and processing and manipulating video.

Perhaps the most famous video card in the North American market was the ''NewTek [[Video Toaster]]''. This was a powerful video effects board which turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer which found its way into many professional video environments.  One particularly well-known use was to create the special effects in early series of [[Babylon 5]]{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}. Due to its [[NTSC]]-only design, it did not find a market in countries that used the [[PAL]] standard, such as in Europe. In PAL countries, the ''OpalVision'' card was popular, although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster. Low-cost [[Timebase correction|timebase correctors]] (TBC) specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards.

Various manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A1200 and A4000, allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as Voodoo graphic cards, [[Sound Blaster]] sound cards, 10/100 Ethernet cards, and TV tuner cards. Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards which contained an Intel x86 series chip, allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC.

PowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers, PCI busboards with Ethernet, sound and 3D graphics cards, and tower cases allowed the A1200 and A4000 to survive well into the late nineties.

Expansion boards were made by [[Richmond Sound Design]] that allow their [[show control]] and [[sound design]] software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances, allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio, lighting, automation, relay and voltage control channels spread around a large theme park, for example. See [[Amiga software]] for more information on these applications.

Track-to-track delay is on the order of {{nowrap|~94 ms}}. The default capacity is {{nowrap|880 kB}}<!-- 80*2*11*512 = 901120 -->. Many clone drives were available, and products such as [[Individual Computers Catweasel|the Catweasel]] make it possible to read and write Amiga and other special disc formats on standard x86 PCs.<ref name="AutoP5-10" />
* [[NE2000]]-compatible [[PCMCIA]] Ethernet cards for Amiga 600 and Amiga 1200<ref name="AutoP5-11" />

==== Serial ports ====
The Commodore A2232 provided {{nowrap|7× RS-232C}} [[serial port]]s.  Each port can be driven independently at speeds of {{nowrap|50 - 19 200 bit/s.}}  There is however a driver available on [[Aminet]] that allows {{nowrap|2 of}} the serial ports to be driven at {{nowrap|115 200 bit/s.}}<ref name="bboah_a2232">{{cite web|title=Big Book of Amiga Hardware - Commodore: A2232 |url=http://www.bboah.com/index.php?action=artikel&cat=58&id=2464&artlang=en |date=2009-01-25|accessdate=2013-06-21|publisher=bboah.com}}</ref>  The serial card made use of the [[MOS Technology 65CE02|65CE02]] CPU<ref name="bboah_a2232img">{{cite web|title=a2232_big.jpg |url=http://www.bboah.com/download_photos/a2232_big.jpg |date=2008-08-01|accessdate=2013-06-21|publisher=bboah.com}}</ref> clocked at {{nowrap|3.58 MHz}}.<ref name="bboah_a2232"/>  This CPU were also part of the [[MOS Technology 4510|CSG 4510]] CPU core that were used in the [[Commodore 65]] computer.

==== Networking ====
Amiga had three networking interface APIs:

* AS225: the official Commodore TCP/IP stack [[Application programming interface|API]] with hardcoded drivers in revision 1 (AS225r1) for the [[AMD Lance Am7990|A2065 Ethernet]] and the A2060 Arcnet interfaces.<ref name="amigahi_netfaq_AmiTCP" /> In revision 2 (AS225r2) the SANA-II interface was used.
* SANA-II: a standardized API for hardware of network interfaces. It uses an inefficient buffer handling scheme, and lacks proper support for [[Promiscuous mode|promiscuous]] and [[multicast]] modes.
* Miami Network Interface (MNI): an API that doesn't have the problems which SANA-II suffers from. It requires [[AmigaOS]] v2,04 or higher.

Different network media were used:

== Models and variants ==
{{Main|Amiga models and variants}}

The original Amiga models were produced from 1985 to 1996.<ref name="AutoP5-12" /> They are, in order of appearance: [[Amiga 1000|1000]], [[Amiga 2000|2000]], [[Amiga 500|500]], [[Amiga 1500|1500]], [[Amiga 2500|2500]], [[Amiga 3000|3000]], [[Amiga 3000UX|3000UX]], [[Amiga 3000T|3000T]], [[Amiga CDTV|CDTV]], [[Amiga 500+|500+]], [[Amiga 600|600]], [[Amiga 4000|4000]], [[Amiga 1200|1200]], [[Amiga CD32|CD32]], and [[Amiga 4000T|4000T]]. The PowerPC based [[AmigaOne]] was later produced from 2002 to 2005, and [[AmigaOne X1000|again]] in 2012. Several [[Genesi|companies]] and private persons have also released Amiga [[Clone (computer science)|clones]] and still do so today.

=== Commodore Amiga ===
[[File:Amiga 1000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 1000]] (1985) was the first model released.<ref name="AutoP5-13" />]]
[[File:Amiiga4000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 4000]] (1992) was the last desktop computer made by Commodore]]

The first Amiga model, the Amiga 1000, was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphics, video and audio capabilities. In 2006, [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating "''Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world's first multimedia, multitasking personal computer''".<ref name="AutoP5-14" />

Following the A1000, Commodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the [[Amiga 2000]] in 1987, the [[Amiga 3000]] in 1990, and the [[Amiga 4000]] in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options. However, the best selling models were the budget models, particularly the highly successful [[Amiga 500]] (1987) and the [[Amiga 1200]] (1992). The [[Amiga 500+]] (1991) was the shortest lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the [[Amiga 600]] (1992), which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.<ref name="AutoP5-15" />

The [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]], launched in 1991, was a [[CD-ROM]] based all-in-one multimedia system. It was an early attempt at a multi-purpose multimedia appliance in an era before multimedia consoles and CD-ROM drives were common. Unfortunately for Commodore, the system never achieved any real commercial success. Like the [[Commodore 64 Games System|Commodore 64GS]] that was a video game console based on a computer, the CDTV was designed as a video game console and multimedia platform. It had existed before the Sony [[Playstation]] and [[Sega Saturn]], but had influenced them. It competed with the [[TurboGrafx-CD|Turbo-Grafx-16 CD]] and [[Sega Mega-CD]] systems when it was being sold.

Commodore's last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was an attempt to capture a portion of the highly competitive 1990s console market with the [[Amiga CD32]] (1993), a 32-bit CD-ROM games console. Though discontinued after Commodore's demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe. The CD32 was a next generation CDTV, and it was designed to save Commodore by entering the growing video game console market.

Following purchase of Commodore's assets by Escom in 1995, the A1200 and A4000T continued to be sold in small quantities until 1996, though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity.

Several Amiga models contained references to songs by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The B-52s]]. Early A500 units, at least, had the words "B52/ROCK LOBSTER"<ref name="AutoP5-16" /> [[Printed circuit board#Manufacturing|silk-screen printed]] onto their [[printed circuit board]], a reference to the popular song "[[Rock Lobster]]" The [[Amiga 600]] referenced "JUNE BUG" (after the song "Junebug") and the [[Amiga 1200]] had "CHANNEL Z" (after "[[Channel Z (song)|Channel Z]]").<ref name="AutoP5-17" />

Most original casing was made from [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastics which may become brown with time. This can be reversed by using the public domain chemical mix "[[Retr0bright]]".

=== AmigaOS 4 systems ===
{{Main|AmigaOS 4}}

AmigaOS 4 (OS4) is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems. It is mainly based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code, with some parts of version 3.9. Currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards, on the Teron series based [[AmigaOne]] computers built by [[Eyetech]] under license by Amiga Inc, on the [[Pegasos|Pegasos II]] from [[Genesi]]/[[Bplan|bPlan GmbH]], on the [[Acube Systems]] [[Sam440ep]] / [[Sam460ex]] / [[AmigaOne 500]] systems and on the [[A-EON]] [[AmigaOne X1000]].

AmigaOS 4.0 had been available only in developer pre-releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December 2006.<ref name="AutoP5-18" /> Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc. and [[Hyperion Entertainment]] (the Belgian company which is developing the OS), the commercial AmigaOS 4 had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards.

AmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November 2007.<ref name="AutoP5-19" /> Version 4.1 was released in August 2008 for AmigaOne systems,<ref name="AutoP5-20" /><ref name="AutoP5-21" /> and in May 2011 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards.<ref name="AutoP5-22" /> The most recent release of AmigaOS for all supported platforms is 4.1 update 5.<ref name="AutoP5-23" /> Starting with release 4.1 update 4 there is an Emulation drawer containing official AmigaOS 3.x ROMs (all classic Amiga models including CD32) and relative Workbench files.

[[Acube Systems]] entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS 4 to its [[Sam440ep]] and [[Sam460ex]] line of PowerPC-based motherboards.<ref name="AutoP5-24" /> In 2009 a version for [[Pegasos II]] from [[Genesi]]/bPlan GmbH]was released in co-operation with Acube Systems.<ref name="AutoP5-25" /> In 2012, A-EON Technology Ltd manufactured and released the [[AmigaOne X1000]] to consumers through their distributor, AmigaKit.com.

=== Amiga hardware clones ===
Long-time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga-clone market with their DraCo non-linear video editing system.<ref name="AutoP5-26" /> It appears in two versions, initially a tower model and later a cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by the [[Motorola 68060]] processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support [[FireWire]] for video [[Input/output|I/O]]. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro-II]] expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of {{nowrap|30 MB/sec}} transfer rates (faster than Commodore's [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro-III]]). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for non-linear video editing.

In 1998, Index Information released the Access, an Amiga-clone similar to the Amiga 1200, but on a motherboard which could fit into a standard [[Drive bay#5%"|5¼" drive bay]]. It features either a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[Motorola 68030|68030]] CPU, with a redesigned [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset, and runs AmigaOS 3.1.

In 1998, former Amiga employees (John Smith, Peter Kittel, [[Dave Haynie]] and Andy Finkel to mention few) formed new company called PIOS. Their hardware platform, PIOS One, was aimed at Amiga, Atari and Macintosh users. The company was renamed to Met@box in 1999 until it folded.<ref name="AutoP5-27" />

The NatAmi (short for ''Native Amiga'') hardware project began in 2005 with the aim of designing and building an Amiga [[Home computer remakes|clone]] motherboard that is enhanced with modern features.<ref name="AutoP5-28" /> The NatAmi motherboard is a standard [[Mini-ITX]]-compatible form factor computer motherboard, powered by a Motorola/Freescale [[68060]] and its chipset. It is compatible with the original Amiga chipset, which has been inscribed on a programmable FPGA [[Altera]] chip on the board. The NatAmi is the second Amiga clone project after the [[Minimig]] motherboard, and its history is very similar to that of the [[C-One]] mainboard developed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]] and Jens Schönfeld. From a commercial point of view, Natami's circuitry and design are currently [[Closed Source]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} One goal of the NatAmi project is to design an Amiga-compatible motherboard that includes up-to-date features but that does not rely on emulation (as in [[WinUAE]]), modern PC [[Intel]] components, or a modern [[PowerPC]] mainboard. As such, NatAmi is not intended to become another evolutionary heir to classic Amigas (such as with [[AmigaOne]] or [[Pegasos]] computers). This "purist" philosophy essentially limits the resulting processor speed but puts the focus on bandwidth and low latencies. The developers also recreated the entire Amiga chipset, freeing it from Classic Amiga legacy limitations such as two [[megabytes]] of audio and video graphics RAM as in the [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA chipset]], and rebuilt this new chipset by programming a modern [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] [[Altera]] Cyclone IV chip. Later, the developers decided to create from scratch a new software-form processor chip, codenamed "N68050" that resides in the physical Altera FPGA programmable chip.<ref name="AutoP5-29" />

In 2006, two new Amiga clones were announced, both using [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]] custom chipset. The first, the [[Minimig]], is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren. Referred to as "new Amiga hardware",<ref name="minimig" /> the original model was built on a [[Xilinx]] Spartan-3 development board, but soon a dedicated board was developed. The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise, Agnus, Paula and [[Amiga custom chips#Gary|Gary]] chips as well as both 8520 [[MOS Technology CIA|CIAs]] and implements a simple version of [[Amiga custom chips#Amber|Amber]]. The rest of the chips are an actual 68000 CPU, ram chips, and a PIC microcontroller for [[BIOS]] control.<ref name="minimig" /> The design for Minimig was released as [[open source]] on July 25, 2007. In February, 2008, an Italian company [[Acube Systems]] began selling Minimig boards. A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor, providing more functionality such as write access and support for hard disk images. The Minimig core has been ported to the FPGArcade "Replay" board. The Replay uses an FPGA with about {{nowrap|3 times}} more capacity and which does support the AGA chipset and a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] [[Soft core (synthesis)|soft core]] with [[Motorola 68030|68030]] capabilities. The Replay board is designed to implement many older computers and classic arcade machines.

The second is the Clone-A system announced by [[Individual Computers]]. As of mid 2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.<ref name="individual" />

In 2011 by ArcadeRetroGaming, called the Multiple Classic Computer, which emulates the Commodore 64. Support for Amiga software is planned.<ref name="AutoP5-30" />

=== Emulation ===
{{Main|Amiga emulation}}

Like many popular but discontinued platforms, the Amiga has been the target of various emulation projects so that software developed for the Amiga can be run on other computer platforms without the original hardware. Such emulators attempt to replicate the functionality of the Amiga architecture in software. As mentioned above, attempts have also been made to replicate the Amiga chipset in [[FPGA]] chips.<ref name="AutoP5-31" />

One of the most challenging aspects of emulation is the design of the Amiga chipset, which relies on cycle-critical timings. As a result, early emulators did not always achieve the intended results though later emulator versions can now accurately reproduce the behavior of Amiga systems.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Operating systems ==

=== AmigaOS ===
[[File:AmigaOne X1000 02.jpg|thumb|AmigaOne X1000 running AmigaOS 4.1]]

{{Main|AmigaOS}}
{{quote
| "[AmigaOS] remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years, incorporating a small kernel and tremendous [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]]. The biggest difference is that the AmigaOS could operate fully and multitask in as little as {{nowrap|250 K}} of address space.
| ''[[John C. Dvorak]], PC Magazine'', October 1996.<ref name="AutoP5-32" />
}}

AmigaOS is a single-user [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] [[operating system]]. It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Original versions run on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors, while [[AmigaOS 4]] runs only on PowerPC microprocessors. At the time of release AmigaOS put an operating system that was well ahead of its time into the hands of the average consumer. It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] multitasking.

Another notable feature was the combined use of both a [[command-line interface]] and [[graphical user interface]]. [[AmigaDOS]] was the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] the native graphical windowing, [[Icon (computer)|icon]]s, menu and pointer environment for file management and launching applications. Notably, AmigaDOS allowed long [[filename]]s (up to 107 characters) with [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] and did not require [[file extension]]s. The [[windowing system]] and user interface engine which handles all input events is called [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]].<ref name="amiga_intuition_ref" />

The multi-tasking kernel was called [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]]. It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system, providing pre-emptive multitasking with prioritised round-robin scheduling. It enabled true pre-emptive multitasking in as little as 256 kB of free memory.<ref name="amiga_rkm_libs_exec" />
<ref name="holloway_oo_amiga_exec" />

Like other operating systems of the time, the OS lacks [[memory protection]]. This was because the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[CPU]] does not include a [[memory management unit]] and therefore there is no way to enforce protection of memory.<ref name="google.groups.com (Memory Protection)" /> Although this speeds and eases [[inter-process communication]] (programs can communicate by simply passing a [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] back and forth), the lack of memory protection made the AmigaOS more vulnerable to [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] from badly behaving [[Computer program|programs]] than other multitasking systems that did implement memory protection (Amiga OS is one of the few microkernel-based operating systems not to implement memory protection),<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Lr8ldHhh_wsC&lpg=PA74&ots=9a5En0ab4F&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Tech Book 1 - Published articles Oct 2006 - June 2008 - Michael Reed - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref> and Amiga OS is fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in [[AmigaOS 4]] and could be retrofitted to old AmigaOS systems using Enforcer or CyberGuard tools.

The problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore's initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS's underlying software routines, but also to the hardware itself, enabling intrepid programmers who cut their teeth on the Commodore 64 to [[Peek and Poke|POKE]] the hardware directly, as was done on the older platform. While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast, sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos, it also contributed to system instability as some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level. For this reason, when the new [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset was released, [[Commodore International|Commodore]] declined to release low-level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines.

==== Influence on other operating systems ====
AmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems. [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS]] clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems. AmigaOS also influenced [[BeOS]], which featured a centralized system of [[Amiga support and maintenance software#Datatypes|Datatypes]], similar to that present in AmigaOS. Likewise, [[DragonFlyBSD]] was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]] who is a former Amiga developer.<ref name="AutoP5-33" /><ref name="AutoP5-34" /> [[WindowLab]] and [[amiwm]] are among several [[window manager]]s for the [[X Window System]] seek to mimic the Workbench interface. IBM licensed the Amiga GUI from Commodore in exchange for the REXX language license. This allowed OS/2 to have the WPS (Work Place Shell) GUI shell for OS/2 2.0 a 32 bit operating system.<ref>[http://www.os2bbs.com/os2news/OS2Warp.html OS/2 News, OS/2 BBS]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Doug McIlroy |url=http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch03s02.html#os_2 |title=OS/2 Eric S. Raymond Operating System Comparisons The Art of Unix Programming |publisher=Catb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>

=== Unix and Unix-like systems ===
Commodore-Amiga produced [[Amiga Unix]], informally known as Amix, based on AT&T [[UNIX System V|SVR4]]. It supports the [[Amiga 2500]] and Amiga 3000 and was included with the [[Amiga 3000UX]]. Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware-accelerated windowing system which can scroll windows without copying data. Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors.

Other, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including Linux and [[NetBSD]]. Both require a CPU with [[Memory management unit|MMU]] such as the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] with [[Motorola 68851|68851]] or full versions of the [[Motorola 68030|68030]], [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]]. There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards. [[Debian]] and [[Yellow Dog Linux]] can run on the AmigaOne.

There is an official, older version of [[OpenBSD]]. The last Amiga release is 3.2. [[Minix]] 1.5.10 also runs on Amiga.<ref name="AutoP5-35" />

=== Emulating other systems ===
{{Main|Emulation on the Amiga}}

The Amiga is able to emulate other computer platforms ranging from many 8-bit systems such as the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, [[Apple II]] and the [[TRS-80]]. The Commodore PC-Transformer software emulated an IBM 5150 at 1&nbsp;MHz in Monochrome mode. Later PC-Bridgecards were a full hardware PC on a card with 8086/80286/80386 Intel chips running MS-DOS and Windows in an Amiga window. A-Max emulated an Apple Macintosh using a serial port dongle that had a Macintosh ROM on it. The Amiga had the 68000 CPU to run Mac 68K code and could read Macintosh 3.5" floppies. The Atari ST was also emulated. [[MAME]] (the arcade machine emulator) is also available for Amiga systems with PPC accelerator card upgrades.

== Amiga software ==
{{Main|Amiga software}}

In the late 1980s and early 1990s the platform became particularly popular for gaming, [[demoscene]] activities and creative software uses. During this time commercial developers marketed a wide range of games and creative software, often developing titles simultaneously for the [[Atari ST]] due to the similar hardware architecture. Popular creative software included, [[3D computer graphics software|3D rendering]] (ray-tracing) packages, [[raster graphics editor|bitmap graphics editors]], [[desktop video]] software, software development packages and "[[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]" music editors.

Until the late 1990s the Amiga remained a popular platform for non-commercial software, often developed by enthusiasts, and much of which was freely redistributable. An on-line archive, [[Aminet]], was created in 1992 and until around 1996 was the largest public archive of software, art and documents for any platform.

== Marketing ==
[[File:Amiga-90sLogo.gif|thumb|Logo used by Commodore in the US during the late 1980s]]
[[File:Recent Amiga.svg|thumb|Amiga Technologies logo incorporating the "Boing Ball" (1996)]]

The name ''Amiga'' was chosen by the developers from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for a female friend, and because they knew Spanish,<ref name="AutoP5-36" /> and because it occurred before [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Atari]] alphabetically. It also conveyed the message that the Amiga computer line was "user friendly" as a pun or play on words.<ref name="AutoP5-37" />

The first official Amiga logo was a rainbow-colored double [[checkmark]]. In later marketing material Commodore largely dropped the checkmark and used logos styled with various typefaces. Though it was never adopted as a [[trademark]] by Commodore, the "Boing Ball" has been synonymous with Amiga since its launch. It became an unofficial and enduring theme after a visually impressive animated demonstration at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984 showing a checkered ball bouncing and rotating. Following Escom's purchase of Commodore in 1996, the Boing Ball theme was incorporated into a new logo.<ref name="AutoP5-38" />

Early Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, though the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer.<ref name=ad1987a/><ref name=ad1987b/> Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s Commodore primarily placed advertising in computer magazines and occasionally in national newspapers and on television.

== Legacy ==
Since the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line:

* [[Genesi]] sold PowerPC based hardware running AmigaOS compatible [[MorphOS]];
* [[Eyetech]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2002 to 2005 running [[AmigaOS 4]];
* [[ACube Systems]] sells the [[AmigaOS]] 3 compatible [[Minimig]] system with a Freescale MC68SEC000 CPU (Motorola 68000 compatible) and [[AmigaOS 4]] compatible [[Sam440]] / [[Sam460]] / [[AmigaOne 500]] systems with PowerPC processors;
* A-EON Technology Ltd sells the [[AmigaOS 4]] compatible [[AmigaOne X1000]] system with P.A. Semi [[PWRficient]] PA6T-1682M processor.
* AmigaKit sells numerous items from aftermarket components to refurbished classic systems.

AmigaOS and MorphOS are commercial proprietary operative systems. AmigaOS 4, based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code with some parts of version 3.9, is developed by [[Hyperion Entertainment]] and runs on PowerPC based hardware. MorphOS is developed by MorphOS Team and is continued on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] PowerPC based hardware.

There is also [[AROS]], a free and open source operative system (re-implementation of the AmigaOS 3.1 APIs), for Amiga 68k, x86 and ARM hardware (one version runs Linux-hosted on the [[Raspberry Pi]]). In particular, AROS for Amiga 68k hardware aims to create an open source Kickstart ROM replacement for emulation purpose and/or for use on real "classic" hardware.<ref name="AutoP5-39" />

== Amiga community ==
After Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, there remained a very active Amiga community, which continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned it. The most popular Amiga magazine, ''[[Amiga Format]]'', continued to publish editions until 2000, some six years after Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Another magazine, ''[[Amiga Active]]'', was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001. Several magazines are in publication today, notably ''Amiga Future'',<ref name="AutoP5-40" /> which is available in both English and German; ''Bitplane.it'',<ref name="AutoP5-41" /> a bi-monthly magazine in Italian; and ''AmigaPower'',<ref name="AutoP5-42" /> a long-running French magazine.

In spite of declining interest in the platform there was a bi-weekly specialist column in the UK weekly magazine [[Micro Mart]]. There is also a fan web site,<ref name="AutoP5-43" /> that has served as a community discussion and support resource since the 1994 bankruptcy. Other popular English-language ''[[Internet forum|fora]]'' also exist, particularly amiga.org since 1994 and amigaworld.net<ref name="AutoP5-44" /> and English Amiga Board.<ref name="AutoP5-45" />

== Notable historic uses ==
{{fiction trivia|date=August 2012}}

The Amiga series of computers found a place in early computer graphic design and television presentation. Below are some examples of notable uses and users:

* Season 1 and part of season 2 of the television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' were rendered in LightWave 3D on Amigas.<ref name="lurk-effects" /><ref name="lurk-thornton" /> Other television series using Amigas for special effects included ''[[SeaQuest DSV]]''<ref name="AutoP5-46" /> and ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]''.<ref name="AutoP5-47" />

In addition, many other celebrities and notable individuals have made use of the Amiga:<ref name="AutoP5-48" />

* [[Andy Warhol]] was an early user of the Amiga and appeared at the launch,<ref name="AutoP5-49" /> where he made a computer artwork of [[Debbie Harry]].<ref name="AutoP5-50" /> Warhol used the Amiga to create a new style of art made with computers, and was the author of a multimedia opera called ''"you are the one"'' which consists of an animated sequence featuring images of actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] assembled in a short movie with a soundtrack. The video was discovered on two old Amiga floppies in a drawer in Warhol's studio and repaired in 2006 by the Detroit [[Museum of New Art]].<ref name="AutoP5-51" /> The pop artist has been quoted as saying: ''"The thing I like most about doing this kind of work on the Amiga is that it looks like my work in other media"''.<ref name="AutoP5-52" /><ref name="AutoP5-53" />
* A pioneer of the [[Digital Art]] movement, [[Laurence Gartel]], along with Jeff Bruette,<ref name="AutoP5-54" /> personally taught Andy Warhol how to use the Amiga and relevant software.<ref name="AutoP5-55" />
* Actor [[Dick Van Dyke]] was a self-described "rabid" user of the Amiga, although he has since switched to other platforms and sold most of his Amiga equipment.<ref name="AutoP5-56" /><ref name="AutoP5-57" />
* Artist [[Jean Giraud|Jean "Moebius" Giraud]] credits the Amiga he bought for his son as a bridge to learning about "using paint box programs".<ref name="AutoP5-58" /> He uploaded some of his early experiments to the file sharing forums on [[CompuServe]].
* [[Tom Fulp]] is noted as saying he used the Amiga as his first computer for creating cartoons and animations.<ref name="AutoP5-59" />
* The [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' contains a computer animated music video parody of the [[Dire Straits]] song "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]", titled "[[Money For Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies]]". According to the DVD commentary track, this spoof was created on an Amiga home computer.<ref name="AutoP5-60" />
* [[Rolf Harris]] used an Amiga to digitize his hand-drawn art work for animation on his television series, ''Rolf's Cartoon Club''.
* [[Todd Rundgren]]'s video "Change Myself" was produced with Toaster and Lightwave.
* An Amiga 1000 can be seen in the movie ''[[Disorderlies]]'' in the background running a heart animation.
* An Amiga 4000 was in Michael Jackson's movie ''[[Michael Jackson's Ghosts|Ghosts]]''. At the left of the screen, an Amiga monitor and keyboard can be easily seen at the end credit. (at exactly 38:40)
* Scottish pop artist [[Calvin Harris]] composed his debut album ''[[I Created Disco]]'' with an [[Amiga 1200]].<ref name="AutoP5-61" />
* [[Susumu Hirasawa]], a [[Japan]]ese [[Progressive rock|Progressive]]-[[Electronic music|Electronic]] [[artist]] is known for using Amigas to compose and perform music, aid his live shows and make his promotional videos. He has also been inspired by the Amiga, and has referenced it in his lyrics. His December 13, 1994 "Adios Jay" Interactive Live Show was dedicated to (then recently deceased) Jay Miner. He also used the Amiga to create the virtual drummer TAINACO, who was a CG rendered figure whose performance was made with Elan Performer and was projected with DCTV. He also composed and performed "Eastern-boot", the AmigaOS 4 boot jingle. He was an important figure in the Japanese Amiga community, and published several essays in the AMIGA Forum from December 1998 to March 2002, which were republished in 2012 as the e-book ''Near Future Never Come'', together with an interview, a model introduction,a photo glossary and "Eastern-boot".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shop.fascination.co.jp/index.php?main_page=document_product_info&cPath=5&products_id=30 |title=Near Future Never Come / Hirasawa Susumu [H-0001&#93; - 1,800円: Shop Fascination, Online Store |publisher=Shop.fascination.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref> He once said: "AMIGA is the machine which can accept any plans of amateurs like me and make them realised.

=== Technology ===
The Amiga was also used in a number of hard applications:

* Amigas were used in various [[NASA]] laboratories to keep track of multiple low orbiting satellites, and were still used up to 2003/2004 (dismissed and sold in 2006). This is another example of long lifetime reliability of Amiga hardware, as well as professional use. Amigas were also used at Kennedy Space Center to run strip-chart recorders, to format and display data, and control stations of platforms for [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rocket]] launches.<ref name="AutoP5-64" /><ref name="AutoP5-65" />
* [[Mount Palomar Observatory]] used Amigas to calibrate and control the [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] in their telescopes, as well as to display and store the digitized images they collected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n29/mode/2up|title=Info magazine issue 13}}</ref>
* [[London Transport Museum]] developed their own interactive multi-media software for the CD32. The software included a walkthrough of various exhibits and a virtual tour of the museum.<ref name="AutoP5-66" />
* Amiga 500 motherboards were used, in conjunction with a [[Laserdisc]] player and [[genlock]] device, in arcade games manufactured by [[American Laser Games]].<ref name="AutoP5-67" />
* A custom [[Amiga 4000T]] motherboard was used in the HDI 1000 medical ultrasound system built by Advanced Technology Labs (now part of Philips Medical Systems).<ref name="AutoP5-68" />
* Four Amiga 2000s were used from 1988 to 1991 to develop the digital displays panels installed in the M1-A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank built by General Dynamics Land Systems. In the General Dynamics Simulation Laboratory, the Amigas interfaced with a central simulation environment computer and produced graphics for the display panels. During demonstrations at Fort Knox, the Amigas did not interact with each other, but instead operated in "remote mode" because the simulation environment computer was not portable.
