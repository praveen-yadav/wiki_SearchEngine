A '''country''' is a region legally identified as a distinct entity in [[political geography]]. A country may be an independent [[sovereign state]] or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-[[sovereignty|sovereign]] or formerly sovereign [[political division]], or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated [[nation|people]]s with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the [[League of Nations]] in 1937 and reaffirmed by the [[United Nations]] in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.

Sometimes the word country is used to refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/framelodgmentattachments/C9CB248BCF472C8BCA257664002343B3 |title=Acts Interpretation Act 1901 - Sect 22: Meaning of certain words |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/federal%5fct/1997/912.html |title=The Kwet Koe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs &amp; Ors [1997&#93; FCA 912 (8 September 1997)|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/84411.pdf |title=U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 2—General |format=PDF |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref> while other times it refers only to [[State (polity)|states]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/cs/politicalgeog/a/statenation.htm| title=Geography: Country, State, and Nation |accessdate=2008-11-12 |last=Rosenberg |first=Matt}}</ref> For example, the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' uses the word in its "Country name" field to refer to "a wide variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, [[uninhabited islands]], and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#T |title=CIA - The World Factbook |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref><sup id=Note_1>[[#Notes|[Note 1]]]</sup>

==Etymology and usage==
<!-- ''Basically a country has a particular boundary on the surface of earth through which one country can be seperated from the other.'' Removed this addition: "Do not seek narrowly to define the word country without first considering the range of dictionary definitions such as OED and Chambers (British); Macquarie (Australian); Webster (American)." -->

The word ''country'' has developed from the [[Late Latin]] ''contra'' meaning "against", used in the sense of "that which lies against, or opposite to, the view", i.e. the landscape spread out to the view.<ref name="country">{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 0198611862 |title = country}}</ref> From this came the [[Late Latin]] term ''contrata'', which became the modern [[Italian language|Italian]] ''[[contrada]]'', and [[Provence|Provençal]] and French equivalents.  In many ways this defined the [[Agonism|agonistic]] world view of the early Christian identity in Europe.<ref>John Burt Foster, Wayne Jeffrey Froman, ''Thresholds of western culture: identity, postcoloniality, transnationalism'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, p.208</ref>  Several different senses of the term developed in [[Middle English]] from the 13th century, all reflecting a sense of either opposition, or occupation.<ref name="country"/>

In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the [[indefinite article]] – "a country" – is now a [[synonym]] for [[Sovereign state|state]], or a former sovereign state, in the sense of sovereign territory or "district, native land".<ref>[[OED]], Country</ref> Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the [[West Country]] in England, the [[Black Country]] (a heavily industrialized part of England), "Constable Country" (a part of [[East Anglia]] painted by [[John Constable]]), the "big country" (used in various contexts of the [[American West]]), "coal country" (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.<ref name="oed">{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 0198611862}}</ref>

The equivalent terms in French and other [[Romance language]]s (''[[Pays (France)|pays]]'' and variants) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English "country", instead derived from, [[pagus]], which designated the territory controlled by a medieval [[count]], a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the [[German Länder]], as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many "pays" that are officially recognised at some level, and are either [[natural region]]s, like the [[Pays de Bray]], or reflect old political or economic unities, like the [[Pays de la Loire]]. At the same time the United States and Brazil are also "pays" in everyday French speech.

A version of "country" can be found in the modern [[French language]] as ''contrée'', based on the word ''cuntrée'' in [[Old French]],<ref name="oed" /> that is used similarly to the word "pays" to define regions and unities, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian ''contrada'' is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.

==Sovereignty status==
{{See also|List of sovereign states}}
The term "country" is used to refer to [[sovereign states]]. There is no universal agreement on the number of "countries" in the world, since a number of states have [[List of states with limited recognition|disputed sovereignty status]]. There are 206 total states, with 193 states participating in the [[United Nations]], two observer states and 11 other states (if the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] are included, but there are only a few states have recognised them as sovereign). All are defined as states by [[declarative theory of statehood]] and [[constitutive theory of statehood]]. The latest proclaimed state is [[South Sudan]].

Although not sovereign states, [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are referred to as [[Home Nations|separate countries]], even though collectively they form the country known as the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="Lib of Congress">{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/law/help/uk.php|title=Legal Research Guide: United Kingdom|publisher=[[Law Library of Congress]]|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2013-03-29|quote=The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the collective name of four countries, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Some are possessions of sovereign states, as several states have overseas [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] (such as the [[British Virgin Islands]] ([[United Kingdom]]) and [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] ([[France]])), with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own. Such dependent territories are sometimes listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries, and may be treated as a "[[country of origin]]" in international trade, as [[Hong Kong]] is.{{cn|date=July 2013}}
