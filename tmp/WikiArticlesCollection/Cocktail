A '''cocktail''' is a beer or an [[Distilled beverage|alcoholic]] [[mixed drink]] that contains three or more ingredients—at least one of the ingredients must be a [[Distilled beverage|spirit]], one sweet/sugary and one sour/bitter.<ref>[[OED]] ''cocktail, n.''</ref>

Cocktails were originally a mixture of  spirits, sugar, water, and [[bitters]].<ref>{{cite book

==History==

The origin of the word ''cocktail'' is disputed.

The first recorded use of the word ''cocktail'' is found in ''The Morning Post and Gazetteer in London, England'' on March 20, 1798:<ref>{{cite book

The word cocktail, according to the [[Oxford English dictionary]], lists the word originating in the U.S.

{{quote|Drank a glass of cocktail—excellent for the head...Call'd at the Doct's. found Burnham—he looked very wise—drank another glass of cocktail.}}

A definition of ''cocktail'' appeared in the May 13, 1806, edition of  ''The Balance and Columbian Repository'', a publication in [[Hudson, New York]], in which an answer was provided to the question, "What is a cocktail?". It replied:

{{quote|''Cock-tail'' is a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and [[bitters]]—it is vulgarly called ''bittered sling'', and is supposed to be an excellent electioneering potion, inasmuch as it renders the heart stout and bold, at the same time that it fuddles the head. It is said, also to be of great use to a [[United States Democratic-Republican Party|democratic]] candidate: because a person, having swallowed a glass of it, is ready to swallow any thing else.<ref>[http://www.imbibemagazine.com/images/Balance_5-13-1806.pdf ''The Balance and Columbian Repository''], May 13, 1806, No. 19, Vol. V, page 146</ref>}}

The first publication of a [[bartender]]s' guide which included cocktail recipes was in 1862 — ''How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion'', by "Professor" [[Jerry Thomas (bartender)|Jerry Thomas]]. In addition to listings of recipes for Punches, Sours, Slings, Cobblers, Shrubs, Toddies, Flips, and a variety of other types of mixed drinks were 10 recipes for drinks referred to as "Cocktails". A key ingredient which differentiated "cocktails" from other drinks in this compendium was the use of [[bitters]] as an ingredient.

The first "cocktail party" ever thrown was allegedly by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], in May 1917.  Mrs. Walsh invited 50 guests to her home at noon on a Sunday. The party lasted an hour, until lunch was served at 1 pm.  The site of this first cocktail party still stands. In 1924, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis]] bought the Walsh mansion at 4510 Lindell Boulevard, and it has served as the local archbishop's residence ever since.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119161653517750477.html | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | title=St. Louis -- Party Central | first=Eric | last=Felten | date=October 6, 2007}}</ref>

During [[Prohibition in the United States]] (1919–1933), when alcoholic beverages were illegal, cocktails were still consumed illegally in establishments known as [[speakeasy|speakeasies]]. The quality of liquor available during Prohibition was much worse than previously.<ref name=Regan /> There was a shift from [[whiskey]] to [[gin]], which does not require aging and is therefore easier to produce illicitly.<ref>{{cite news|title=Celebrating Cinco de Drinko|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 28, 2008|author=Eric Felton}}</ref>  Honey, fruit juices, and other flavorings served to mask the foul taste of the inferior liquors.  Sweet cocktails were easier to drink quickly, an important consideration when the establishment might be raided at any moment.

Cocktails became less popular in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, until resurging in the 1980s with [[vodka]] often substituting the original gin in drinks such as the [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]]. Traditional cocktails and gin began to make a comeback in the 2000s.<ref>{{cite book

In September 2005, archaeochemist Patrick McGovern of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] announced the discovery of 5,000-year-old Mesopotamian earthenware from the banks of the Tigris between Iran and Iraq containing traces of tartaric acid, honey, apple juice and barley. McGovern described this early cocktail as "[[grog]]".

The word ''cocktail'' is sometimes used figuratively for a mixture of liquids or other substances.  Such a use might be, for example: "120 years of industry have dosed the area's soil with a noxious cocktail of heavy metals and chemical contaminants."

A makeshift incendiary bomb consisting of a bottle of flammable liquid (usually gasoline) with a flaming rag attached is known as a "[[Molotov cocktail]]".

Combinations of [[antiretroviral drug]]s used as [[HIV/AIDS]] therapy are frequently referred to "drug cocktails" or "AIDS cocktails."<ref>http://www.aliveandwell.org/html/aids_drug_fact/aidsdrugfact.html; http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/aids/2001-11-06-aids-johnson.htm</ref>
