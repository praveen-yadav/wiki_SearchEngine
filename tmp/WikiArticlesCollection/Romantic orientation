'''Affectional orientation''', informally called '''romantic orientation''', indicates the kind of person (based on [[gender]] or [[sex]]) with whom a person is most likely to [[Falling in love|fall in love]].<ref>Crethar, H. C. & Vargas, L. A. (2007). ''Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling.'' In J. Gregoire & C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor’s companion: What every amateur counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. ISBN 0-8058-5684-6. p.61.</ref> Although a [[bisexual]] person may feel sexually attracted to men and women, they may be predisposed to emotional intimacy with certain [[Gender identity|genders]]. Moreover, emotional intimacy between partners does not require [[sexual attraction]] because attraction is not purely sexual. For some people, [[sexual orientation]] is reductionistic.

For [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, affectional orientation can be a more useful measure of attraction than [[sexual orientation]].

It is a common term and part of every day conversation on the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) forums. Many members will refer to themselves as "[romantic orientation] asexuals."<ref>http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Affectional_orientation.html
