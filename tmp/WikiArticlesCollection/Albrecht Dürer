'''Albrecht Dürer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈalbʁɛçt ˈdyːʁɐ|lang}}; 21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528)<ref name=Mueller>Müller, Peter O. (1993) ''Substantiv-Derivation in Den Schriften Albrecht Dürers'', Walter de Gruyter. ISBN 3-11-012815-2.</ref> was a [[Germans|German]] painter, [[engraving|engraver]], [[printmaker]], [[mathematician]], and [[theorist]] from [[Nuremberg]]. His high-quality [[woodcut]]s (nowadays often called ''Meisterstiche'' or "[[old master print|master prints]]") established his reputation and influence across [[Europe]] when he was still in his twenties, and he has been conventionally regarded as the greatest artist of the [[Northern Renaissance]] ever since. His vast body of work includes altarpieces, religious works, numerous portraits and self-portraits, and copper engravings. The woodcuts, such as the ''[[Apocalypse (Dürer)|Apocalypse]]'' series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known prints include the ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513), ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|Saint Jerome in his Study]]'' (1514) and ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His [[watercolours]] also mark him as one of the first European [[landscape art]]ists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. 

Dürer's introduction of [[Roman mythology|classical motifs]] into Northern art, through his knowledge of [[Italian Renaissance|Italian artists]] and [[Humanism in Germany|German humanists]], has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, [[linear perspective|perspective]] and [[body proportions|ideal proportions]].

==Early life (1471–90)==

Dürer was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had between fourteen and eighteen children. His father, [[Albrecht Dürer the Elder]], was a successful [[goldsmith]], originally named Ajtósi, who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from [[Ajtós]], near [[Gyula (town)|Gyula]] in [[Hungary]].<ref name="heaton">{{Cite document|title=The Life of Albrecht Dürer of Nürnberg: With a Translation of His Letters and Journal and an Account of His Works|first=Mrs. Charles|last=Heaton|publisher=Seeley, Jackson and Halliday|year=1881|page=29|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=netZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA29|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}.</ref> The German name "Dürer" is a translation from the Hungarian, "Ajtósi".<ref name="heaton"/> Initially, it was "Türer," meaning doormaker, which is "ajtós" in Hungarian (from "ajtó", meaning door). A door is featured in the [[coat-of-arms]] the family acquired. Albrecht Dürer the Younger later changed "Türer", his father's diction of the family's surname, to "Dürer", to adapt to the local Nuremberg dialect. Albrecht Dürer the Elder married Barbara Holper, the daughter of his master, when he himself became a master in 1467.<ref>Bartrum, 93, note 1</ref>

Dürer's godfather was [[Anton Koberger]], who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of Dürer's birth and quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four [[printing-press]]es and having many offices in Germany and abroad. Koberger's most famous publication was the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', published in 1493 in German and Latin editions. It contained an unprecedented 1,809 [[woodcut]] illustrations (albeit with many repeated uses of the same block) by the [[Wolgemut]] workshop. Dürer may well have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.<ref name="Bartrum">Giulia Bartrum, "Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy", British Museum Press, 2002, ISBN 0-7141-2633-0</ref>

Because Dürer left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented by several sources. After a few years of school, Dürer started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father. Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to [[Michael Wolgemut]] at the age of fifteen in 1486. A self-portrait, a drawing in [[silverpoint]], is dated 1484 ([[Albertina, Vienna]]) “when I was a child," as his later inscription says. Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with Italy, especially [[Venice]], a relatively short distance across the [[Alps]].<ref name="Bartrum"/>

==''Wanderjahre'' and marriage (1490–94)==
After completing his term of apprenticeship, Dürer followed the common German custom of taking ''[[Wanderjahre]]''—in effect [[gap year]]s —in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; Dürer was to spend about four years away.  He left in 1490, possibly to work under [[Martin Schongauer]], the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before Dürer's arrival at [[Colmar]] in 1492. It is unclear  where Dürer travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In Colmar, Dürer was welcomed by Schongauer's brothers, the goldsmiths Caspar and Paul and the painter Ludwig. In 1493 Dürer went to [[Strasbourg]], where he would have experienced the sculpture of [[Nikolaus Gerhaert]]. Dürer's first painted self-portrait (now in the [[Louvre]]) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fiancée in Nuremberg.<ref name="Bartrum"/>

In early 1492 Dürer travelled to [[Basel]] to stay with another brother of Martin Schongauer, the goldsmith Georg.<ref>Here he produced a woodcut of [[St Jerome]] as a frontispiece for Nicholaus Kessler's 'Epistolare beati Hieronymi'. Panofsky argues that this print combined the '[[Ulm]]ian style' of Koberger's 'Lives of the Saints' (1488) and that of Wolgemut's workshop.  Panofsky:21</ref>  Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23, Dürer was married to Agnes Frey following an arrangement made during his absence. Agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city. However, no children resulted from the marriage.

==First journey to Italy (1494–95)==
[[Image:Durer Young Hare.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[Young Hare]]'', 1502, Watercolour and bodycolour ([[Albertina, Vienna]]).]]
Within three months of his marriage, Dürer left for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of [[Black Death|plague]] in Nuremberg. He made watercolour sketches as he traveled over the Alps. Some have survived and others may be deduced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving ''Nemesis''. 

In Italy, he went to Venice to study its more advanced artistic world.<ref name=Lee>Lee, Raymond L. & Alistair B. Fraser. (2001) ''The Rainbow Bridge'', Penn State Press. ISBN 0-271-01977-8.</ref>  Through Wolgemut's tutelage, Dürer had learned how to make prints in [[drypoint]] and design [[woodcut]]s in the German style, based on the works of [[Martin Schongauer]] and the [[Housebook Master]].<ref name=Lee /> He also would have had access to some Italian works in Germany, but the two visits he made to Italy had an enormous influence on him. He wrote that [[Giovanni Bellini]] was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice. His drawings and engravings show the influence of others, notably [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]] with his interest in the proportions of the body, Mantegna, [[Lorenzo di Credi]] and others. Dürer probably also visited [[Padua, Italy|Padua]] and [[Mantua]] on this trip.<ref>The evidence for this trip is not conclusive; the suggestion it happened is supported by Erwin Panofsky (in his Albrecht Dürer, 1943) and others, but it has been disputed by other scholars, including Katherine Crawford Luber (in her Albrecht Dürer and the Venetian Renaissance, 2005).</ref>

==Return to Nuremberg (1495–1505)==
[[Image:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514), engraving.]]

On his return to [[Nuremberg]] in 1495, Dürer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Dürer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513.<ref name=Allen>Allen, L. Jessie. (1903) ''Albrecht Dürer'', Methuen & co.</ref> His best works in the first years of the workshop were his [[woodcut]] prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as ''The Men's Bath House'' (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely-cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.

It is now thought unlikely that Dürer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Dürer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

His famous series of sixteen great designs for the ''Apocalypse<ref>[http://www.payer.de/christentum/apokalypse.htm Johannesapokalypse in klassischen Comics]</ref>'' is dated 1498, as is his engraving of'' [[St. Michael Fighting the Dragon-Albrecht Durer|St. Michael Fighting the Dragon]]''. He made the first seven scenes of the ''Great Passion'' in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the [[Holy Family]] and saints. The ''[[Polyptych of the Seven Sorrows|Seven Sorrows Polyptych]]'', commissioned by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III of Saxony]] in 1496, was executed by Dürer and his assistants c. 1500. Around 1503–1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the ''Great Passion,'' were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.<ref name="Bartrum"/>

During the same period Dürer trained himself in the difficult art of using the [[Burin (tool)|burin]] to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the ''Prodigal Son'', which the Italian Renaissance art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably ''Nemesis'' (1502), ''The Sea Monster'' (1498), and ''Saint Eustace'' (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as ''Pond in the Woods'' and ''Willow Mill'', are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. 
He made a number of [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]s, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made Dürer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.<ref name="Bartrum"/>
[[File:Dürer Oswolt Krel.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Oswolt Krel, a merchant from [[Lindau]] ([[Lake Constance]]), participating in the South German medieval trade corporation Große [[Ravensburg]]er Handelsgesellschaft, 1499.]]
The Venetian artist [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], whom Dürer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and Dürer said that he learned much about the new developments in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[anatomy]], and [[Body proportions|proportion]] from him. De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so Dürer began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show Dürer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of ''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'' (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces.<ref name="Bartrum"/> This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.

Dürer made large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the ''[[Betende Hände]]'' (English: ''Praying Hands'', c. 1508 [[Albertina, Vienna]]), a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece. He also continued to make images in watercolour and [[bodycolour]] (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his ''[[Young Hare]]'' (1502) and the ''[[Great Piece of Turf]]'' (1503, both also Albertina).

==Second journey to Italy (1505–1507)==
[[Image:Praying Hands - Albrecht Durer.png|180px|thumb|right|''[[Praying Hands (Dürer)|Praying Hands]]'', a pen-and-ink drawing made circa 1508]]
In Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in [[tempera]] on [[linen]].  These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the [[Paumgartner altarpiece]] and the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Dürer)|Adoration of the Magi]]''. In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507.<ref name=Mueller />  By this time Dürer's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of [[San Bartolomeo, Venice|San Bartolomeo]].  This was the altar-piece known as the ''[[Feast of the Rosary|Adoration of the Virgin]]'' or the ''Feast of Rose Garlands''.  It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence. It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and taken to Prague. Other paintings Dürer produced in Venice include ''The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch'', ''[[Christ Disputing with the Doctors]]'' (supposedly produced in a mere five days), and a number of smaller works.

==Nuremberg and the masterworks (1507–1520)==
Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, Dürer returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and — mainly through [[Lorenzo di Credi]] — [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

[[Image:Durer Adam and Eve.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'' (1507).]]

Between 1507 and 1511 Dürer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: ''Adam and Eve'' (1507), ''[[The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand (Dürer)|The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand]]'' (1508, for Frederick of Saxony), ''Virgin with the Iris'' (1508), the altarpiece ''Assumption of the Virgin'' (1509, for Jacob Heller of Frankfurt), and ''[[Adoration of the Trinity]]'' (1511, for Matthaeus Landauer). During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin, both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series. The post-Venetian woodcuts show Dürer's development of [[chiaroscuro]] modelling effects,<ref>Panofsky:135</ref> creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.
[[File:Duerer (Marter der zehntausend Christen).jpg|thumb|Self-portrait, 1508]]
Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516. However, in 1513 and 1514 Dürer created his three most famous [[engraving]]s: ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513, probably based on [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]'s treatise ''[[Enchiridion militis Christiani]]''), ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|St. Jerome in his Study]]'', and the much-debated ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (both 1514).

In 1515, he created his ''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros|woodcut of a Rhinoceros]]'' which had arrived in [[Lisbon]] from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself. An image of the [[Indian rhinoceros]], the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century.<ref name="Bartrum"/> In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515<ref>[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/durer.htm Dürer’s hemispheres of 1515 — the first European printed star charts]</ref> and portraits in [[tempera]] on [[linen]] in 1516.

===Patronage of Maximilian I===
From 1512, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] became Dürer's major patron. His commissions included ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'', a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by Pirckheimer's translation of [[Horapollo]]'s ''Hieroglyphica''. The design program and explanations were devised by [[Johannes Stabius]], the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter Jörg Kölderer and the woodcutting itself by Hieronymous Andreae, with Dürer as designer-in-chief. The Arch was followed by "[[The Triumphal Procession]]", the program of which was worked out in 1512 by [[:de:Marx Treitzsaurwein|Marx Treitz-Saurwein]] and includes woodcuts by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and [[Hans Springinklee]], as well as Dürer.

Dürer worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in [[lithography]]. Dürer's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Hans Baldung]]. Dürer also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before Maximilian's death in 1519.

==Journey to the Netherlands (1520–21)==
[[File:St. Cristopher-Dürer.jpg|right|thumb|St. Christopher, [[engraving]], 1521, by Albrecht Dürer]]

Maximilian's sudden death came at a time when Dürer was concerned he was losing "my sight and freedom of hand" (perhaps caused by [[arthritis]]) and increasingly affected by the writings of [[Martin Luther]].<ref>Bartrum, 204. Quotation from a letter to the secretary of the Elector of Saxony</ref>   In July 1520 Dürer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who was to be crowned at [[Aachen]]. Dürer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the [[Rhine]] to [[Cologne]] and then to [[Antwerp]], where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in [[silverpoint]], chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of [[Stefan Lochner]]), [[Nijmegen]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Bruges]] (where he saw [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Madonna of Bruges]]), [[Ghent]] (where he admired [[Jan van Eyck|van Eyck]]'s altarpiece), and [[Zeeland]].

Dürer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much.  This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time.  Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented.<ref>Landau & Parshall:350-54 and ''passim''</ref>  While providing valuable documentary evidence, Dürer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, Dürer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, [[Margaret of Habsburg (1480–1530)|Margaret of Austria]], but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met [[Bernard van Orley]], [[Jean Prévost]], [[Gerard Horenbout]], [[Jean Mone]], [[Joachim Patinir]] and [[Tommaso Vincidor]], though he did not, it seems, meet [[Quentin Matsys]].<ref>Panofsky:209</ref>

At the request of [[Christian II of Denmark]], Dürer went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait. There he saw "the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land"—the [[Aztec]] treasure that [[Hernán Cortés]] had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico. Dürer wrote that this treasure "was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins".<ref name="Bartrum"/>  Dürer also appears to have been collecting for his own [[cabinet of curiosities]], and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].

Having secured his pension, Dürer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness—perhaps [[malaria]]<ref>Panofsky:</ref> —which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.<ref name="Bartrum"/>

==Final years in Nuremberg (1521–28)==
On his return to Nuremberg, Dürer worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a [[Sacra conversazione|Sacra Conversazione]], though neither was completed.<ref>Panofsky:223</ref> This may have been due in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the [[body proportions|proportions]] of men and horses, and [[fortification]].

[[Image:Dürer Salvator Mundi detail.jpg|thumb|left|This detail from ''Salvator Mundi'', an unfinished oil painting on wood, reveals Dürer's highly detailed preparatory drawing. ''See [[:Image:Albrecht Dürer 100.jpg|full painting]]'']]
However, one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life, Dürer produced comparatively little as an artist. In painting, there was only a portrait of [[commons:File:Albrecht Dürer 078.jpg|Hieronymus Holtzschuher]], a [[commons:Image:Albrecht Dürer 061.jpg|''Madonna and Child'' (1526)]], [[commons:Image:Albrecht dürer salvator mundi.JPG|''Salvator Mundi '' (1526)]], and two panels showing [[John the Apostle|St. John]] with [[St. Peter]] in [[commons:Image:Albrecht Dürer 026.jpg|background]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] with [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] in the [[commons:Image:Albrecht Dürer 027.jpg|background]]. This last great work, [[the Four Apostles]], was given by Dürer to the City of Nuremberg—although he was given 100 guilders in return.<ref name="Panofsky"/> An inscription relates the figures to the [[four humours]].<ref>Panofsky:235</ref>

As for engravings, Dürer's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise. The portraits include Cardinal-Elector [[Albert of Mainz]]; [[Frederick the Wise]], elector of Saxony; the [[Humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Willibald Pirckheimer]]; [[Philipp Melanchthon]], and [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]]. For those of [[Albert of Mainz|the Cardinal]], Melanchthon, and Dürer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Dürer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.

Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Dürer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend [[Willibald Pirckheimer]], whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images.<ref>Corine Schleif (2010), “Albrecht Dürer between Agnes Frey and Willibald Pirckheimer,” ''The Essential Dürer'', ed. Larry Silver and [[Jeffrey Chipps Smith]], Philadelphia, 85-205</ref> He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Dürer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. "The Four Books on Measurement" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on [[mathematics]] in German,<ref name="Bartrum"/> as well as being cited later by [[Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. "The Four Books on Human Proportion" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.<ref name=Mueller />

Dürer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins—a considerable sum. [[Albrecht Dürer's House|His large house]] (purchased in 1509 from the heirs of the astronomer [[Bernhard Walther]]), where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 1539, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark.<ref name="Bartrum"/> It is now a museum. He is buried in the ''Johannisfriedhof'' cemetery.

===Dürer and the Reformation===
[[Image:Nürnberger Feldschlange.JPG|thumb|right|''The Cannon'', Dürer's largest etching, 1518]]

Dürer's writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to [[Martin Luther]]'s ideas, though it is unclear if he ever left the Catholic Church. Dürer wrote of his desire to draw Luther in his diary in 1520: "And God help me that I may go to Dr. Martin Luther; thus I intend to make a portrait of him with great care and engrave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the Christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties."<ref>Price (2003), 225</ref>  In a letter to [[Nicholas Kratzer]] in 1524, Dürer wrote "because of our Christian faith we have to stand in scorn and danger, for we are reviled and called heretics." Most tellingly, Pirckheimer wrote in a letter to Johann Tscherte in 1530: "I confess that in the beginning I believed in Luther, like our Albert of blessed memory...but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse." Dürer may even have contributed to the Nuremberg City Council's mandating Lutheran sermons and services in March 1525. Notably, Dürer had contacts with various reformers, such as [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] and Cornelius Grapheus from whom Dürer received Luther's 'Babylonian Captivity' in 1520.<ref>Price:225-248</ref> 

Dürer's later works have also been claimed to show [[Protestant]] sympathies. For example, his engraving of ''[[The Last Supper]]'' of 1523 has often been understood to have an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] theme, focussing as it does on Christ espousing the [[Gospel]], as well the inclusion of the [[Eucharist]]ic cup, an expression of Protestant [[Utraquist|utraquism]],<ref>Strauss, 1981</ref> although this interpretation has been questioned.<ref>Price:254</ref> The delaying of the engraving of [[Philip the Apostle|St Philip]], completed in 1523 but not distributed until 1526, may have been due to Dürer's uneasiness with images of Saints; even if Dürer was not an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]], in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion.<ref>Harbison</ref>

==Legacy and influence==
[[Image:Dürer - Rhinoceros.jpg|thumb|''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros]]'', [[Drawing|Ink drawing]] on paper, 1515.]]
Dürer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominately in private collections located in only a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], and [[Parmigianino]], all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work. 

His work in [[engraving]] seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the "[[Little Masters]]" who attempted few large engravings but continued Dürer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. [[Lucas van Leyden]] was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Dürer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds ([[Giulio Campagnola]] and Christofano Robetta), or whole prints ([[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and [[Agostino Veneziano]]). However, Dürer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.

In painting, Dürer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Dürer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the ''Dürer Renaissance'' of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German [[nationalism]] from 1870 to 1945.<ref name="Bartrum"/>

Dürer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by [[D'Arcy Thompson]] in his book ''On Growth and Form''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thompson, D'Arcy|year=1917|title=On Growth and Form|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=290–292}}</ref>

==Theoretical works==
In all his theoretical works, in order to communicate his theories in the [[German language]] rather than in [[Latin]], Dürer used graphic expressions based on a [[vernacular]], craftsmen's language. For example, 'Schneckenlinie' ('snail-line') was his term for a spiral form. Thus, Dürer contributed to the expansion in German prose which [[Martin Luther]] had begun with his translation of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]].<ref name="Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky, "The Life and Art of Albrecht Dürer", Princeton, 1945, ISBN 0-691-00303-3</ref>

===''Four Books on Measurement''===
[[Image:AlbrechtDürer01.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Vier Bücher von menschlicher Proportion'' showing the monogram signature of Albrecht Dürer]]

Dürer's work on [[geometry]] is called the ''Four Books on Measurement'' (''Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt'' or ''Instructions for Measuring with Compass and Ruler'').<ref>A. Koyre, "The Exact Sciences", in ''The Beginnings of Modern Science'', edited by Rene Taton, translated by A. J. Pomerans</ref> The first book focuses on linear geometry. Dürer's geometric constructions include [[helices]], [[Conchoid (mathematics)|conchoids]] and [[epicycloid]]s. He also draws on [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]], and [[Johannes Werner]]'s 'Libellus super viginti duobus elementis conicis' of 1522. The second book moves onto two dimensional geometry, i.e. the construction of regular [[polygons]]. Here Dürer favours the methods of [[Ptolemy]] over [[Euclid]]. The third book applies these principles of geometry to [[architecture]], [[engineering]] and [[typography]]. In [[architecture]] Dürer cites [[Vitruvius]] but elaborates his own classical designs and [[classical orders|columns]]. In [[typography]], Dürer depicts the geometric construction of the [[Latin alphabet]], relying on [[History of western typography#Classical_revival|Italian precedent]]. However, his construction of the [[Gothic alphabet]] is based upon an entirely different [[modular]] system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second  by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of [[polyhedra]]. Here Dürer discusses the five [[Platonic solid]]s, as well as seven [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Dürer shows the objects as [[Net (polyhedron)|nets]]. Finally, Dürer discusses the [[Doubling the cube|Delian Problem]]  and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through [[linear perspective]]. It was in [[Bologna]] that Dürer was taught (possibly by [[Luca Pacioli]] or [[Bramante]]) the principles of [[linear perspective]], and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of [[Piero della Francesca]]. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Although Dürer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles.  In addition to these geometrical constructions, Dürer discusses in this last book of ''Underweysung der Messung'' an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

===''Four Books on Human Proportion''===
[[File:Durer foot.jpg|thumb|Dürer often used [[multiview orthographic projection]]s]]
Dürer's work on [[body proportions|human proportions]] is called the ''Four Books on Human Proportion'' (''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion'') of 1528. The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height. Dürer based these constructions on both [[Vitruvius]] and empirical observations of, "two to three hundred living persons,"<ref name="Panofsky"/>  in his own words. The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an [[Leone Battista Alberti|Albertian]] system, which Dürer probably learned from [[Francesco di Giorgio]]'s 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525. In the third book, Dürer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of [[convex mirror|convex]] and [[concave mirror]]s; here Dürer also deals with human [[physiognomy]]. The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.

Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Dürer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. Dürer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, Dürer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naïve approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Dürer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Dürer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or [[artistic inspiration|inspired]] to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'.<ref name="Panofsky"/> In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. Dürer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that "one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year."<ref>Panofsky:283</ref>
