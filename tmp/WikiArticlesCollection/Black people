In the first 200 years that black people were in the [[United States]], they commonly referred to themselves as Africans. In Africa, people primarily identified themselves by ethnic group (closely allied to language) and not by skin color. Individuals identified as [[The Ashanti|Ashanti]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Kongo people|Bakongo]], or [[Wolof people|Wolof]]. But when Africans were brought to [[the Americas]], they were often combined with other groups from Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as Africans came from a vast geographic region: the [[West Africa]]n coastline stretching from [[Senegal]] to [[Angola]] and in some cases from the south-east coast such as [[Mozambique]]. A new identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the [[Black church]] and [[AAVE|Black English]]. This new identity was based on African ancestry and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group.<ref name=Shahadah>{{cite web| last = Shahadah| first = Owen 'Alik| authorlink =Owen 'Alik Shahadah| title =Linguistics for a new African reality| url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm}}</ref> By contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books/about/Africans_in_Colonial_Louisiana.html?id=Arybfb4UWtwC Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century''], Louisiana State University Press, 1992/1995</ref>

The US racial or ethnic classification "black" refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation, from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors, including [[albinos]], if they are believed by others to have African ancestry (in any discernible percentage), or to exhibit cultural traits associated with being "[[African American]]." As a result, in the United States the term "black people" is not an indicator of skin color but of socially based racial classification.<ref>{{Cite book |last =Glenn |first =Evelyn Nakano  |coauthor= |year = 2009|title =Shades of difference: why skin color matters |url =http://books.google.ca/books?id=WewhspE2Q9UC&lpg=PR1&dq=Shades%20of%20difference%3A%20why%20skin%20color%20matters&pg=PA225#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=225 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-5998-4|accessdate = |postscript =<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In March 1807, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], which largely controlled the Atlantic, declared [[Slave Trade Act 1807|the transatlantic slave trade illegal]], as did the United States. (The latter prohibition took effect 1 January 1808, the earliest date on which [[United States Congress|Congress]] had the power to do so after protecting the slave trade under [[wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Section 9|Article I, Section 9]] of the [[United States Constitution]].)

By that time, the majority of black people in the United States were native-born, so the use of the term "African" became problematic. Though initially a source of pride, many blacks feared the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US. They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa. In 1835, black leaders called upon black Americans to remove the title of "African" from their institutions and replace it with "[[Negro]]" or "Colored American". A few institutions chose to keep their historic names, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. African Americans popularly used the terms "Negro" or "colored" for themselves until the late 1960s.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1594200831/ ''African American Journeys to Africa''], pp. 63-64</ref>

The term ''black'' was used throughout but not frequently since it carried a certain stigma.
In his 1963 "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech,<ref>{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1732754907698549493 | people = Martin Luther King, Jr.| title = I Have a Dream| medium = Google Video| location = Washington, D.C.|date=28 August 1963 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}</ref> [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] uses the terms ''negro'' fifteen times and ''black'' four times. Each time he uses ''black'' it is in parallel construction with ''white'', for example, "black men and white men."<ref>{{cite journal| last = Smith|first= Tom W.|title = Changing Racial Labels: From "Colored" to "Negro" to "Black" to "African American"| journal = The Public Opinion Quarterly| volume = 56| issue=4|pages = 496–514|oclc=192150485| url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/soc522a/PDF%20readings/Smith.pdf|date = Winter, 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| doi = 10.1086/269339|format=PDF}}</ref>

With the successes of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]], a new term was needed to break from the past and help shed the reminders of legalized discrimination. In place of ''Negro'', activists promoted the use of ''black'' as standing for racial pride, militancy, and power. Some of the turning points included the use of the term "[[Black Power]]" by Kwame Toure ([[Stokely Carmichael]]) and the popular singer [[James Brown]]'s song "[[Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud]]".
[[File:Jordan by Lipofsky 16577.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Jordan]], an African American considered by many to be the greatest basketball player in history.]]
In 1988, the civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]] urged Americans to use the term "African American" because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants, such as German American, Italian American, etc. Since then, African American and black have had essentially coequal status. Controversy continues over which term is more appropriate. [[Maulana Karenga]] and [[Owen Alik Shahadah]] argue African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates geographical and historical origin.<ref name="Shahadah"/> Others have argued that "black" is a better term because "African" suggests foreignness, although black people have been in the US since the earliest colonial years.<ref>{{cite news| last = McWhorter| first = John H.| title = Why I'm Black, Not African American| work= Los Angeles Times|date=8 September 2004| url = http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_latimes-why_im_black.htm| accessdate =26 September 2010}}</ref> Still others believe the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones.<ref name=Relethford2000>{{cite journal |last1=Relethford |first1=JH |title=Human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations |journal=Human Biology; an international record of research |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=773–80 |year=2000 |pmid=11126724}}</ref><ref name="Shriver2003">{{cite journal |pages=387–399 |doi=10.1007/s00439-002-0896-y |url=http://backintyme.com/admixture/shriver01.pdf | pmid=12579416 |volume=112 |issue=4 |title=Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry and admixture mapping |year=2003 |month=April |author=Shriver M.D., Parra E.J., Dios S., ''et al.'' |journal=Human Genetics}}</ref> Surveys show that the majority of black Americans have no preference for "African American" or "Black,"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx|title=Black or African American?|first=Frank|last=Newport|publisher=Gallup|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref> although they have a slight preference for "black" in personal settings and "African American" in more formal settings.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Miller| first1 = Pepper| last2 = Kemp|first2=Herb | title = What's Black About?

Increases in the number of black immigrants to the United States from [[African immigration to the United States|Africa]], the Caribbean, and Latin America since the late twentieth century have raised questions about who uses the term African American. The more recent African immigrants may sometimes view themselves, and be viewed, as culturally distinct from native-born Americans who descend from African slaves.<ref name="Swarns">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DB1F3EF93AA1575BC0A9629C8B63|title='African American' Becomes a Term for Debate|last=Swarns|first=Rachel L.|date=29 August 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=22 July 2008}}</ref>

The [[Race (United States Census)|U.S. census race definitions]] says a "black" is a person having origins in any of the black (sub-Saharan) racial groups of Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as "Black, African Am., or Negro" or who provide written entries such as African American, Afro-American, [[Kenyan]], [[Nigerian]], or [[Haiti]]an. The [[Census Bureau]] notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/mso/www/c2000basics/00Basics.pdf 2000 US Census basics]</ref>

A considerable portion of the [[U.S. population]] identified as ''black'' also has [[Europe]]an ancestry in varying amounts; a lesser proportion have some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry. For instance, genetic studies of African-American people show an ancestry that is on average 17–18% European.<ref>[http://www.isteve.com/2002_How_White_Are_Blacks.htm Steve Sailer, "How White Are Blacks? How Black Are Whites?"], iSteve, 2002.</ref>

===One-drop rule===

Since the late nineteenth century, the South used a [[colloquial]] term, the ''[[one-drop rule]]'', to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry. This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early twentieth century.<ref name=Davis>{{cite web| last = James| first = F. Davis| title = Who is Black? One Nation's Definition| url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/mixed/onedrop.html| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}</ref> Legally the definition varied from state to state. Racial definition was more flexible in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before the [[American Civil War]]. For instance, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held persons who were legally white (less than 25% black) according to Virginia law at the time, but, because they were born to slave mothers, they were born into slavery, according to the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', which Virginia adopted into law in 1662.

Outside of the US, some other countries have adopted the one-drop rule, but the definition of who is black and the extent to which the one-drop "rule" applies varies greatly from country to country.

The one-drop rule may have originated as a means of increasing the number of black slaves<ref>[[Clarence Page]], [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/page_5-1.html A Credit to His Races], ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', 1 May 1997.</ref> and was maintained as an attempt to keep the white race pure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://backintyme.com/essays/?p=25|title=Presenting the Triumph of the One-Drop Rule|last=Sweet|first=Frank|date=1 April 2006|work=The One-Drop Rule|accessdate=22 July 2008}}</ref> One of the results of the one-drop rule was the uniting of the African-American community.<ref name=Davis/> Some of the most prominent abolitionists and civil-rights activists of the nineteenth century were multiracial, such as [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Robert Purvis]], and [[James Mercer Langston]]. They advocated equality for all.

The concept of blackness in the United States has been described{{By whom|date=June 2008}} as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream [[African American culture]] and values. To a certain extent, this concept is not so much about race but more about culture and behavior. Blackness can be contrasted with "[[acting white]]", where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to [[fashion]], [[dialect]], taste in [[music]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kent.edu/Magazine/Spring2007/ActingWhite.cfm|title=Acting White|last=Edler|first=Melissa|date=Spring 2007|work=Kent State Magazine|accessdate=22 July 2008}}</ref> and possibly, from the perspective of a significant number of black youth, academic achievement.<ref>Ogbu, J. "Black American students in an affluent suburb: a study of academic disengagement". Erlbaum Associates Press. Mahwah, NJ. 2003.</ref>

The notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. [[Toni Morrison]] once described [[Bill Clinton]] as the first black [[President of the United States]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/int/2002/02/20/clinton/index.html|title=Blacks and Bill Clinton |last=Hansen |first=Suzy |date=20 February 2002 |work=Salon |accessdate=22 July 2008}}</ref> because of his warm relations with African Americans{{cn|date=August 2013}} and his poor upbringing.{{cn|date=August 2013}} [[Christopher Hitchens]] was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president, noting, "Mr Clinton, according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is our first black President, the first to come from the broken home, the alcoholic mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems. Thus, we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism, but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms: broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits and (presumable from the rest of [Arthur] Miller's senescent musings) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/apr/18/clinton.usa|title=Is he the most crooked President in history?|date=18 April 1999|work=The Guardian|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> Some black activists were also offended, claiming Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before, while not serving black interests.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1637/is_200204/ai_n6880693 | title=Find Articles 404 File not found}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> They note his lack of action during the [[Rwanda genocide]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/mar/31/usa.rwanda|title=US chose to ignore Rwandan genocide|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=31 March 2004|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 July 2008 | location=London}}</ref> and his [[welfare reform]], which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst [[child poverty]] since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/jun1999/welf-j02.shtml|title=Clinton's welfare reform has increased child poverty|last=Roberts |first=Larry|date=2 June 1999|publisher=World Socialist Web Site|accessdate=22 July 2008}}</ref> Others noted that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/gray1207.html|title=Soul Brother?

The question of blackness also arose in the Democrat [[Barack Obama]]'s [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]]. Commentators have questioned whether Obama, who was elected the first President with black ancestry, is "black enough," contending that his background is not typical because his mother was [[white American]], and his father was a black [[Kenyan American|Kenyan immigrant]].<ref name=obama-speech/><ref name=obama-time/> Obama chose to identify as black and [[African-American]].<ref name=Kroft>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/11/60minutes/main2458530.shtml|title=A Transcript Excerpt Of Steve Kroft’s Interview With Sen.

In July 2012, Ancestry.com reported on historic and [[DNA]] research by its staff that discovered that Obama is likely a descendant through his mother of [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], considered by some historians to be the first African slave in the [[Virginia]] colony. An [[indentured servant]], he was "bound for life" in 1640 after trying to escape. The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women, likely indentured servants and working class like them. Their [[multi-racial]] children were free because they were born to free [[English people|English]] women. Over time, Obama's line of the Bunch family (as they became known) were property owners and continued to "marry white"; they became part of white society, likely by the early to mid-eighteenth century.<ref name="Harman">[http://c.mfcreative.com/offer/us/obama_bunch/PDF/main_article_final.pdf Anastasia Harman, Natalie D.

The topic of race in Brazil is complex. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Between a pure black and a very light mulatto, more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged, based on combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race has referred to appearance, not heredity.<ref name="skidmore">{{cite journal| first = Thomas E. | last = Skidmore | title = Fact and Myth: Discovering a Racial Problem in Brazil| journal = Working Paper| volume = 173|url=http://www.nd.edu/~kellogg/publications/workingpapers/WPS/173.pdf| month = April | year = 1992|format=PDF}}</ref>

Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil. It is generally believed that upward mobility and education results in reclassification of individuals into lighter-skinned categories. The popular claim is that in Brazil, poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white. Some scholars disagree, arguing that whitening of one's social status may be open to people of mixed race, but a typically black person will consistently be identified as black regardless of wealth or social status.<ref name=Telles>{{cite book| last = Edward E. | first = Telles| title = Race in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil| pages = 95–98| publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| year=  2004| isbn =0-691-11866-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| first = Edward E. | last = Telles| title = Racial Ambiguity Among the Brazilian Population| journal = Ethnic and Racial Studies|url=http://www.ccpr.ucla.edu/ccprwpseries/ccpr_012_01.pdf| volume = 25| pages = 415–441| date=  3 May 2002| publisher = California Center for Population Research| doi = 10.1080/01419870252932133|format=PDF| issue = 3}}</ref>

From the year 1500 to 1850, an estimated 3.5 million Africans were forcibly shipped to Brazil.<ref name=Telles/> It is estimated that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descendants of these Africans. Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa. In contrast to the US, there were no segregation or anti-[[miscegenation]] laws in Brazil. Intermarriage has been popular for centuries. Much of the white/Asian population also has either African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census of the twentieth century, 54% identified themselves as white, 6.2% identified themselves as black, and 39.5% identified themselves as [[Pardo]] (brown)&nbsp;— a broad multi-racial category.<ref>{{cite web| title = CIA World Factbook: Brazil| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html}}</ref>

A philosophy of [[Racial whitening|whitening]] emerged in Brazil in the nineteenth century. Until recently the government did not keep data on race. However, statisticians estimate that in 1835 half the population was black, one fifth was Pardo (brown) and one fourth white. By 2000, the black population had fallen to 6.2%, the Pardo had increased to 40%, and white to 55%. Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing.<ref name="skidmore"/> A 2007 study found that at least 29% of the middle-class, white Brazilian population had some recent (since the colonial period) African ancestry.<ref>[http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2007/vol2-6/gmr0330_full_text.htm "Sex-biased gene flow in African Americans but not in American Caucasians"], ''GMR,'' 2007, Vol. 12 No. 6</ref>

====Race relations in Brazil====
[[File:Filhas-de-santo moradoras do terreiro.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Afro-Brazilian women during a [[Candomblé]] ceremony]]
Because of the ideology of [[miscegenation]], Brazil has avoided the polarization of society into black and white. The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that divide the US are notably absent in Brazil. According to the 2010 census, 6.7% of Brazilians said they were black, compared with 6.2% in 2000, and 43.1% said they were mixed race, up from 38.5%. In 2010, Elio Ferreira de Araujo, Brazil's minister for racial equality, attributed the change to growing pride among his country's black and indigenous communities.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/25/brazil-2010-census-kalunga "Brazil's census offers recognition at last to descendants of runaway slaves"], ''Guardian''</ref>

The philosophy of the racial democracy in Brazil has drawn criticism from some quarters. Brazil has one of the largest gaps in income distribution in the world. The richest 10% of the population earn 28 times the average income of the bottom 40%. The richest 10 percent is almost exclusively white. One-third of the population lives under the poverty line, with blacks and other non-whites accounting for 70 percent of the poor.<ref>{{cite web| last = Barrolle| first = Melvin Kadiri| title = African 'Americans' in Brazil| publisher =New America Media| url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b8d531de860940110af2433244782c6| accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref>

In the US, black people earn 75% of what white people earn.<ref name=Phillips>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/17/brazil-census-african-brazilians-majority Tom Phillips, "Brazil census shows African-Brazilians in the majority for the first time"], ''The Guardian'', 17 November 2011</ref> In Brazil, non-whites earn less than 50% of what whites earn. Some have posited that Brazil practices the [[one-drop rule]] when analysts consider the facts of social and economic divisions. The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and non-whites. Other factors, such as illiteracy and education levels, show the same patterns.<ref>{{cite web| last = Roland| first = Edna Maria Santos| title = The Economics of Racism: People of African Descent in Brazil| url=http://www.falapreta.org.br/durban/racism.doc}}</ref>
Unlike in the US, where African Americans were united in the civil-rights struggle, in Brazil the philosophy of whitening has helped divide blacks from other non-whites and prevented a more active civil rights movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Though Brazilians of African heritage make up a large percentage<ref name=Phillips /> of the population there are very few black politicians. The city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], for instance, is 80% Afro-Brazilian but has never had a black mayor. Critics indicate that US cities that have a black majority, such as [[Detroit]] and [[New Orleans]], have never had white mayors since first electing black mayors in the 1970s.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/><ref>Charles Whitaker, "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n4_v46/ai_9329550/pg_3 Blacks in Brazil: The Myth and the Reality]," ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', February 1991.</ref>

Non-white people also have limited media visibility. The Latin American media, in particular the Brazilian media, has been accused of hiding its Black, Indigenous, Multiracial and East Asian population. For example the [[telenovelas]] or [[Soap Opera|soaps]] are said to be a hotbed of largely [[blond]] and [[Eye color|light-eyed]] [[white Brazilian|white]] (they resemble [[Scandinavia]]ns and other [[northern Europe]]ans more than they look like white Brazilians of typical [[Southern Europe]]an features) and [[White people#Brazil|light-skinned mulatto and mestizo]] (often deemed as white persons in Brazil if achieving the middle class or higher social status) actors. Most rare empowered persons of color represented in Latin American media possess typically Caucasian features due to a mix of racist standards of [[beauty]], [[colourism]] and [[lookism]]. Nevertheless, in the last years, the number of empowered afrodescendants (either economically or by other ways) increased in Brazilian media coverage. Despite Brazil also possessing [[criminal black man stereotype]]s, it is considered a huge prejudice and mostly not used in a disordered way by the media, in spite of sometimes common "humouristic" [[sexist joke]]s and [[LGBT stereotypes|LGBT stereotyping]] <ref name="Maria Berenice">{{pt icon}} [http://mariaberenice.com.br/pt/estereotipo-vexatorio-em-programas-humoristicos-e-homofobia--diz-maria-berenice.cont Vexing stereotypes in humouristic shows is homophobia, lawyer Maria Berenice says].

These patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some to advocate for the use of the Portuguese term 'negro' to encompass non-whites so as to renew a black consciousness and identity, in effect an African descent rule.<ref>[http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2006/brazil_separates_into_a_world_of_black_and_white "Brazil Separates Into a World of Black and White"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 3 September 2006.</ref> It generates criticism since [[Pardo]], or [[Brown people]], is intended to include [[caboclo]]s (mestizos), assimilated Amerindians and tri-racials, not only afrodescendants&nbsp;— thus Brazilian of some or no recent African descent, as most White Brazilians, become 60–70% of the population, breaking the argument of possible Brazilian one-drop rule since real noticeable mulattoes, [[cafuzo]]s (zambos) and black persons are a minority and the Brazilian poor represents larger percents in Brazil. As one would expect from an underdeveloped country, there are pockets of poverty in White-majority and [[Japanese Brazilian]]-majority areas, rarer in urban developments but common in rural areas. They are even more common among Mestizo-majority areas, and Amerindian communities.

===South Africa===

[[Image:Nelson Mandela.jpg|thumb|[[Nelson Mandela]] led the [[ANC]] in the battle against South African Apartheid.]]

In [[South Africa]] during the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]], beginning in the first half of the twentieth century, the population was classified into four main racial groups: ''Black'', ''White'', ''[[Asia]]n'' (mostly [[India]]n), and ''[[Coloured]]''. <!--These terms are capitalized to denote their legal definitions in South African law.--> The Coloured group included people of mixed [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Khoisan]], and [[European ethnic groups|European]] descent (with some [[Cape Malays|Malay]] ancestry, especially in the [[Western Cape]]). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa.

The [[apartheid]] bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria in the [[Population Registration Act]] of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group. Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications. When it was unclear from a person's physical appearance whether a person was to be considered Colored or Black, the "pencil test" was employed. This involved inserting a pencil in a person's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough for the pencil to get stuck. If so, the person was classified as Black.<ref>{{cite news | last = Nullis| first = Clare | title = Township tourism booming in South Africa| publisher = The Associated Press| year=  2007| url = http://www.canada.com/topics/travel/features/story.html?id=59ec6285-c9fb-41ab-93f9-419f62733f07&k=67896}}</ref>

During the apartheid era, those classed as "Coloured" were oppressed and discriminated against. But, they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as "Black".

In the post-apartheid era, the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a 'Non-racial democracy". However, the ANC government has introduced laws in support of their [[affirmative action]] policies that define "Black" people to include "Africans", "Coloureds" and "Asians". Their [[affirmative action]] policies have also favored "Africans" over "Coloureds". Some South Africans categorized as "African Black" openly state that "Coloureds" did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid. The popular saying by "Coloured" South Africans to illustrate their dilemma is:

{{quote|We were not white enough under apartheid, and we are not black enough under the ANC ([[African National Congress]])}}

In 2008, the High Court in South Africa ruled that [[Chinese South Africans]] who were residents during the apartheid era (and their descendents) are to be reclassified as "Black people" solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits, because they were also "disadvantaged" by racial discrimination. Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4168245.ece "We agree that you are black, South African court tells Chinese"], ''The Times''</ref>

Other than by appearance, "Coloureds" can usually be distinguished from "Blacks" by language. Most speak [[Afrikaans]] or English as a [[first language]], as opposed to [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] or [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]. They also tend to have more European-sounding names than Bantu names.<ref>{{cite news | last = du Preez| first = Max| title = Coloureds&nbsp;– the most authentic SA citizens| work= The Star|date=13 April 2006| url = http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3201857}}</ref>

In more recent times, about 1000 CE, interactions between black people and Arabs resulted in the incorporation of extensive Arabic vocabulary into [[Swahili language|Swahili]], which became a useful ''[[lingua franca]]'' for merchants. Some of this linguistic exchange occurred as part of the slave trade; the history of [[Islamic views on slavery|Islam and slavery]] shows that the [[Madh'hab|major juristic schools]] traditionally accepted the institution of [[slavery]].<ref name="Lewis">Lewis 1994, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html Ch.1]</ref> As a result, Arab influence spread along the [[Swahili Coast]] and to some extent into the interior of the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region (see [[Swahili people]]). [[Timbuktu]] was a trading outpost that linked [[West Africa]] with [[Berber people|Berber]], Arab, and Jewish traders throughout the [[Arab world]]. As a result of these interactions, there was extensive female-mediated gene flow into the [[Middle East]] from Sub-Saharan Africa in certain populations.<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1180338 "Extensive Female-Mediated Gene Flow from Sub-Saharan Africa into Near Eastern Arab Populations"], National Institutes of Health</ref>

According to Dr. Carlos Moore, resident scholar at Brazil's University of the State of Bahia, Afro-multiracials in the Arab world self-identify in ways that resemble [[Latin America]]. He claims that black-looking Arabs, much like black-looking [[Latin Americans]], consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry.<ref>{{cite web| last = Musselman| first = Anson | title = The Subtle Racism of Latin America| publisher = UCLA International Institute| url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=4125}}</ref>

Moore also claims that a film about [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Anwar Sadat]] had to be canceled when Sadat discovered that an [[African American]] had been cast to play him. But, the 1983 television movie ''[[Sadat (film)|Sadat]]'', starring [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]], was not canceled. Instead, the [[government of Egypt|Egyptian government]] refused to let the drama air in Egypt, partially on the grounds of the casting of Gossett.<ref>[http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Louis_Gossett_Jr/192411 Louis Gosset Jr.] Hollywood.com</ref>

Sadat's mother was a dark-skinned [[Sudan]]ese woman and his father was a lighter-skinned [[Egyptians|Egyptian]]. In response to an advertisement for an acting position, he said, "I am not white but I am not exactly black either. My blackness is tending to reddish".<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=PoW4pO4q9VwC&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 Joseph Finklestone, ''Anwar Sadat: Visionary Who Dared''], pp. 5–7, 31. ISBN 0-7146-3487-5</ref>

[[Fathia Nkrumah]] was another Egyptian with ties to Black Africa. She was the late wife of [[Ghana]]ian revolutionary [[Kwame Nkrumah]], whose marriage was seen as helping plant the seeds of cooperation between Egypt and other African countries as they struggled for independence from European colonization. This helped advance the formation of the [[African Union]].<ref>[http://ausummit-accra.org.gh/index1.php?linkid=289&adate=04%2F07%2F2007&archiveid=140&page=1 African Union Summit]</ref>
Because of the patriarchal nature of Arab society, Arab men enslaved more black women than men, and used more black female slaves than males. The men interpreted the [[Qur'an]] to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage (see [[Ma malakat aymanukum and sex]]),<ref>See [[Tahfeem ul Qur'an]] by [[Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], Vol. 2, pp. 112–113, footnote 44.

When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master's child, she became ''umm walad'' or “mother of a child”, a status that granted her privileged rights.

[[File:Aborigine.png|thumb|right|134px|Unknown [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] woman in 1911]]
[[Indigenous Australians]] have been referred to as "black people" in Australia since the [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|early days of European settlement]].<ref>http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/4219798</ref> While originally related to [[skin colour]], the term is used to today to indicate Aboriginal or [[Torres Strait Islander]] [[ancestry]] in general and can refer to autochthonous people of any skin pigmentation.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/aboriginal-identity-goes-beyond-skin-colour-20110406-1d40r.html</ref>

Being identified as either "black" or "white" in [[Australia]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one's employment and social prospects. Various state-based [[Aboriginal Protection Board]]s were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians - where they lived, their employment, marriage, education and included the power to separate children from their parents.<ref>{{cite book | last = Broome | first = Richard | title = Aboriginal Victorians: A History Since 1800 | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]] | year = 2005 | pages = 130–131 | isbn = 978-1-74114-569-4}}</ref><ref>[http://aeon.sro.wa.gov.au/Investigator/Details/Agency_Detail.asp?Id=1200 Aboriginal Protection Board at the ''State Records Office of Western Australia'', accessed 20 December 2012]</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-54.html |title=Aboriginal Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 (Qld) |publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy |accessdate=19/12/2012 }}</ref> Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/whole34.pdf |pages=1–24 |first=Heather |last=Goodall |title=Land In Our Own Country: The Aboriginal Land Rights Movement in South Eastern Australia, 1860 to 1914 |journal=Aboriginal History |volume=14 |year=1990 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/42696/2/Aborigines.pdf |first=Mick |last=Armstrong |title=Aborigines: Problems of Race and Class | year=2004 |accessdate=1/12/2012}}</ref> The social position of mixed-race or "[[half-caste]]" individuals varied over time. A 1913 report by Sir [[Walter Baldwin Spencer|Baldwin Spencer]] states that:
{{quote|the half-castes belong neither to the aboriginal nor to the whites, yet, on the whole, they have more leaning towards the former; ...

After the [[First World War]], however, it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population, and by 1930 fear of the "half-caste menace" undermining the [[White Australia Policy|White Australia]] ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/funding/awards/pmla/2012/first-chapters/Indifferent-inclusions-%28Chap1%29.pdf |title=Indifferent Inclusion: Aboriginal People and the Australian Nation |first=Russell |last=McGregor |publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press |year=2012 |chapter=1 |pages=1–5}}</ref> Dr. [[Cecil Cook (Australia)|Cecil Cook]], the [[Northern Territory]] [[Protector of Aborigines|Protector of Natives]], noted that:

The second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for Aborginal people. Aborigines were given the right to vote in 1962, and in the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]] over 90% of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national [[census]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Indigenous-Australia-Timeline-1901-to-1969 |title=Indigenous Australia Timeline - 1901 to 1969 |date=3 November 2011 |publisher=Australian Museum }}</ref> During this period many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term "black" and use their ancestry as a source of pride. Activist [[Bob Maza]] said:

In 1978 Aboriginal writer [[Kevin Gilbert (author)|Kevin Gilbert]] received the National Book Council award for his book ''Living Black: Blacks Talk to Kevin Gilbert'', a collection of Aboriginal people's stories, and in 1998 was awarded (but refused to accept) the Human Rights Award for Literature for ''Inside Black Australia'', a poetry anthology and exhibition of Aboriginal photography.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://teaching.austlit.edu.au/?q=node/12205 | title=Gilbert, Kevin |publisher=Teaching Aust.

In [[Gujurat]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]] in [[South India]], there are several communities of Black African descent known as the [[Siddi]]s (Sheedis). In the [[Makran]] strip of the [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] provinces in southwestern [[Pakistan]], these people are known as the [[Makrani]].

The [[Negrito]]s are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of Southeast Asia. Negrito means “little black people” in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro, i.e., "little black person"); it is what the Spaniards called the short black people they encountered in the [[Philippines]].<ref name="William Marsden 1834 4">{{cite book|author=William Marsden|chapter=On the Polynesian, or East-Insular Languages|title =Miscellaneous works of William Marsden|publisher =Pub. for the Author by Parbury, Allen|year =1834|page=4|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=O78NAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

About 150,000 black people live in Israel, amounting to just over 2% of the nation's population. The vast majority of these, some 120,000, are [[Beta Israel]],<ref>[http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2009n/11_09_252b.pdf "The Ethiopian Population In Israel"], Reuters. 16 July 2009.</ref> most of whom came during the 1980s and 1990s from [[Ethiopia]]<ref>"[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0902/p06s01-wome.html Why Jews see racism in Israel"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 1 September 2009.</ref> In addition, Israel is home to over 5,000 members of the [[African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem]] movement, who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the [[Negev]] town of [[Dimona]]. Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel, most of them converts from the UK, Canada, and the United States. Thousands of mixed-race individuals with non-black Jewish relatives also live in Israel.

Additionally, there are around 60,000 non-Jewish African immigrants in Israel. Most of the migrants are from the black communities in multiracial [[Sudan]] and [[Eritrea]], particularly the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]]-speaking [[Nuba peoples|Nuba]] groups of the southern [[Nuba Mountains]].<ref>[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article43625 Israel deports Sudanese asylum seekers as S.
