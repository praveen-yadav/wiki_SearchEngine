'''Andriscus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀνδρίσκος}} - ''Andriskos''), and often called the '''Pseudo-Philip''', was the last [[King of Macedon]] (149–148 BC), and ruler of [[Edremit (District), Balıkesir|Adramyttium]] in [[Aeolis]] (in western [[Anatolia]]).

In 168 BC, the Romans invaded [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and overthrew the king, [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]], in the [[Battle of Pydna|First Battle of Pydna]].

In 149 BC, Andriskos, at that time ruler of Adramyttium only, and claiming to be Perseus' son, announced his intention to retake Macedonia from the Romans.

As his first attempt, Andriskos travelled to [[Syria]] to request military help from [[Demetrius I of Syria|Demetrius Soter of Syria]]. Demetrius instead handed him over to the Romans.

Andriskos escaped from Roman captivity, and raised a [[Thracians|Thracian]] army. With this army, he invaded Macedonia and defeated the Roman praetor [[Publius Juventius]] in 149 BC. Andriskos then declared himself King Philip VI of Macedonia.

In 148 BC, Andriskos conquered [[Thessaly]] and made an alliance with [[Carthage]], thus bringing the Roman wrath on him.  In 148 BC, in what the Romans called the [[Fourth Macedonian War]], he was defeated by the Roman praetor [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus|Q. Caecilius Metellus]] (148) at the [[Battle of Pydna (148 BC)|Second Battle of Pydna]], and fled to [[Thrace]], whose prince gave him up to [[Rome]], thus marking the final end to Andriskos' reign of Macedonia.

Andriscus's brief reign over Macedonia was marked by cruelty and extortion. After this Macedonia was formally reduced to a Roman province.
