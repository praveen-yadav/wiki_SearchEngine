==History and background==
The molecular and packing structures of collagen have eluded scientists over decades of research.

==Synthesis==
First, a three-dimensional stranded structure is assembled, with the amino acids glycine and proline as its principal components. This is not yet collagen but its precursor, procollagen. A recent study{{which?|date=November 2013}} shows that [[vitamin C]] must have an important role in its synthesis. Prolonged exposure of cultures of human connective-tissue cells to ascorbate induced an eight-fold increase in the synthesis of collagen with no increase in the rate of synthesis of other proteins. <ref>(Murad et al., 1981).</ref> Since the production of procollagen must precede the production of collagen, vitamin C must have a role in this step. The conversion involves a reaction that substitutes a hydroxyl group, -OH, for a hydrogen atom, H, in the proline residues at certain points in the polypeptide chains, converting those residues to hydroxyproline. This hydroxylation reaction organizes the chains in the conformation necessary for them to form a triple helix.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Shoulders |first1=M. D. |last2=Raines |first2=R.

The synthesis of collagen occurs inside and outside of the cell. The formation of collagen which results in fibrillary collagen (most common form) is discussed here. Meshwork collagen, which is often involved in the formation of filtration systems, is the other form of collagen. All types of collagens are triple helices, and the differences lie in the make-up of the alpha peptides created in step 2.
# '''Transcription of mRNA''': About 34 genes are associated with collagen formation, each coding for a specific mRNA sequence, and typically have the "''COL''" prefix. The beginning of collagen synthesis begins with turning on genes which are associated with the formation of a particular alpha peptide (typically alpha 1, 2 or 3).
# '''Pre-pro-peptide formation''': Once the final mRNA exits from the cell nucleus and enters into the cytoplasm, it links with the ribosomal subunits and the process of translation occurs. The early/first part of the new peptide is known as the signal sequence. The signal sequence on the [[N-terminal]] of the peptide is recognized by a [[signal recognition particle]] on the endoplasmic reticulum, which will be responsible for directing the pre-pro-peptide into the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, once the synthesis of new peptide is finished, it goes directly into the endoplasmic reticulum for post-translational processing. It is now known as pre-pro-collagen.
# '''Alpha peptide to procollagen''': Three modifications of the pre-pro-peptide occur leading to the formation of the alpha peptide. Secondly, the triple helix known as procollagen is formed before being transported in a transport vesicle to the golgi apparatus. 1) The signal peptide on the N-terminal is dissolved, and the molecule is now known as ''propeptide'' (not procollagen). 2) Hydroxylation of lysines and prolines on propeptide by the enzymes 'prolyl hydroxylase' and 'lysyl hydroxylase' (to produce hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine) occurs to aid cross-linking of the alpha peptides. This enzymatic step requires vitamin C as a cofactor. In scurvy, the lack of hydroxylation of prolines and lysines causes a looser triple helix (which is formed by three alpha peptides). 3) Glycosylation occurs by adding either glucose or galactose monomers onto the hydroxy groups that were placed onto lysines, but not on prolines. From here the hydroxylated and glycosylated propeptide twists towards the left very tightly and then three propeptides will form a triple helix. It is important to remember that this molecule, now known as 'procollagen' (not propeptide) is composed of a twisted portion (center) and two loose ends on either end. At this point, the procollagen is packaged into a transfer vesicle destined for the Golgi apparatus.
# '''Golgi apparatus modification''': In the Golgi apparatus, the procollagen goes through one last post-translational modification before being secreted out of the cell. In this step, oligosaccharides (not monosaccharides as in step 3) are added, and then the procollagen is packaged into a secretory vesicle destined for the extracellular space.
# '''Formation of tropocollagen''': Once outside the cell, membrane bound enzymes known as 'collagen peptidases', remove the "loose ends" of the procollagen molecule. What is left is known as tropocollagen. Defects in this step produce one of the many collagenopathies known as [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]]. This step is absent when synthesizing type III, a type of fibrilar collagen.
# '''Formation of the collagen fibril''': 'Lysyl oxidase', an extracellular enzyme, produces the final step in the collagen synthesis pathway. This enzyme acts on lysines and hydroxylysines producing aldehyde groups, which will eventually undergo covalent bonding between tropocollagen molecules. This polymer of tropocollogen is known as a collagen fibril.

===Amino acids===
Collagen has an unusual [[amino acid]] composition and sequence:
* [[Glycine]]  is found at almost every third [[residue (chemistry)|residue]].
* [[Proline]] makes up about 17% of collagen.
* Collagen contains two uncommon derivative amino acids not directly inserted during [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. These amino acids are found at specific locations relative to glycine and are modified post-translationally by different enzymes, both of which require [[vitamin C]] as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].
** [[Hydroxyproline]] derived from proline
** [[Hydroxylysine]] derived from [[lysine]] - depending on the type of collagen, varying numbers of hydroxylysines are [[glycosylation|glycosylated]] (mostly having [[disaccharide]]s attached).

[[Cortisol]] stimulates [[Amide hydrolysis|degradation]] of (skin) collagen into amino acids.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Houck |first=J. C. |last2=Sharma |first2=V. K. |last3=Patel |first3=Y.

===Collagen I formation===
Most collagen forms in a similar manner, but the following process is typical for type I:

#Inside the cell
##Two types of alpha helices are formed during [[translation (genetics)|translation]] on ribosomes along the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] (RER): alpha-1 and alpha-2 helices. These form peptide chains (known as [[preprocollagen]]) have [[registration peptide]]s on each end and a [[signal peptide]].
##Polypeptide chains are released into the lumen of the RER.
##Signal peptides are cleaved inside the RER and the chains are now known as pro-alpha chains.
##[[Hydroxylation]] of [[lysine]] and [[proline]] amino acids occurs inside the lumen. This process is dependent on [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].
##[[Glycosylation]] of specific hydroxylysine residues occurs.
##Triple ɣ helical structure is formed inside the endoplasmic reticulum from each two alpha-1 chains and one alpha-2 chain.
##[[Procollagen]] is shipped to the [[Golgi apparatus]], where it is packaged and secreted by [[exocytosis]].
#Outside the cell
##Registration peptides are cleaved and tropocollagen is formed by [[procollagen peptidase]].
##Multiple tropocollagen molecules form collagen fibrils, via covalent cross-linking ([[aldol reaction]]) by [[lysyl oxidase]] which links hydroxylysine and lysine residues. Multiple collagen fibrils form into collagen fibers.
##Collagen may be attached to cell membranes via several types of protein, including [[fibronectin]] and [[integrin]].

===Synthetic pathogenesis===
Vitamin C deficiency causes [[scurvy]], a serious and painful disease in which defective collagen prevents the formation of strong [[connective tissue]]. [[Gingiva|Gums]] deteriorate and bleed, with loss of teeth; skin discolors, and [[wound]]s do not heal.  Prior to the 18th century, this condition was notorious among long-duration military, particularly naval, expeditions during which participants were deprived of foods containing vitamin C.

An [[autoimmune disease]] such as [[lupus erythematosus]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Al-Hadithy |first=H. |last2=''et al.'' |year=1982 |first2=DA |last3=Addison |first3=IE |last4=Goldstone |first4=AH |last5=Snaith |first5=ML |title=Neutrophil function in systemic lupus erythematosus and other collagen diseases |journal=Ann Rheum Dis |volume=41 |pmid=7065727 |issue=1 |pmc=1000860 |pages=33–38 |doi=10.1136/ard.41.1.33 }}</ref> may attack healthy collagen fibers.

Many bacteria and viruses secrete [[virulence factor]]s, such as the enzyme [[collagenase]], which destroys collagen or interferes with its production.

==Molecular structure==
The tropocollagen or collagen molecule is a subunit of larger collagen aggregates such as fibrils. At approximately 300&nbsp;nm long and 1.5&nbsp;nm in diameter, it is made up of three [[polypeptide]] strands (called alpha peptides, see step 2), each possessing the conformation of a left-handed [[helix]] (its name is not to be confused with the commonly occurring alpha helix, a right-handed structure). These three left-handed helices are twisted together into a right-handed triple helix or "super helix", a cooperative [[quaternary structure]] stabilized by numerous [[hydrogen bond]]s. With type I collagen and possibly all fibrillar collagens if not all collagens, each triple-helix associates into a right-handed super-super-coil referred to as the collagen microfibril. Each microfibril is interdigitated with its neighboring microfibrils to a degree that might suggest they are individually unstable, although within collagen fibrils, they are so well ordered as to be crystalline.

A distinctive feature of collagen is the regular arrangement of [[amino acid]]s in each of the three chains of these collagen subunits. The sequence often follows the pattern [[glycine|Gly]]-[[proline|Pro]]-X or Gly-X-[[hydroxyproline|Hyp]], where X may be any of various other amino acid residues.<ref name="SzpakJAS"/> Proline or hydroxyproline constitute about 1/6 of the total sequence. With glycine accounting for the 1/3 of the sequence, this means approximately half of the collagen sequence is not glycine, proline or hydroxyproline, a fact often missed due to the distraction of the unusual GX<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub> character of collagen alpha-peptides. The high glycine content of collagen is important with respect to stabilization of the collagen helix as this allows the very close association of the collagen fibers within the molecule, facilitating hydrogen bonding and the formation of intermolecular cross-links.<ref name="SzpakJAS"/> This kind of regular repetition and high glycine content is found in only a few other fibrous proteins, such as [[silk]] [[fibroin]]. About 75–80% of silk is (approximately) -Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala- with 10% [[serine]], and [[elastin]] is rich in glycine, proline, and alanine (Ala), whose [[side chain|side group]] is a small [[methyl]] group. Such high glycine and regular repetitions are never found in globular proteins save for very short sections of their sequence. [[Chemical reaction|Chemically reactive]] side groups are not needed in structural proteins, as they are in enzymes and [[Membrane transport protein|transport protein]]s; however, collagen is not quite just a structural protein. Due to its key role in the determination of cell phenotype, cell adhesion, tissue regulation and infrastructure, many sections of its nonproline-rich regions have cell or matrix association / regulation roles. The relatively high content of proline and hydroxyproline rings, with their geometrically constrained [[carboxyl]] and (secondary) [[amino]] groups, along with the rich abundance of glycine, accounts for the tendency of the individual polypeptide strands to form left-handed helices spontaneously, without any intrachain hydrogen bonding.

Because glycine is the smallest amino acid with no side chain, it plays a unique role in fibrous structural proteins. In collagen, Gly is required at every third position because the assembly of the triple helix puts this residue at the interior (axis) of the helix, where there is no space for a larger side group than glycine’s single [[hydrogen|hydrogen atom]]. For the same reason, the rings of the Pro and Hyp must point outward. These two amino acids help stabilize the triple helix—Hyp even more so than Pro; a lower concentration of them is required in animals such as [[fish]], whose [[thermoregulation|body temperatures]] are lower than most warm-blooded animals. Lower proline and hydroxyproline contents are characteristic of cold-water, but not warm-water fish; the latter tend to have similar proline and hydroxyproline contents to mammals.<ref name="SzpakJAS"/> The lower proline and hydroxproline contents of cold-water fish and other [[poikilothermic|poikilotherm]] animals leads to their collagen having a lower thermal stability than mammalian collagen.<ref name="SzpakJAS"/> This lower thermal stability means that [[gelatin]] derived from fish collagen is not suitable for many food and industrial applications.

Collagen fibrils/aggregates are arranged in different combinations and concentrations in various tissues to provide varying tissue properties. In bone, entire collagen triple helices lie in a parallel, staggered array. 40&nbsp;nm gaps between the ends of the tropocollagen subunits (approximately equal to the gap region) probably serve as nucleation sites for the deposition of long, hard, fine crystals of the mineral component, which is (approximately)  Ca<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>.<ref>Ross, M. H. and Pawlina, W. (2011) ''Histology'', 6th ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, p. 218.</ref>  Type I collagen gives bone its [[tensile strength]].

==Types and associated disorders==
Collagen occurs in many places throughout the body. Over 90% of the collagen in the body, however, is of type I.<ref>Sabiston textbook of surgery board review, 7th edition. Chapter 5 wound healing, question 14</ref>

So far, 28 types of collagen have been identified and described.  The five most common types are:

*Collagen I: skin, tendon, vascular ligature, organs, bone (main component of the organic part of bone)
*Collagen II: [[cartilage]] (main component of cartilage)
*Collagen III: reticulate (main component of [[reticular fiber]]s), commonly found alongside type I.
*Collagen IV: forms basal lamina, the epithelium-secreted layer of the basement membrane.
*Collagen V: cell surfaces, hair and placenta

Collagen-related diseases most commonly arise from genetic defects or nutritional deficiencies that affect the biosynthesis, assembly, postranslational modification, secretion, or other processes involved in normal collagen production.

==Characteristics==
Collagen is one of the long, [[fibrous protein|fibrous structural proteins]] whose functions are quite different from those of [[globular protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s. Tough bundles of collagen called ''collagen fibers'' are a major component of the [[extracellular matrix]] that supports most tissues and gives cells structure from the outside, but collagen is also found inside certain cells. Collagen has great [[tensile strength]], and is the main component of [[fascia]], [[cartilage]], [[ligament]]s, [[tendon]]s, [[bone]] and skin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fratzl |first=P. |title=Collagen: Structure and Mechanics |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=0-387-73905-X }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Buehler |first=M.

It is present in the [[cornea]] and lens of the [[human eye|eye]] in [[crystal]]line form.

===Uses===
Collagen has a wide variety of applications, from food to medical.  For instance, it is used in [[plastic surgery|cosmetic surgery]] and [[burn (injury)|burns surgery]].   It is widely used in the form of collagen [[casing (sausage)|casings]] for sausages, which are also used in the manufacture of [[Strings_(music)#Gut|musical strings]].

If collagen is sufficiently denatured, e.g. by heating, the three tropocollagen strands separate partially or completely into globular domains, containing a different secondary structure to the normal collagen polyproline II (PPII), e.g. [[random coil]]s. This process describes the formation of [[gelatin]], which is used in many [[food]]s, including flavored [[gelatin dessert]]s. Besides food, gelatin has been used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and photography industries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060505134337/http://www.gmap-gelatin.com/gelatin_adv.html |title=Gelatin's Advantages: Health, Nutrition and Safety |work=gmap-gelatin.com}}</ref>
From a nutritional point of view, collagen and gelatin are a poor-quality sole source of protein since they do not contain all the [[essential amino acid]]s in the proportions that the human body requires—they are not '[[complete protein]]s' (as defined by food science, not that they are partially structured). Manufacturers of collagen-based [[dietary supplement]]s claim that their products can improve skin and [[fingernail]] quality as well as joint health. However, mainstream scientific research has not shown strong evidence to support these claims.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Individuals with problems in these areas are more likely to be suffering from some other underlying condition (such as normal aging, dry skin, arthritis etc.) rather than just a protein deficiency.

From the Greek for glue, ''kolla'', the word collagen means "[[animal glue|glue]] producer" and refers to the early process of boiling the skin and [[tendon|sinews]] of [[horse]]s and other animals to obtain glue. Collagen adhesive was used by [[Egypt]]ians about 4,000 years ago, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] used it in [[bow (weapon)|bows]] about 1,500 years ago. The oldest glue in the world, [[radiocarbon dating|carbon-dated]] as more than 8,000 years old, was found to be collagen—used as a protective lining on rope baskets and [[embroidery|embroidered]] [[Textile|fabric]]s, and to hold [[list of eating utensils|utensils]] together; also in crisscross decorations on [[human]] [[human skull|skull]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/glue.html |title=Oldest Glue Discovered |work=Archaeology |date=May 21, 1998 |first=Amélie A. |last=Walker }}</ref> Collagen normally converts to gelatin, but survived due to the dry conditions. Animal glues are [[thermoplastic]], softening again upon reheating, and so they are still used in making [[musical instrument]]s such as fine [[violin]]s and [[guitar]]s, which may have to be reopened for repairs—an application incompatible with tough, [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[plastic]] adhesives, which are permanent. Animal sinews and skins, including [[leather]], have been used to make useful articles for millennia.

Gelatin-[[resorcinol]]-[[formaldehyde]] glue (and with formaldehyde replaced by less-toxic pentanedial and [[glyoxal|ethanedial]]) has been used to repair experimental incisions in [[rabbit]] [[lung]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ennker |first=I.

==Medical uses==

===Cardiac applications===
{{cleanup|section|date=December 2010}}
The four collagenous [[valve]] rings, the [[central body of the heart]] and the extended [[cardiac skeleton]] of the heart are histologically and uniquely bound to cardiac muscle. Collagen is the floor of the atria adjoining the ceiling of the ventricles. Collagen contribution to [[cardiac performance]] summarily represents an essential, unique and moving solid form of mass opposed to the [[fluid mechanics]] of [[blood]] mass movement within the heart.
The collagenous structure that divides the upper chambers of the heart from the lower chambers is an impermeable firewall that excludes both blood and electrical influence through customary anatomical channels. Thanks to collagen, [[atrial fibrillation]] almost never deteriorates to [[ventricular fibrillation]]. Collagen is infiltrated in varying densities with cardiac muscle mass. The amount (mass), distribution, age and density of collagen all contribute to the [[compliance (physiology)|compliance]] required to move blood back and forth.    
Individual cardiac valvular leaflets are forged into shape by specialized collagen under variable [[pressure]]. Gradual [[calcium]] deposition within collagen occurs as a natural consequence of aging. Calcium rich fixed points within collagen in a moving display of blood and muscle enables methods of [[cardiac imaging]] technology to arrive at ratios essentially stating blood in [[cardiac input]] and blood out [[cardiac output]].
Pathology of the collagen underpinning of the heart is closely related to the category [[connective tissue disease]].

===Type II collagen and rheumatoid arthritis===
According to a study<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Trentham |first=D. |last2=Dynesius-Trentham |first2=R. |last3=Orav |first3=J. |last4=Combitchi |first4=D. |last5=Lorenzo |first5=C. |last6=Sewell |first6=K. |last7=Hafler |first7=D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |first8=H. |last8=Weiner |title=Effects of Oral Administration of Type II Collagen on Rheumatoid Arthritis |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=1993 |volume=261 |issue=5119 |pages=1727–1730 |doi=10.1126/science.8378772 |bibcode = 1993Sci...261.1727T }}</ref> published in the journal Science, oral administration of [[type II collagen]] improves symptoms of [[rheumatoid arthritis]].  The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving 60 patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in the number of swollen joints and tender joints occurred in subjects fed with chicken type II collagen for 3 months, but not in those that received a placebo. Four patients in the collagen group had complete remission of the disease. No side effects were evident.

===Hydrolyzed type II collagen and osteoarthritis===
A published study<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schauss, A., Stenehjem, J., Park, J., Endres, J., and Clewell, A.|pmid=22486722|year=2012|title=Effect of the novel low molecular weight hydrolyzed chicken sternal cartilage extract, BioCell Collagen, on improving osteoarthritis-related symptoms: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial|volume=60|issue=16|pages=4096–101|doi=10.1021/jf205295u|journal=Journal of agricultural and food chemistry}}</ref> reports that ingestion of a novel low molecular weight hydrolyzed chicken sternal cartilage extract, containing a matrix of [[hydrolyzed type II collagen]], [[chondroitin sulfate]], and [[hyaluronic acid]], marketed under the brand name [[BioCell Collagen]], relieves joint discomfort associated with [[osteoarthritis]]. A [[randomized controlled trial]] (RCT) enrolling 80 subjects demonstrated that BioCell Collagen was well tolerated with no serious [[adverse event]] and led to a significant improvement in joint mobility compared to the placebo group on days 35 (p = 0.007) and 70 (p < 0.001).

===Cosmetic surgery===
Collagen has been widely used in cosmetic surgery, as a healing aid for burn patients for reconstruction of bone and a wide variety of dental, orthopedic and surgical purposes. Both human and bovine collagen is widely used as dermal fillers for treatment of wrinkles and skin aging.<ref name="pharmax2">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/03/the-ageing-skin-part-4e-dermal-fillers/ Dermal Fillers | The Ageing Skin]. Pharmaxchange.info. Retrieved on 2013-04-21.</ref> Some points of interest are:
#when used cosmetically, there is a chance of allergic reactions causing prolonged redness; however, this can be virtually eliminated by simple and inconspicuous patch testing prior to cosmetic use, and
#most medical collagen is derived from young beef cattle (bovine) from certified [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]-free animals. Most manufacturers use donor animals from either "closed herds", or from countries which have never had a reported case of BSE such as Australia, Brazil and New Zealand.
#porcine (pig) tissue is also widely used for producing collagen sheet for a variety of surgical purposes.
#alternatives using the patient's own [[fat]], [[hyaluronic acid]] or [[polyacrylamide]] gels which are readily available.

===Bone grafts===
As the skeleton forms the structure of the body, it is vital that it maintains its strength, even after breaks and injuries. Collagen is used in bone grafting as it has a triple helical structure, making it a very strong molecule. It is ideal for use in bones, as it does not compromise the structural integrity of the skeleton. The triple helical structure of collagen prevents it from being broken down by enzymes, it enables adhesiveness of cells and it is important for the proper assembly of the extracellular matrix.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cunniffe|first=G|coauthors=F O'Brien|title=Collagen scaffolds for orthopedic regenerative medicine|journal=The Journal of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society|year=2011|volume=63|issue=4|pages=66–73|doi=10.1007/s11837-011-0061-y|bibcode = 2011JOM....63d..66C }}</ref>

===Tissue regeneration===
Collagen scaffolds are used in tissue regeneration, either in sponges, thin sheets or gels. Collagen has the correct properties for tissue regeneration such as pore structure, permeability, hydrophilicity and it is stable in vivo. Collagen scaffolds are also ideal for the deposition of cells, such as [[osteoblasts]] and [[fibroblast]]s and once inserted, growth is able to continue as normal in the tissue.<ref name=Oliveira>{{cite journal|last=Oliveira|first=S|coauthors=R Ringshia, R Legeros, E Clark, L Terracio, C Teixeira M Yost|title=An improved collagen scaffold for skeletal regeneration|journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials|year=2009|volume=94|issue=2|pages=371–379|doi=10.1002/jbm.a.32694|pmc=2891373|pmid=20186736}}</ref>

===Reconstructive surgical uses===
Collagens are widely employed in the construction of [[artificial skin]] substitutes used in the management of severe [[burn (injury)|burns]].  These collagens may be derived from bovine, equine or porcine, and even human sources and are sometimes used in combination with [[silicone]]s, [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, [[fibroblast]]s, [[growth factor]]s and other substances.

Collagen is also sold as a pill commercially as a joint mobility supplement with poor references. Because proteins are broken down into amino acids before absorption, there is no reason for orally ingested collagen to affect connective tissue in the body, except through the effect of individual amino acid supplementation.

Collagen is also frequently used in scientific research applications for cell culture, studying cell behavior and cellular interactions with the extracellular environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Blow |first=Nathan |year=2009 |title=Cell culture: building a better matrix |journal=Nature Methods |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=619–622 |doi=10.1038/nmeth0809-619 }}</ref>

===Wound care management uses===
Collagen is one of the body’s key natural resources and a component of skin tissue that can benefit all stages of the wound healing process.  When collagen is made available to the wound bed, closure can occur. Wound deterioration, followed sometimes by procedures such as amputation, can thus be avoided.

Collagen is a natural product, therefore it is used as a natural wound dressing and has properties that artificial wound dressings do not have. It is resistant against bacteria, which is of vital importance in a wound dressing. It helps to keep the wound sterile, because of its natural ability to fight infection. When collagen is used as a burn dressing, healthy [[granulation tissue]] is able to form very quickly over the burn, helping it to heal rapidly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=O|coauthors=SS Gupta, M Soni, S Moses, S Shukla, RK Mathur|title=Collagen dressing versus conventional dressings in burn and chronic wounds: a retrospective study|journal=Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery|year=2011|volume=4|issue=1|pages=12–16|doi=10.4103/0974-2077.79180|pmid=21572675|pmc=3081477}}</ref>

Throughout the 4 phases of wound healing, collagen performs the following functions in wound healing:
*Guiding function: Collagen fibers serve to guide fibroblasts. Fibroblasts migrate along a connective tissue matrix.
*Chemotactic properties:  The large surface area available on collagen fibers can attract fibrogenic cells which help in healing.
*Nucleation: Collagen, in the presence of certain neutral salt molecules can act as a nucleating agent causing formation of fibrillar structures. A collagen wound dressing might serve as a guide for orienting new collagen deposition and capillary growth.
*Hemostatic properties: Blood platelets interact with the collagen to make a hemostatic plug.
