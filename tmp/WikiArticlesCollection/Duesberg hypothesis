The '''Duesberg hypothesis''' is the claim, associated with [[University of California, Berkeley]], professor [[Peter Duesberg]], that various noninfectious factors such as [[recreational drug|recreational]] and pharmaceutical drug use are the cause of [[AIDS]], and that [[HIV]] (human immunodeficiency virus) is merely a harmless [[passenger virus]].<ref name="DuesbergJBiosci"/> The most prominent supporters of this hypothesis are Duesberg himself, [[biochemist]] and vitamin proponent [[David Rasnick]], and journalist [[Celia Farber]]. The [[scientific community]] contends that Duesberg’s arguments are the result of [[cherry-picking]] predominantly outdated scientific data<ref>{{cite journal | author = Galea P, Chermann JC. | title = HIV as the cause of AIDS and associated diseases | journal = Genetica | volume = 104 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–142 | year = 1998 | pmid = 10220906 | doi = 10.1023/A:1003432603348}}</ref> and selectively ignoring evidence in favor of HIVs’ role in AIDS.<ref name="phenom">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7992043 | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J. | year = 1994 | title = The Duesberg phenomenon | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/cohen/266-5191-1642a.pdf | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5191| pages = 1642–1644 | pmid = 7992043 | bibcode=1994Sci...266.1642C}}</ref> The [[scientific consensus]] is that the Duesberg hypothesis is incorrect and that HIV is the cause of AIDS.<ref name="niaid">[http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/How+HIV+Causes+AIDS/HIVcausesAIDS.htm National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease Fact Sheet: The Evidence that HIV Causes AIDS].

==Role of legal and illegal drug use==
Duesberg argues that there is a statistical [[correlation]] between trends in recreational drug use and trends in AIDS cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Duesberg P, Rasnick D |title=The AIDS dilemma: drug diseases blamed on a passenger virus |journal=Genetica |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=85–132 |year=1998 |pmid=10220905 |doi=10.1023/A:1003405220186}}</ref> He argues that the [[AIDS epidemic|epidemic]] of AIDS cases in the 1980s corresponds to a supposed epidemic of recreational drug use in the [[United States]] and Europe during the same time frame.

These claims are not supported by [[epidemiology|epidemiologic data]]. The average yearly increase in opioid-related deaths from 1990 to 2002 was nearly three times the yearly increase from 1979–90, with the greatest increase in 2000–02, yet AIDS cases and deaths fell dramatically during the mid-to-late-1990s.<ref name="drugusepharmaco">{{cite journal |author=Paulozzi LJ, Budnitz DS, Yongli X |title=Increasing deaths from opioid analgesics in the United States |journal=Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety |volume=15 |issue=9 |pages=618–27 |year=2006 |pmid=16862602 |doi=10.1002/pds.1276}}</ref> Duesberg’s claim that recreational drug use, rather than HIV, was the cause of AIDS has been specifically examined and found to be false. Cohort studies have found that only HIV-positive drug users develop [[opportunistic infection]]s; HIV-negative drug users do not develop such infections, indicating that HIV rather than drug use is the cause of AIDS.<ref name="niaid"/><ref name="drugusenature">{{cite journal |author=Ascher MS, Sheppard HW, Winkelstein W, Vittinghoff E |title=Does drug use cause AIDS? |journal=Nature |volume=362 |issue=6416 |pages=103–4 |year=1993 |pmid=8095697 |doi=10.1038/362103a0 |bibcode=1993Natur.362..103A}}</ref>

Duesberg has also argued that [[nitrite inhalant]]s were the cause of the epidemic of [[Kaposi sarcoma]] (KS) in gay men. However, this argument has been described as an example of the [[fallacy]] of a statistical [[confounding]] effect;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morabia A |title=Poppers, Kaposi's sarcoma, and HIV infection: empirical example of a strong confounding effect? |journal=Prev Med |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=90–5 |year=1995 |pmid=7661947 |doi=10.1006/pmed.1995.1014}}</ref> it is now known that [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|a herpesvirus]], potentiated by HIV, is responsible for AIDS-associated KS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kedes D, Operskalski E, Busch M, Kohn R, Flood J, Ganem D |title=The seroepidemiology of human herpesvirus 8 (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus): distribution of infection in KS risk groups and evidence for sexual transmission |journal=Nat Med |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=918–24 |year=1996 |pmid=8705863 |doi=10.1038/nm0896-918}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin J, Ganem D, Osmond D, Page-Shafer K, Macrae D, Kedes D |title=Sexual transmission and the natural history of human herpesvirus 8 infection |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=338 |issue=14 |pages=948–54 |year=1998 |pmid=9521982 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199804023381403}}</ref>

Moreover, in addition to recreational drugs, Duesberg argues that anti-HIV drugs such as [[zidovudine]] (AZT) can cause AIDS. Duesber’s claim that antiviral medication causes AIDS is regarded as disproven by the scientific community. Placebo-controlled studies have found that AZT as a single agent produces modest and short-lived improvements in survival and delays the development of opportunistic infections; it certainly did not cause AIDS, which develops in both treated and untreated study patients. With the subsequent development of [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]s and [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]], numerous studies have documented the fact that anti-HIV drugs prevent the development of AIDS and substantially prolong survival, further disproving the claim that these drugs “cause” AIDS.<ref name="niaid"/>

===Scientific study and rejection of Duesberg’s risk-AIDS hypothesis===
Several studies have specifically addressed Duesberg’s claim that recreational drug abuse or [[sexual promiscuity]] were responsible for the manifestations of AIDS. An early study of his claims, published in ''[[Nature]]'' in 1993, found Duesberg’s drug abuse-AIDS hypothesis to have “no basis in fact.”<ref name="drugusenature"/>

A large [[prospective study]] followed a group of 715 [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] men in the Vancouver, Canada, area; approximately half were HIV-seropositive or became so during the follow-up period, and the remainder were HIV-seronegative. After more than 8 years of follow-up, despite similar rates of drug use, sexual contact, and other supposed risk factors in both groups, only the HIV-positive group suffered from [[opportunistic infection]]s. Similarly, [[CD4]] counts dropped in the patients who were HIV-infected, but remained stable in the HIV-negative patients, despite similar rates of risk behavior.<ref name="lancet1993"/> The authors concluded that “the risk-AIDS hypothesis ... is clearly rejected by our data,” and that “the evidence supports the hypothesis that HIV-1 has an integral role in the CD4 depletion and progressive immune dysfunction that characterise AIDS.”<ref name="lancet1993">{{cite journal | author = Schechter M, Craib K, Gelmon K, Montaner J, Le T, O'Shaughnessy M | title = HIV-1 and the aetiology of AIDS. | journal = Lancet | volume = 341 | issue = 8846 | pages = 658–9 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8095571 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(93)90421-C}}</ref>

Similarly, the [[Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study]] (MACS) and the [[Women's Interagency HIV Study]] (WIHS)—which between them observed more than 8,000 Americans—demonstrated that “the presence of HIV infection is the only factor that is strongly and consistently associated with the conditions that define AIDS.”<ref name="macs">[http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/focuson/hiv/resources/macs_and_wihs.htm MACS and WIHS Studies Provide Overwhelming Evidence That HIV Causes AIDS].

==Current AIDS definitions==
Duesberg argued in 1989 that a significant number of AIDS victims had died without proof of HIV infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Duesberg P |title=Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: correlation but not causation |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=755–64 |year=1989 |pmid=2644642 |doi=10.1073/pnas.86.3.755 |pmc=286556|bibcode = 1989PNAS...86..755D }}</ref> However, with the use of modern culture techniques and [[polymerase chain reaction]] testing, HIV can be demonstrated in virtually all patients with AIDS.<ref name="niaid"/> Since AIDS is now defined partially by the presence of HIV, Duesberg claims it is impossible by definition to offer evidence that AIDS doesn’t require HIV. However, the first definitions of AIDS mentioned no cause and the first AIDS diagnoses were made before HIV was discovered. The addition of HIV positivity to surveillance criteria as an absolutely necessary condition for case reporting occurred only in 1993, after a scientific consensus was established that HIV caused AIDS.<ref>[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,'' 31(37), 24 Sep 1982] ''Update on Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), United States.''</ref><ref>[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,'' 34(25), 28 June 1985] ''Revision of the CDC Surveillance Case Definition of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome for National Reporting, United States.''</ref><ref>[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,'' 36(S1), 14 August 1987] ''Revision of the CDC Surveillance Case Definition for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.''</ref><ref>[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,'' 41(RR-17), 18 December 1992] ''1993 Revised Classification System for HIV Infection and Expanded Surveillance Definition for AIDS Among Adolescents and Adults.''</ref>

==AIDS in Africa==
According to the Duesberg hypothesis, AIDS is not found in Africa. What Duesberg calls “the myth of an African AIDS epidemic,”<ref name = "uirhmj">[Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. ISBN 0-89526-399-8] Page 291.</ref> among people"<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jun/15-aids-dissident-seeks-redemption-and-a-cure-for-cancer Discover Magazine feature on Duesberg.] Jeanne Linzer, Discover, 15 May 2008, ''AIDS "Dissident" Seeks Redemption...and a Cure for Cancer.'' Accessed 16 May 2008.</ref> exists for several reasons, including:
*The need, according to Duesberg, of the CDC, the WHO, and other health organizations to justify their existences, resulting in their “manufacturing contagious plagues out of noninfectious medical conditions.”<ref>[Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. ISBN 0-89526-399-8] Page 137.</ref>
*Media sensationalism, with stories that “helped shape the Western impression of an AIDS problem out of control,” resulting in high levels of funding.<ref name = "uirhmj"/>
*Willing participation in deception by local doctors who wish to take advantage of this aid money: “African doctors themselves participate in building the myth of the AIDS pandemic.”<ref>[Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. ISBN 0-89526-399-8] Pages 290-1.</ref>
*Confusion or incompetence on the part of African doctors: “Many common Third World diseases are confused with AIDS even if they are not part of its official definition.”<ref>[Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. ISBN 0-89526-399-8] Page 293.</ref>

Duesberg states that African AIDS cases are “a collection of long-established, indigenous diseases, such as chronic fevers, weight loss, alias “slim disease,” diarrhea, and tuberculosis”<ref name="DuesbergJBiosci">{{cite journal |author=Duesberg P, Koehnlein C, Rasnick D |title=The chemical bases of the various AIDS epidemics: recreational drugs, anti-viral chemotherapy and malnutrition |journal=J Biosci |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=383–412 |year=2003 |pmid=12799487 |doi=10.1007/BF02705115}}</ref> that result from malnutrition and poor sanitation.

According to Duesberg, common diseases are easily misdiagnosed as AIDS in Africa because “the diagnosis of African AIDS is arbitrary” and does not include HIV testing.<ref name="DuesbergJBiosci"/> A definition of AIDS agreed upon in 1985 by the [[World Health Organization]] in [[Bangui]] did not require a positive HIV test, but since 1985, many African countries have added positive HIV tests to the Bangui criteria for AIDS or changed their definitions to match those of the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/hiv/strategic/en/use_aids_def.xls] From the [[World Health Organization]] Accessed 1 May 2008.</ref> One of the reasons for using more HIV tests despite their expense is that, rather than overestimating AIDS as Duesberg suggests, the Bangui definition alone excluded nearly half of African AIDS patients.”<ref>{{cite journal |author=Diaz T |title=New strategies for HIV surveillance in resource-constrained settings: an overview |journal=AIDS |volume=19 |issue=Suppl2 |pages=S1–S8 |year=2005 |pmid=15930836 |doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000172871.80723.3e |author-separator=, |author2=De Cock K |display-authors=2 |last3=Brown |first3=Tim |last4=Ghys |first4=Peter D |last5=Boerma |first5=J Ties}}</ref>

Duesberg notes that diseases associated with AIDS differ between African and Western populations, concluding that the causes of immunodeficiency must be different. [[Tuberculosis]] is much more commonly diagnosed among AIDS patients in Africa than in Western countries, while [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|PCP]] conforms to the opposite pattern.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J | title = Is AIDS in Africa a distinct disease? | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5474 | pages = 2153–5 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10896593 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5474.2153 }}</ref> Tuberculosis, though, had higher prevalence in Africa than in the West before the spread of HIV.

Because reported AIDS cases in Africa and other parts of the developing world include a larger proportion of people who do not belong to Duesberg’s preferred risk groups of drug addicts and male homosexuals,<ref>[http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/global?page=cr09-00-00 Sub-Saharan Africa] From HIV InSite at the University of California, San Francisco. Retrieved 2 May 2008.</ref> Duesberg writes on his website that “There are no risk groups in Africa, like drug addicts and homosexuals.” However, many studies have addressed the issue of risk groups in Africa and concluded that the risk of AIDS is not equally distributed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wade AS |title=HIV infection and sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men in Senegal |journal=AIDS |volume=19 |issue=18 |pages=2133–40 |year=2005 |pmid=16284463 |doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000194128.97640.07 |author-separator=, |author2=Kane CT |display-authors=2 |last3=Diallo |first3=Pape Amadou Niang |last4=Diop |first4=Abdou Khoudia |last5=Gueye |first5=Khady |last6=Mboup |first6=Souleymane |last7=Ndoye |first7=Ibrahima |last8=Lagarde |first8=Emmanuel}} One recent article on AIDS and men who have sex with men (MSM).</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Beyrer C |title=HIV epidemiology update and transmission factors: risks and risk contexts--16th International AIDS Conference epidemiology plenary |journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume=44 |issue=7 |pages=981–7 |year=2007 |doi=10.1086/512371 |pmid=17342654}} A recent article on various risk groups and risk factors in Africa.</ref> In addition, AIDS in Africa largely kills sexually active working-age adults.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nunn | first1 = AJ | last2 = Mulder | first2 = DW | last3 = Kamali | first3 = A | last4 = Ruberantwari | first4 = A | last5 = Kengeya-Kayondo J-F | first5 = Whitworth J. | last6 = Whitworth | year = 1997 | first6 = J | title = Mortality associated with HIV-1 infection over five years in a rural Ugandan population: cohort study | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 315 | issue = 7111| pages = 767–771 | pmid = 9345167 | pmc = 2127535 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Borgdorff | first1 = MW | last2 = Barongo | first2 = LR | last3 = Klokke | first3 = AH | last4 = Newell | first4 = JN | last5 = Senkoro | first5 = KP | last6 = Velema | first6 = JP | last7 = Gabone | first7 = RM. | year = 1995 | title = HIV-1 incidence and HIV-1 associated mortality in a cohort of urban factory workers in Tanzania | url = | journal = Genitourin Med. | volume = 71 | issue = 4| pages = 212–215 | pmid = 7590710 | pmc = 1195515 }}</ref>

==Duesberg’s offer to infect himself==
[[Robert Gallo]] suggested that Duesberg should infect himself with HIV if he insists on maintaining his stance that HIV is harmless. Duesberg claims that he would do so, but that it would be impossible for him to receive the required ethical approval of the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] and the university that employs him to work with HIV.

-->

==Duesberg claims that retroviruses like HIV must be harmless to survive==
Duesberg argues that [[retroviruses]] like HIV must be harmless to survive: they do not kill cells and they do not cause cancer, he maintains. Duesberg writes, “retroviruses do not kill cells because they depend on viable cells for the replication of their RNA from viral DNA integrated into cellular DNA.”<ref name="DuesbergJBiosci"/> Duesberg elsewhere states that “the typical virus reproduces by entering a living cell and commandeering the cell’s resources in order to make new virus particles, a process that ends with the disintegration of the dead cell.”<ref>[Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. ISBN 0-89526-399-8] Page 90.</ref>

Duesberg also rejects the involvement of retroviruses and other viruses in [[cancer]]. To him, virus-associated cancers are “freak accidents of nature” that do not warrant research programs such as the [[War on Cancer]]. Duesberg rejects a role in cancer for numerous viruses, including [[leukemia]] viruses, [[Epstein-Barr Virus]], [[Human Papilloma Virus]], [[Hepatitis B]], [[Feline Leukemia Virus]], and [[Human T-lymphotropic virus]].<ref name="inventing">Duesberg P "Inventing the AIDS Virus" Regnery, 1997. ISBN 0-89526-399-8</ref>

Duesberg claims that the supposedly innocuous nature of all retroviruses is supported by what he considers to be their normal mode of proliferation: infection from mother to child ''in utero''. Duesberg does not suggest that HIV is an [[endogenous retrovirus]], a virus integrated into the [[germ line]] and genetically heritable:

{{Quotation|...[a mother] provides her child with a nine-month continuous exposure to her blood and therefore has at least a 50 percent chance of passing HIV to the baby.<ref name="inventing"/>}}

==Scientific response to the Duesberg hypothesis==
The [[scientific consensus|consensus]] in the [[scientific community]] is that the Duesberg hypothesis has been refuted by a large and growing mass of evidence showing that HIV causes AIDS, that the [[viral load|amount of virus in the blood]] correlates with disease progression, that a plausible mechanism for HIV’s action has been proposed, and that anti-HIV medication decreases [[mortality rate|mortality]] and [[opportunistic infection]] in people with AIDS.<ref name="niaid"/>

In the 9 December 1994 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (Vol. 266, No. 5191),<ref name="phenom" /> Duesberg’s methods and claims were evaluated in a group of articles. The authors concluded that
* It is abundantly evident that HIV causes disease and death in [[hemophiliac]]s, a group generally lacking Duesberg's proposed risk factors.<ref name="niaid"/><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7992044 | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J. | year = 1994a | title = Duesberg and critics agree: Hemophilia is the best test | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/cohen/266-5191-1645a.pdf | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5191| pages = 1645–1646 | pmid = 7992044 | bibcode=1994Sci...266.1645C}}</ref>

* According to researchers who conducted large-scale studies of AZT, the drug does not cause AIDS.

The vast majority of people with AIDS have never received antiretroviral drugs, including those in developed countries prior to the licensure of AZT ([[zidovudine]]) in 1987, and people in developing countries today where very few individuals have access to these medications.<ref>[http://www.unaids.org/html/pub/publications/fact-sheets04/fs_treatment_en_pdf.pdf UNAIDS, 2003].</ref>

The NIAID reports that “in the mid-1980s, clinical trials enrolling patients with AIDS found that AZT given as single-drug therapy conferred a modest survival advantage compared [with] placebo. Among HIV-infected patients who had not yet developed AIDS, placebo-controlled trials found that AZT given as single-drug therapy delayed, for a year or two, the onset of AIDS-related illnesses. Significantly, long-term follow-up of these trials did not show a prolonged benefit of AZT, but also did not indicate that the drug increased disease progression or mortality. The lack of excess AIDS cases and death in the AZT arms of these placebo-controlled trials in effect counters the argument that AZT causes AIDS. Subsequent clinical trials found that patients receiving two-drug combinations had up to 50 percent improvements in time to progression to AIDS and in survival when compared with people receiving single-drug therapy. In more recent years, three-drug combination therapies have produced another 50 to 80 percent improvement in progression to AIDS and in survival when compared with two-drug regimens in clinical trials.”<ref>[http://www.hivatis.org/guidelines/adult/AA_040705.pdf HHS, 2005]</ref> "Use of potent anti-HIV combination therapies has contributed to dramatic reductions in the incidence of AIDS and AIDS-related deaths in populations where these drugs are widely available, an effect which clearly would not be seen if antiretroviral drugs caused AIDS."<ref name="niaid"/><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199803263381301 | last1 = Palella | first1 = FJ Jr | last2 = Delaney | first2 = KM | last3 = Moorman | first3 = AC | last4 = Loveless | first4 = MO | last5 = Fuhrer | first5 = J | last6 = Satten | first6 = GA | last7 = Aschman | first7 = DJ | last8 = Holmberg | first8 = SD. | year = 1998 | title = Declining morbidity and mortality among patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection.

===Opponents claim that nearly all HIV-positive people will develop AIDS===
Duesberg claims as support for his idea that many drug-free HIV-positive people have not yet developed AIDS; HIV/AIDS scientists note that many drug-free HIV-positive people have developed AIDS, and that, in the absence of medical treatment or rare genetic factors postulated to delay disease progression, it is very likely that nearly all HIV-positive people will eventually develop AIDS. Scientists also note that HIV-negative drug users do not suffer from immune system collapse.<ref name="drugusenature"/>
