The '''Dardanelles''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɑr|d|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|l|z}}; {{lang-tr|Çanakkale Boğazı}}, {{lang-el|Δαρδανέλλια, ''Dardanellia''}}), formerly known as '''Hellespont'''
({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|l|ɨ|s|p|ɒ|n|t}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἑλλήσποντος}}, ''Hellespontos'', literally "Sea of [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]]"), is a narrow [[strait]] in northwestern [[Turkey]] connecting the [[Aegean Sea]] to the [[Sea of Marmara]]. It is one of the [[Turkish Straits]], along with its counterpart, the [[Bosphorus]]. It is located at approximately {{coord|40|13|N|26|26|E|}}. The strait is {{convert|61|km|mi}} long but only {{convert|1.2|to|6|km|mi}} wide<!-- at this point the convert tag mucks up the text in the pop up views for users who are logged in-->, averaging {{convert|55|m|ft}} deep with a maximum depth of {{convert|103|m|ft}}.<ref>Nautical Chart at GeoHack-Dardanelles, Map Tech</ref> Water flows in both directions along the strait, from the Sea of Marmara to the Aegean via a [[surface current]] and in the opposite direction via an [[subsurface current|undercurrent]].

Like the [[Bosphorus]], it separates Europe (the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula) from the mainland of Asia ([[Anatolia]]). The strait is an [[international waterway]], and together with the Bosphorus, the Dardanelles connects the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

A suspension bridge project has been planned, connecting [[Sarıçay]] (a district of [[Çanakkale Province]]) on the Asian side to [[Kilitbahir]] on the European side. At this point, the strait is narrowest.<ref>http://www.botek.info/detay_motor_12.html</ref>

==Nomenclature==

The Turkish name ''Çanakkale Boğazı'' is derived from the major city adjoining the strait, [[Çanakkale]] (which takes its name from its famous [[castle]]s; ''kale'' means "castle"). 

The name ''Dardanelles'' derives from [[Dardania (Anatolia)|Dardania]], an ancient land on the Asian shore of the strait which in turn takes its name from [[Dardanus]], the mythical son of Zeus and Electra.

The [[Greek language|Greek]] name {{lang|grc|Ἑλλήσποντος}} (''Hellespontos'') means "Sea of Helle", and was the ancient name of the narrow strait. It was variously named in classical literature ''Hellespontium Pelagus'', ''Rectum Hellesponticum'', and ''Fretum Hellesponticum''. It was so called from [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], the daughter of Athamas, who was drowned here in the mythology of the [[Golden Fleece]].

==History==
The strait has often played a strategic role in history. The Dardanelles is unique in many respects. The very narrow and winding shape of the strait is more akin to that of a river. It is considered one of the most hazardous, crowded, difficult and potentially dangerous waterways in the world. The currents produced by the tidal action in the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara are such that ships under sail must await at anchorage for the right conditions before entering the Dardanelles.

===Greek and Persian history===
[[Image:Xerxes lash sea.JPG|thumb|right|An artist's illustration depicting Xerxes' alleged "punishment" of the Hellespont]]
The ancient city of [[Troy]] was located near the western entrance of the strait, and the strait's Asiatic shore was the focus of the [[Trojan War]]. Troy was able to control the marine traffic entering this vital waterway. The [[Persian Empire|Persian]] army of [[Xerxes I of Persia]] and later the Macedonian army of [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the Dardanelles in opposite directions to invade each other's lands, in 480 BC and 334 BC respectively. 

[[Herodotus]] tells us that, circa 482 BC, Xerxes I (the son of [[Darius the Great|Darius]]) had two [[pontoon bridge]]s built across the width of the Hellespont at [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]], in order that his huge army could cross from Persia into [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. This crossing was named by [[Aeschylus]] in his tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' as the cause of divine intervention against Xerxes.<ref>http://classics.mit.edu/Aeschylus/persians.html; the play.</ref>  

According to Herodotus (vv.34), both bridges were destroyed by a storm and [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] had those responsible for building the bridges beheaded and the strait itself whipped. [[The Histories of Herodotus]] vii.33–37 and vii.54–58 give details of building and crossing of [[Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges]]. Xerxes is then said to have thrown [[fetters]] into the strait, given it three hundred lashes and branded it with red-hot irons as the soldiers shouted at the water.<ref>Green, Peter ''The Greco-Persian Wars'' (London 1996) 75.</ref>

Herodotus commented that this was a "highly presumptuous way to address the Hellespont" but in no way atypical of Xerxes. (vii.35)

[[Harpalus (engineer)|Harpalus the engineer]] eventually helped the invading armies to cross by lashing the ships together with their bows facing the current and, so it is said, two additional anchors.

===Greek mythology===

[[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], the daughter of Athamas, was drowned here in the legend of the [[Golden Fleece]].

It was the scene of the legend of [[Hero and Leander]]. Leander swam the strait in order to tryst with his beloved, the priestess Hero.

===Byzantine history===
The Dardanelles were vital to the defence of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period.
[[File:Byzantine Dardanelles Customs Law.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Marble plate with 6th century AD law regulating payment of customs in the Dardanelles]]
Also, the Dardanelles was an important source of income for the ruler of the region. At the Istanbul Archaeological Museum a marble plate contains a law by the [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I]] (491–518 AD), that regulated fees for passage through the customs office of the Dardanelles (see image to the right). Translation:

<blockquote>... Whoever dares to violate these regulations shall no longer be regarded as a friend, and he shall be punished. Besides, the administrator of the Dardanelles must have the right to receive 50 golden Litrons, so that these rules, which we make out of piety, shall never ever be violated... ... The distinguished governor and major of the capital, who already has both hands full of things to do, has turned to our lofty piety in order to reorganize the entry and exit of all ships through the Dardanelles... ... Starting from our day and also in the future, anybody who wants to pass through the Dardanelles must pay the following: <br />
– All wine merchants who bring wine to the capital (Constantinopolis), except [[Cilicia]]ns, have to pay the Dardanelles officials 6 [[follis]] and 2 [[sextarius]] of wine. <br />
– In the same manner, all merchants of olive-oil, vegetables and lard must pay the Dardanelles officials 6 follis. Cilician sea-merchants have to pay 3 follis and in addition to that, 1 keration (12 follis) to enter, and 2 keration to exit.<br />
– All wheat merchants have to pay the officials 3 follis per modius, and a further sum of 3 follis when leaving.</blockquote>

Since the 14th century the Dardanelles have almost continuously been controlled by the Turks.

===Modern history===
[[File:Dardanelles and Gulf of Saros by Piri Reis.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Historic map of Dardanelles by [[Piri Reis]]]]

====Nineteenth century====
Gaining control or special access to the strait became a key foreign policy goal of the [[Russian Empire]] during the 19th century. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Russia—supported by [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] in the [[Dardanelles Operation]]—[[Battle of the Dardanelles (1807)|blockaded the straits]] in 1807. Following the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29]], in 1833 Russia pressured the Ottomans to sign the [[Treaty of Hunkiar Iskelesi]]—which required the straits to be closed to warships of non-Black Sea powers at Russia's request. That would have effectively given Russia a free hand in the Black Sea. 

That treaty alarmed the losers,{{clarify|date=April 2012}}<!--it is unclear who the losers are. The Ottomans?--> who were concerned that the consequences of potential Russian expansionism in the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions could conflict with their own possessions and economic interest in the regions. At the [[London Straits Convention]] in July 1841, the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Austria]], and [[Prussia]] pressured Russia to agree that only Turkish warships could traverse the Dardanelles in peacetime. The United Kingdom and France subsequently sent their fleets through the straits to attack the [[Crimean Peninsula]] during the [[Crimean War]] in 1853—but this was done as allies of the Ottoman Empire. That convention was formally reaffirmed by the [[Congress of Paris]] in 1856, following the Russian defeat in the Crimean War. It remained technically in force into the 20th and 21st centuries.

====World War I====
{{Main|Gallipoli Campaign}}
In 1915, the western Allies sent a massive invasion force of British, Indian, Australian, and New Zealand troops to attempt to open up the strait. At the [[Gallipoli campaign]], Turkish troops trapped the Allies on the beaches of the Gallipoli peninsula. The campaign results did damage to the career of Sir [[Winston Churchill]], then the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], who eagerly promoted the use of [[Royal Navy]] sea power to force open the straits. [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], later founder of the [[Republic_of_Turkey#Republic_era|Republic of Turkey]], was a commander for the Ottomans during the battle. 

The straits were mined by the Turks to prevent Allied ships from penetrating them, but in minor actions, two submarines, one British and one Australian, did succeed in penetrating the minefields. The British one sank an obsolete Turkish [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] off the [[Golden Horn]] of Istanbul. [[Sir Ian Hamilton]]'s [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] was unsuccessful in its attempt to capture the Gallipoli peninsula, and its withdrawal was ordered in January 1916, after 10 months' fighting. Total Allied deaths were 43,000 British, 15,000 French, 8,700 Australians, 2,700 New Zealanders and 1,370 Indians. Total Turkish deaths were around 60,000.

====Western occupation====
{{Main|Occupation of Constantinople|Chanak Crisis}}
Following the war, the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]] demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the [[League of Nations]]. This was amended after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]] under the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]] which restored the straits to Turkey but allowed all foreign warships to traverse the straits freely. Turkey rejected the terms of this treaty and subsequently remilitarized the area. The reversion to this old regime was formalized under the [[Montreux Convention]] of July 1936. The convention, which is still technically in force today, treats the straits as an international shipping lane, but Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non–[[Black Sea]] nations (like [[Greece]] or [[Algeria]]).

====Later====
[[File:ChanakkaleFerry.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Ferry]] line across the Dardanelles in [[Çanakkale]]]]
During [[World War II]], through February 1945, when Turkey was neutral for most of the length of the conflict, the Dardanelles were closed to the ships of the belligerent nations. Turkey declared war on Germany in February 1945, but it did not employ any offensive forces during the war.

==Economy==

Historically Dardanelles has mined [[lead]]. As of 1914, a mine was producing it.<ref name=Prothero103>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=103|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/103/}}</ref>
