'''Anguilla''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|w|ɪ|l|ə}} {{respell|ang|GWIL|ə}}) is a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]] in the [[Caribbean]].<ref name="Introduction ::Anguilla">{{cite web|title=Introduction ::Anguilla|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/av.html}}</ref> It is one of the most northerly of the [[Leeward Islands]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]], lying east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]] and directly north of [[Saint Martin]]. The territory consists of the main island of Anguilla itself, approximately 16 miles (26&nbsp;km) long by 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) wide at its widest point, together with a number of much smaller islands and [[cay]]s with no permanent population. The island's capital is [[The Valley, Anguilla|The Valley]]. The total land area of the territory is 35 square miles (90&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>),<ref name="facts">{{cite web|title=Anguilla Facts|url=http://www.gov.ai/anguillafacts.php|publisher=Government of Anguilla|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> with a population of approximately 13,500 (2006 estimate).

Anguilla has become a popular [[tax haven]], having no capital gains, estate, profit or other forms of direct taxation on either individuals or corporations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tax Rates |url=http://www.taxrates.cc/html/anguilla-tax-rates.html |title=Anguilla Tax Rates |publisher=Taxrates.cc |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> In April 2011, faced with a mounting deficit, it introduced a 3% "Interim Stabilisation Levy", Anguilla's first form of income tax.<ref>{{cite web|author=KPMG |url=http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxation-international-executives/anguilla/pages/default.aspx|title=Tax TIES: Anguilla - Overview and introduction |publisher=KPMG |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Anguilla derives from the word for "eel" in any of various [[Romance language]]s (modern Spanish: ''{{lang|es|anguila}}''; French: ''{{lang|fr|anguille}}''; Italian: ''{{lang|it|anguilla}}''; Portuguese: ''{{lang|pt|enguia}}''; Romanian ''{{lang|ro|anghilă}}''<ref>[http://dexonline.ro/definitie/anghilă Dictionary of the Romanian language]</ref>), probably chosen because of the island's eel-like shape.

==History==
{{Main|History of Anguilla}}
[[File:Wallblake House, The Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Wallblake House]]]]
Anguilla was first settled by [[Amerindian]] tribes who migrated from South America. The earliest Amerindian artifacts found on Anguilla have been dated to around 1300 BC, and remains of settlements date from 600 AD.<ref>''Caribbean Islands'', Sarah Cameron (Footprint Travel Guides), p. 466 ([http://books.google.com/?id=G74-rZzX64cC Google Books])</ref> The date of European discovery is uncertain: some sources claim that [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] sighted the island in 1493, while others state that the island was first discovered by the French in 1564 or 1565.<ref>[http://www.gov.ai/elections/anguillahistory.htm Anguilla's History], Government of Anguilla website</ref> 

Anguilla was first colonised by [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlers from [[Saint Kitts]], beginning in 1650.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Historical Geography of the British Colonies: The West Indies|author=Charles Prestwood Lucas|page=143|isbn=978-1-4590-0868-7|publisher=General Books LLC|year=2009}}</ref> The French temporarily took over the island in 1666 but under the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] it was returned to English control. In this early colonial period Anguilla sometimes served as a place of refuge. A Major John Scott who visited in September 1667 wrote of leaving the island "in good condition" and noted that in July 1668 "200 or 300 people fled thither in time of war."<ref>British Colonial and State Papers 1661-1668, 16 November 1667 and 9 July 1668.</ref> Other early arrivals included Europeans from [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]]. 

It is likely that some of these early Europeans brought enslaved Africans with them. Historians confirm that [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] lived in the region in the early 17th century. For example, Africans from [[Senegal]] lived in St. Christopher (today St. Kitts) in 1626. By 1672 a slave depot existed on the island of Nevis, serving the [[Leeward Islands]]. While the time of African arrival in Anguilla is difficult to place precisely, archival evidence indicates a substantial African presence (at least 100) on the island by 1683.

While traditional histories of the region assume that the English were the first settlers of Anguilla under British rule, recent scholarship focused on Anguilla offers a different view. It places more significance on early sociocultural diversity. The research suggested that St. Christopher,<ref>Cooper, V.O.  1998.  St. Kitts:  The Launching Pad for Leeward Islands Creoles.  In St.  Kitts and the Atlantic Creoles, the Texts of Samuel Augustus Mathews in Perspective, P. Baker and A. Bruyn (eds.).  London:  University of Westminster Press.</ref> Barbados, Nevis and Antigua may have been important points of origin.  Regarding African origins, West Africa as well as Central Africa are both posited as the ancestral homelands of some of Anguilla's early African population.<ref name="Walicek, Don E 2009. pp. 349-372">Walicek, Don E.  2009.  "The Founder Principle and Anguilla's Homestead Society," Gradual Creolization: Studies Celebrating Jacques Arends, ed. by M. van den Berg, H. Cardoso, and R. Selbach.  (Creole Language Library Series 34), Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 349-372.</ref>

During the early colonial period, Anguilla was administered by the British through Antigua, but in 1824 it was placed under the administrative control of nearby Saint Kitts. In 1967, Britain granted Saint Kitts and [[Nevis]] full internal autonomy, and Anguilla was also incorporated into the new unified dependency, named [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]], against the wishes of many Anguillians. This led to two rebellions in 1967 and 1969 (Anguillian Revolution), headed by [[Ronald Webster]], and a brief period as a [[Republic of Anguilla|self-declared independent republic]]. The goal of the revolution was not independence per se, but rather independence from Saint Kitts and Nevis, and a return to being a British colony.  British authority was fully restored in July 1971, and in 1980 Anguilla was finally allowed to secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis and become a separate British [[Crown colony]] (now a [[British overseas territory]]).<ref name="Introduction ::Anguilla"/>

== Governance ==
===Political system===
{{Main|Politics of Anguilla}}
{{See also|Law of Anguilla}}
Anguilla is an internally self-governing [[British overseas territory|overseas territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Its politics take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]], whereby the [[Chief Minister]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The [[United Nations Committee on Decolonization]] includes Anguilla on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]]. The territory's constitution is Anguilla Constitutional Order 1 April 1982 (amended 1990). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Anguilla House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. {{clear left}}

===Defence===
As a dependency of the UK, the UK is responsible for its military defence, although there are no active [[garrison]] or armed forces present.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Anguilla}}
[[File:Anguilla-aerial view western portion.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial view of the western portion of the island of Anguilla. The Blowing Point ferry terminal is visible in the lower right, as are (right to left) Shaddick Point, Rendezvous Bay, Cove Bay, and Maundays Bay.]]

Anguilla is a flat, low-lying island of [[coral]] and [[limestone]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. It is directly north of [[Saint Martin]], separated from that island by the [[Anguilla Channel]]. The [[soil]] is generally thin and poor, supporting  [[scrubland|scrub]] [[tropical]] and [[forest]] vegetation.

Anguilla is noted for its spectacular and ecologically important [[coral reef]]s and beaches. Apart from the main island of Anguilla itself, the territory includes a number of other smaller islands and [[cays]], mostly tiny and uninhabited. Some of these are:
* [[Anguillita]]
* [[Dog Island, Anguilla|Dog Island]]
* [[Prickly Pear Cays]]
* [[Sandy Island, Anguilla|Sandy Island]]
* [[Scrub Island, Anguilla|Scrub Island]]
* [[Scilly Cay, Anguilla|Scilly Cay]]
* [[Seal Island, Anguilla|Seal Island]]
* [[Sombrero, Anguilla|Sombrero]], also known as Hat Island

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Anguilla}}

===Temperature===
Northeastern trade winds keep this tropical island relatively cool and dry. Average annual temperature is 80°F (27°C).<ref name="facts" /> July–October is its hottest period, December–February, its coolest.

===Rainfall===
Rainfall averages 35 inches (890&nbsp;mm) annually,<ref name="facts" /> although the figures vary from season to season and year to year. The island is subject to both sudden tropical storms and hurricanes, which occur in the period from July to November. The island suffered damage in 1995 from [[Hurricane Luis]] and severe flooding 5–20 feet from [[Hurricane Lenny]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Anguilla}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Anguilla.jpeg|thumb|300px|2009 export percentages]]

Anguilla's thin arid soil is largely unsuitable for agriculture, and the island has few land-based [[natural resources]]. Its main industries are tourism, [[offshore companies|offshore incorporation and management]], [[offshore bank]]ing, [[captive insurance]] and fishing.          

Before the 2008 world-wide crisis the economy of Anguilla was expanding rapidly, especially the tourism sector which was driving major new developments in partnerships with multi-national companies.

Anguilla's currency is the [[East Caribbean dollar]], though the [[US dollar]] is also widely accepted. The exchange rate is fixed to the US dollar at US$1 = EC$2.68.

The economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects of [[Hurricane Luis]] in September but recovered in 1996. Hotels were hit particularly hard during this time. Another economic setback occurred during the aftermath of [[Hurricane Lenny]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=South America, Central America and the Caribbean 2003|publisher=Routledge|page=52|year=2002|isbn=978-1-85743-138-4|edition=11}}</ref>

In 2011 Anguilla became the fifth largest jurisdiction for [[Captive Insurance]], behind Bermuda, Cayman, Vermont and Guernsey. The captive insurance industry plays an ever increasing and important part of Anguilla's financial services industry. Captive management firms have staffed offices in Anguilla in order to service the fast growing captive insurance industry. 

Anguilla aims to obtain 15% of its energy from [[solar power]] so it is less reliant on expensive imported diesel. The [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]] is helping the government gather the information it needs to change the territory's legislation, so it can integrate renewables into its grid. [[Barbados]], have also made good progress in switching to renewables, but many other SIDS are still at the early stages of planning how to integrate renewable energy into their grids. “For a small island we’re very far ahead,” said Beth Barry, Coordinator of the Anguilla Renewable Energy Office. "We’ve got an Energy Policy and a draft Climate Change policy and have been focussing efforts on the question of [[sustainable energy]] supply for several years now. As a result we have a lot of information we can share with other islands.”<ref>Fry, Carolyn. 28 June 2012. [http://cdkn.org/2012/06/interview-with-beth-barry-on-anguilla-renewable-energy/ Anguilla moves towards cleaner energy]</ref>

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transport in Anguilla}}

===Air===
Anguilla is served by [[Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport]] (prior to 4 July 2010 known as Wallblake Airport). The primary runway at the airport is {{convert|5462|ft|m}} in length and can accommodate moderate-sized aircraft. Services connect to various other Caribbean islands via regional carrier [[LIAT]], local charter airlines and others. Although there are no direct scheduled flights to or from continental America or Europe, [[Tradewind Aviation]] and [[Cape Air]] provide scheduled air service to San Juan, Puerto Rico. The airport can handle large [[narrow-body]] jets such as the [[Boeing 727]], [[Boeing 737]] and [[Boeing 757]].

===Road===
Aside from taxis, there is no public transport on the island. Cars drive on the left.

===Boat===
[[File:Anguilla Ferry Arrivals.jpg|thumb|right|Ferry Terminal, Blowing Point]]
There are regular ferries from [[Saint Martin]] to Anguilla. It is a 20 minute crossing from [[Marigot, Saint Martin|Marigot]], St. Martin to Blowing Point, Anguilla. Ferries commence service from 7:00&nbsp;am. There is also a Charter Service, from [[Blowing Point]], Anguilla to [[Princess Juliana Airport]] to make travel easier. This way of travel is the most common method of transport between Anguilla and St. Martin or St. Maarten.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Anguilla}}
The majority of residents (90.08%) are black, the descendants of slaves transported from Africa. Growing minorities include whites at 3.74% and people of mixed race at 4.65% (figures from 2001 census).

72% of the population is Anguillian while 28% is non-Anguillian (2001 census). Of the non-Anguillian population, many are citizens of the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[St Kitts & Nevis]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Nigeria]].

2006 and 2007 saw an influx of large numbers of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[India]]n, and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] workers, brought in as labour for major tourist developments due to the local population not being large enough to support the labour requirements.

==Culture==
[[File:Cap Juluca - Anguilla.jpg|thumb|right|The beach at the Cap Juluca resort on Maundays Bay]]
[[File:Anguilla-Island Harbour.jpg|thumb|right|Island Harbour]]
The [[Anguilla National Trust]] (ANT) was established in 1988 and opened its offices in 1993 charged with the responsibility of preserving the heritage of the island, including its cultural heritage. The Trust has programmes encouraging Anguillian writers and the preservation of the island's history.

The island's cultural history begins with the [[Taíno people|Taino]] Indians. Artifacts have been found around the island, telling of life before European settlers arrived.

As throughout the [[Caribbean]], holidays are a cultural fixture. Anguilla's most important holidays are of historic as much as cultural importance &ndash; particularly the anniversary of the emancipation (previously August Monday in the Park), celebrated as the Summer Festival. [[United Kingdom|British]] festivities, such as the [[Queen's Official Birthday|Queen's birthday]], are also celebrated.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Anguillan cuisine}}
Anguillan cuisine is influenced by native Caribbean, African, Spanish, French and English cuisines.<ref name="UsaToday">Robinson, Peg.

===Language===
{{Main|Anguillan Creole}}
[[File:Sandy Ground Anguilla.jpg|thumb|Overlooking [[Sandy Ground, Anguilla|Sandy Ground]], Anguilla]]
Today most people in Anguilla speak a British-influenced variety of "Standard" English. Other languages are also spoken on the island, including varieties of Spanish, Chinese and the languages of other immigrants. However, the most common language other than Standard English is the island's own English-lexifier Creole language (not to be confused with French Creole spoken in islands such as Haiti, Martinique, and Guadeloupe). It is referred to locally by terms such as "dialect" (pronounced "dialek"), Anguilla Talk, or "Anguillian". It has its main roots in early varieties of English and West African languages, and is similar to the dialects spoken in English-speaking islands throughout the Eastern Caribbean, in terms of its structural features and to the extent of being considered one single language.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aig Ethnologue report for language code: aig]</ref>

Linguists who are interested in the origins of Anguillian and other Caribbean Creoles point out that some of its grammatical features can be traced to African languages while others can be traced to European languages. Three areas have been identified as significant for the identification of the linguistic origins of those forced migrants who arrived before 1710: the Gold Coast, the Slave Coast, and the Windward Coast.<ref>Singler, John.  1993.  African influence upon Afro-American language varieties: A consideration of sociohistorical factors.  In Africanisms in Afro-American language varieties, S. Mufwene and n. Condon (eds.), 235-253.  Athens, GA:  University of Georgia Press.</ref>

Sociohistorical information from Anguilla's archives suggest that Africans and Europeans formed two distinct, but perhaps overlapping speech communities in the early phases of the island's colonisation. "Anguillian" is believed to have emerged as the language of the masses as time passed, slavery was abolished, and locals began to see themselves as "belonging" to Anguillian society.<ref name="Walicek, Don E 2009. pp. 349-372"/>

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Anguilla}}

===Religion===
Religion is another aspect of Anguilla's cultural history.  The Christian Church did not have a consistent or strong presence across the initial period of English colonization; during this period the spiritual and religious practices of Europeans and Africans tended to reflect their regional origins.  However, it should be noted that some Africans are likely to have encountered Christianity prior to their immigration to the island, in West Africa as well as on other Caribbean islands.   As early as 1813 Christian ministers formally ministered to enslaved Africans and promoted literacy in English among converts.<ref>Walicek, Don E.  2011. "Christianity, Literacy, and Creolization in Nineteenth-Century Anguilla." In 	Anansi's Defiant Webs, Contact, Continuity, Convergence, and Complexity in the Language, 	Literatures and Cultures of the Greater Caribbean, ed. by N. Faraclas, R. Severing, et al. Willemstad: University of Curaçao and Fundashon pa Planifikashon di Idioma, pp. 181-189.</ref> The Wesleyan Missionary Society of England built churches and schools in 1817.<ref>Hodge, S. Wilfred (2003).  Bethel- the road - and due west.  In Wilbert Forker (Ed.), Born in slavery:  A story of Methodism in Anguilla and its influence in the Caribbean (pp. 20-29). Edinburgh: Dunedin Academic Press.</ref> 

According to the 2001 census, [[Christianity]] is Anguilla's predominant religion, with 36.6 percent of the population practising [[Anglicanism|Anglicanism (including Episcopalianism)]]. Another 23.9 percent are [[Methodist]]. Other churches on the island include [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Baptist]], [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (0.7%).<ref name="statistics census">{{cite web|url=http://gov.ai/statistics/census/Demography%20&%20Culture%20tables.htm|title=Persons by Religion, Census 1992 and 2001 (Table 14)|publisher=Statistics Department of Anguilla|accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref> Between 1992 and 2001 the number of followers of the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]] and [[Pentecostal Churches]] increased considerably. There are at least 15 churches on the island, several of architectural interest. Although a minority on the island, it is an important location to followers of [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] religion – Anguilla is the birthplace of [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]], author of [[Holy Piby|The Holy Piby]] which has had a strong influence on Rastafarian beliefs. Various other religions are practised as well.<ref name="statistics census"/>

===Sport===
[[File:Sailing-in-anguilla.jpg|thumb|right|A modern [[square rigger]] viewed from Long Bay]]
{{See also|Sailing in Anguilla|Cricket in the West Indies|Rugby union in Anguilla}}
[[Boat]] [[racing]] has deep roots in Anguillian culture, and is the [[national sport]]. There are regular sailing [[regattas]] on national holidays, such as Carnival, which are contested by locally built and designed boats. These boats have names and have sponsors that print their logo on their sails.
