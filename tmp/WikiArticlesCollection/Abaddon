The Hebrew term '''''Abaddon''''' ({{lang-he|אֲבַדּוֹן}}, ''{{lang|he-Latn|'Ǎḇaddōn}}''), and its Greek equivalent '''''Apollyon''''' ({{lang-gr|Ἀπολλύων}}, ''Apollyon''), appear in the [[Bible]] as a place of destruction and an [[angel]], respectively. In the [[Hebrew Bible]], ''abaddon'' is used with reference to a dwelling place of the dead, often appearing alongside the better-known term שאול (''[[sheol]]''). In the New Testament [[Book of Revelation]], an angel called Abaddon is shown as the king of an army of [[locust]]s; his name is first transcribed in Greek (Revelation 9:11 – "whose name in Hebrew Abaddon" (Ἀβαδδὼν)), and then translated ("which in Greek means the Destroyer" (Ἀπολλύων, ''Apollyon'')). The Latin [[Vulgate]], as well as the [[Douay Rheims Bible]], has an additional note (not present in the Greek text), "in Latin Exterminans", ''exterminans'' being the Latin word for "destroyer".

===Etymology===
According to the [[Brown Driver Briggs]] lexicon, the Hebrew ''abaddon'' (Hebrew: אבדון; avadon) is an intensive form of the [[Semitic root]] and verb stem ''abad'' (אָבַד) "perish" (transitive "destroy"), which occurs 184 times in the Hebrew Bible. The [[Septuagint]], an early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, renders "abaddon" as "ἀπώλεια,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studylight.org/com/jab/view.cgi?bk=65&ch=9|title=Johann Albrecht Bengel's Gnomon of the New Testament|last=Bengel|first=Johann Albrecht|accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref> while the Greek ''Apollyon'' comes from 'apollumi'' ([[:wikt:ἀπόλλυμι|ἀπόλλυμι]]) "to destroy."

===Hebrew Bible===
The term ''abaddon'' appears six times in the [[Masoretic text]] of the Hebrew Bible; ''abaddon'' means destruction or "place of destruction", or the realm of the dead, and is associated with [[Sheol]]. 
* [[Book of Job|Job]] 26:6: the grave (Sheol) is naked before Him, and destruction (Abaddon) has no covering.
* Job 28:22: destruction (Abaddon) and death say...
* Job 31:12: it is a fire that consumes to destruction (Abaddon)...
* [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] 88:11: Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave (Sheol) or thy faithfulness in destruction (Abaddon)?
* [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:11: Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are before the LORD, how much more than the hearts of the children of men?
* Proverbs 27:20: Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. ([[Authorised King James Version|KJV]], 1611)

===Second Temple era texts===
The text of the [[Thanksgiving Hymns]] – which was found in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] – tells of "the Sheol of Abaddon" and of the "torrents of [[Belial]] [that] burst into Abaddon". The ''[[Pseudo-Philo|Biblical Antiquities]]'' (misattributed to [[Philo]]) mentions Abaddon as a place (''sheol'', hell), not as a spirit or demon or angel. Abaddon is also one of the compartments of [[Gehenna]].<ref name="oxford">Metzger & Coogan (1993) ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', p3.</ref> By extension, it can mean an underworld abode of lost souls, or [[Hell]].

===Rabbinical literature===
In some legends, Abaddon is identified as a realm where the "[[Damnation|damned]]" lie in fire and snow, one of the places in "[[Hell]]" that [[Moses]] visited.<ref name ="Ginzberg">''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj206.htm The Legends of the Jews, volume II: From Joseph to Exodus]'', Lewis Ginzberg, 1909.</ref>

==Christianity==
===Etymology===
The Greek term "the Destroyer" ([[Apollyon]], [[:wikt:Ἀπολλύων|Ἀπολλύων]]) is the [[active participle]] of ''apollumi'' ([[:wikt:ἀπόλλυμι|ἀπόλλυμι]]) "to destroy".<ref>{{cite web|title=ἀπόλλυμι destroy utterly, kill,|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29po%2Flluwn&la=greek|work=Perseus Digital Library|publisher=Perseus Digital Library Project|accessdate=4 June 2012|author=Gregory R.

===New Testament===
The [[Scriptures#Christianity|Christian scriptures]] contain the first known depiction of ''Abaddon'' as an individual entity instead of a place.

===Christian tradition===
In the 3rd century ''[[Acts of Thomas]]'', Abaddon is the name of a demon, or the [[Devil]] himself. 

Abaddon is given particularly important roles in two sources, a homily entitled "The Enthronement of Abbaton" by pseudo-[[Timothy of Alexandria]], and the [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)|Apocalypse of Bartholomew]].<ref name=Aziz>[[Atiya, Aziz S.]] ''[[The Coptic Encyclopedia]].'' New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1991. ISBN 0-02-897025-X</ref> In the homily by Timothy, Abbaton was first named ''Muriel'', and had been given the task by [[God]] of collecting the earth which would be used in the creation of [[Adam]]. Upon completion of this task, the angel was then named to be guardian. Everyone, including the angels, demons, and corporeal entities, felt fear of him. Abbaton engaged in prayer and ultimately obtained the promise that any men who venerated him during their lifetime stood the chance of being saved. Abbaton is also said to have a prominent role in the [[Last Judgement]], as the one who will take the souls to the [[Valley of Josaphat]].<ref name=Aziz/> He is described in the Apocalypse of Bartholomew as being present in the [[Tomb of Jesus]] at the moment of his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].<ref>[http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/LostBooks/bartholomew.htm Gospel of Bartholomew] Featured as Abbaton</ref>

===Protestant commentators===
The symbolism of Revelation 9:11 leaves the exact identification of Abaddon open for interpretation. [[Matthew Henry]] (1708) believed Abaddon to be the [[antichrist]],<ref name="henry">[http://www.blueletterbible.org/commentaries/comm_view.cfm?AuthorID=4&contentID=1868&commInfo=5&topic=Revelation Blue Letter Bible – Commentaries – Matthew Henry – Matthew Henry Commentary on the Whole Bible]</ref> while the [[Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Commentary]] (1871) and [[Henry H. Halley]] (1922) identified the angel as Satan.<ref name="jfb">[http://www.blueletterbible.org/commentaries/comm_view.cfm?AuthorID=7&contentID=3105&commInfo=6&topic=Revelation Blue Letter Bible – Commentaries – Jamieson, Fausset & Brown – Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible]</ref><ref name="halley">Halley (1922) ''Halley's Bible Handbook with the New International Version'', p936.</ref><ref name="bbc">[[William MacDonald (Christian author)]] (1995) ''Believer's Bible Commentary'', p2366.</ref>

The International Bible Students Association (precursor to the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]) identified Abaddon as Satan in the 1917 seventh and final volume of ''[[Millennial Dawn]]''.<ref>[[Charles Taze Russell]]’s ''[[Studies in the Scriptures]]'', vol. 7, p. 159, 1917 edition</ref> Jehovah's Witnesses now take the contrasting view, believing that Abaddon is another name of the resurrected and enthroned Jesus Christ.<ref>Insight on the Scriptures Page 12</ref><ref>Watchtower, 1 December 1961, p. 719</ref>
