{{info|This project is inactive. For a similar effort, see [[WP:LOCPROJ]].}}
Here's a list of the countries with info on [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/ the Dept of State site].  The information at this site is in the public domain ''unless it explicitly says otherwise'' on whatever page you are viewing there.'' 

The CIA site and the Dept of State site don't cover all of the countries; each of them is missing info on various countries; also they are not in agreement on what name to link to the countries under--that is the source of the various anachronisms on the [[List of countries]] page.  Furthermore, they are not always in agreement on various figures including population and GDP, even (on occasion) when supposedly taken from the same year.  If you notice a discrepancy, it's probably best to use the more cautious figure.

[[user:-- April]] suggested adding bits on contentious relationships between countries, including e.g. the U.S. and Afghanistan, but not including the more U.S.-centric bits about countries with amicable relations (e.g. location of U.S. embassies in Jamaica, Ireland, etc.)
