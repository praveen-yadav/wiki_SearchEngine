In [[Greek mythology]], '''Aegeus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|dʒ|ˌ|j|uː|s}}; {{lang-grc|Αἰγεύς}}) or '''Aegeas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|dʒ|i|ə|s}}; {{lang|el|Αιγέας}}), was an archaic figure in the [[founding myth]] of [[Athens]]. The "goat-man" who gave his name to the [[Aegean Sea]] was, next to [[Poseidon]], the father of [[Theseus]], the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the [[kings of Athens]].

==The myth==

===His reign===
Upon the death of the king, [[Pandion II]], Aegeus and his three brothers, [[Pallas (son of Pandion)|Pallas]], [[Nisos]], and [[Lycus (mythology)|Lykos]], took control of Athens from [[Metion]], who had seized the throne from Pandion. They divided the government in four and Aegeus became king.

Aegeus' first wife was [[Meta]],<ref>Compare [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]].</ref> and his second wife was [[Chalciope]]. Still without a male heir, Aegeus asked the [[Pythia|oracle]] at [[Delphi]] for advice. Her cryptic words were "Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief."<ref>Plutarch, ''Vita of Theseus''; Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3,15.6.</ref> Aegeus did not understand the prophecy and was disappointed.

This puzzling oracle forced Aegeus to visit [[Pittheus]], king of [[Troezen]], who was famous for his wisdom and skill at expounding oracles. Pittheus understood the prophecy and introduced Aegeus to his daughter, [[Aethra (Greek mythology)|Aethra]], when Aegeus was drunk.<ref>[[Scholium|Scholion]] on Euripides' ''Hippolytus'', noted by Karl Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (1959) p 218 note 407.</ref> They lay with each other, and then in some versions, Aethra waded to the island of [[Sphairia]] (aka Calauria) and bedded [[Poseidon]]. When Aethra became pregnant, Aegeus decided to return to Athens. Before leaving, he buried his sandals, shield, and sword under a huge rock and told her that, when their son grew up, he should move the rock and bring the weapons to his father, who would acknowledge him. Upon his return to Athens, Aegeus married [[Medea]], who had fled from [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] and the wrath of [[Jason]]. Aegeus and Medea had one son named [[Medus]].

===Conflict with Crete===

While visiting in Athens, King [[Minos]]' son, [[Androgeus]] managed to defeat Aegeus in every contest during the [[Panathenaic Games]]. Out of jealousy, Aegeus sent him to conquer the [[Marathonian Bull]], which killed him.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.15.7. The identification of the festival as the [[Panathenaia]] is an interpolated anachronism.</ref> Minos was angry and declared war on Athens. He offered the Athenians peace, however, under the condition that Athens would send [[sacrificial victims of Minotaur|seven young men and seven young women]] every nine years to [[Crete]] to be fed to the [[Minotaur]], a vicious monster. This continued until Theseus killed the Minotaur with the help of [[Ariadne]], Minos' daughter.

===Theseus and the Minotaur===
{{main|Theseus}}
In Troezen, Theseus grew up and became a brave young man. He managed to move the rock and took his father's weapons. His mother then told him the identity of his father and that he should take the weapons back to him at Athens and be acknowledged. Theseus decided to go to Athens and had the choice of going by sea, which was the safe way, or by land, following a dangerous path with thieves and bandits all the way. Young, brave and ambitious, Theseus decided to go to Athens by land.

When Theseus arrived, he did not reveal his true identity. He was welcomed by Aegeus, who was suspicious about the stranger who came to Athens. Medea tried to have Theseus killed by encouraging Aegeus to ask him to capture the [[Marathonian Bull]], but Theseus succeeded. She tried to poison him, but at the last second, Aegeus recognized his son and knocked the poisoned cup out of Theseus' hand. Father and son were thus reunited, and Medea was sent away to [[Asia]].<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, Epitome of the ''[[Bibliotheke]]'', 1.5–7; [[First Vatican Mythographer]], 48.</ref>

Theseus departed for Crete.  Upon his departure, Aegeus told him to put up white sails when returning if he was successful in killing the Minotaur. However, when Theseus returned, he forgot these instructions.  When Aegeus saw the black sails coming into Athens, he jumped into the sea and drowned, mistaken in his belief that his son had been slain.<ref>Diodorus Siculus 4.61.4; Plutarch, ''Vita of Theseus'' 17 and 22; Pausanias 1.22.5; Catullus 64.215–245; Hyginus, ''Fabula'' 41, 43; Servius on the ''Aeneid'' 3.74.</ref> Henceforth, this sea was known as the [[Aegean Sea]].

[[Sophocles]]' tragedy ''Aegeus'' has been lost, but Aegeus features in [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]''.

==Legacy==
At Athens, the traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was informed in the second-century CE that the cult of [[Aphrodite Urania]] above the [[Kerameikos]] was so ancient that it had been established by Aegeus, whose sisters were barren, and he still childless himself.<ref>Pausanias, 1.14.6.</ref>
