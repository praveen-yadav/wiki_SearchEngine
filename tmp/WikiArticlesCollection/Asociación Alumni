'''Asociación Alumni''', usually just '''Alumni''', is a [[rugby union]] and former [[Association football|football]] club located in [[Tortuguitas]], [[Greater Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].

==History==

===The beginning===
{{Main|Alumni Athletic Club}}
The club was originally founded as a football team in 1891, with the name "English High School" (the school where they came from) although it was obliged to change its name to "Alumni Athletic Club" (the name was proposed by a former student of the [[Buenos Aires English High School|English High School]]) in 1901.

Alumni was the most successful team in the [[amateur era of Argentine football]], winning 10 of the 14 league championships contested, being considered the first great football team.<ref name=clarin>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/04/24/d-549894.htm "En el nombre del fútbol", ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' newspaper, 2003-04-24]</ref> Alumni was reorganised in 1908, "in order to encourage people to practise all kind of sports, specially football". This was the last try to develop itself as a sports club rather than just a football team, such as Lomas, Belgrano and [[Quilmes Atlético Club|Quilmes]] had successfully done in the past, but the efforts were not enough. Alumni played its last game in 1911 and was definitely dissolved on April 24, 1913.

===Rebirth through rugby===
In 1951 a group of English High School alumni asked the school for permission to re-establish the name "Alumni" for a rugby team. This request was immediately approved in a meeting presided by Carlos Bowers, who had proposed the name "Alumni" to the original football team 50 years before.<ref>[http://www.asociacionalumni.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6&Itemid=71 "Los comienzos de Alumni" - club's official website]</ref>

The team achieved good results and in 1960 the club presented a team that won the third division of the [[Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires league]], reaching the second division. Since then, Alumni has played at the highest level of Argentinian rugby and its rivalry with [[Belgrano Athletic Club]] is one of the fiercest [[Local derby|local derbies]] in [[Buenos Aires]]. Alumni would later climb up to first division winning 5 titles: 4 consecutive between 1989 and 1992, and the other in 2001.

In 2002, Alumni won its first [[Nacional de Clubes]] title, defeating [[Jockey Club de Rosario]] 23-21 in the final.
