The '''Balfour Declaration of 1926''', issued by the [[1926 Imperial Conference]] of [[British Empire]] leaders in London, was named for [[Lord President of the Council]] (and former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]) [[Arthur Balfour]]. It declared the United Kingdom and the [[Dominion]]s to be
{{quote|<!--They are -->autonomous Communities within the [[British Empire]], equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to [[the Crown]], and freely associated as members of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].}}

The Inter-Imperial Relations Committee, chaired by Balfour, drew up the document preparatory to its unanimous approval by the imperial premiers on 15 November 1926.<ref name="The Balfour Formula">{{cite journal |last=Marshall |first=Sir Peter |year=2001 |month=September |title=The Balfour Formula and the Evolution of the Commonwealth |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=90 |issue=361 |pages=pp. 541â€“53 |url= |accessdate=20 December 2008 |quote= |doi=10.1080/00358530120082823 }}</ref> It was first proposed by South African Prime Minister [[J.

The Declaration accepted the growing political and diplomatic independence of the Dominions, in the years after [[World War I]]. It also recommended that the [[Governor-General|governors-general]], the representatives of the King who acted for [[the Crown]] as ''de facto'' head of state in each dominion, should no longer also serve automatically as the representative of the British government in diplomatic relations between the countries. In following years, [[High Commissioner]]s were gradually appointed, whose duties were soon recognised to be virtually identical to those of an ambassador.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The first such British High Commissioner was appointed to [[Ottawa]] in 1928.

The conclusions of the imperial premiers conference of 1926 were restated by the 1930 conference and incorporated in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of December 1931, by which the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] renounced any legislative authority over dominion affairs, except as specifically provided in law.
