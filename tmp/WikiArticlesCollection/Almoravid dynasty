{{History of Morocco}}
{{History of Mauritania}}
The '''Almoravids''' ({{lang-ber|ⵉⵎⵕⴰⴱⴹⴻⵏ}} ''Imṛabḍen'', {{lang-ar|المرابطون}} ''Al-Murābiṭūn'') were a [[Berber people|Berber]] [[dynasty]] of [[Morocco]],<ref>G. Stewart, ''Is the Caliph a Pope?'', in: ''The Muslim World,'' Volume 21, Issue 2, pages 185–196, April 1931: "The Almoravid dynasty, among the Berbers of North Africa, founded a considerable empire,
Morocco being the result of their conquests"</ref><ref>SADIQI, FATIMA, ''The place of Berber in Morocco'', International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 123.1 (2009): 7-22 : "The Almoravids were the first relatively recent Berber dynasty that ruled Morocco. The leaders of this dynasty came from the Moroccan deep south."</ref> who formed an empire in the 11th century that stretched over the western [[Maghreb]] and [[Al-Andalus]]. Their capital was [[Marrakesh]], a city they founded in 1062. The dynasty originated among the [[Lamtuna]] and the Gudala, nomadic Berber tribes of the [[Sahara]], traversing the territory between the [[Draa River|Draa]], the [[Niger River|Niger]] and the [[Senegal river|Senegal]] rivers.<ref>Extract from [http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/A912241/ALMORAVIDES.htm ''Encyclopedia Universalis on Almoravids''].</ref>

The Almoravids were crucial in preventing a fall of [[Al-Andalus]] to the Iberian Christian kingdoms, when they decisively beat a coalition of the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] armies at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]]. This enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3,000 kilometers north to south. However, the rule of the dynasty was relatively short-lived. The Almoravids fell - at the height of their power - when they failed to quell the [[Masmuda]]-led rebellion initiated by [[Ibn Tumart]]. As a result, their last king [[Ishaq ibn Ali]] was killed in Marrakesh in April 1147 by the [[Almohad]]s, who replaced them as a ruling dynasty both in Morocco and [[Al-Andalus]].

==Name==
The term "Almoravid" comes from the Arabic "al-Murabitun" ({{lang|ar|المرابطون}}), which is the plural form of "al-Murabit" - literally meaning "one who is tying" but figuratively meaning "one who is ready for battle at a fortress". The term is related to the notion of [[Ribat]], a frontier monastery-fortress, through the root r-b-t ({{lang|ar|ربط}} "Rabat": ''to tie'' or {{lang|ar|رابط}} "Raabat": ''to encamp'').<ref>Nehemia Levtzion, "Abd Allah b. Yasin and the Almoravids", in: John Ralph Willis, ''Studies in West African Islamic History'',  p. 54.</ref><ref>P. F. de Moraes Farias, "The Almoravids: Some Questions Concerning the Character of the Movement", ''Bulletin de l’IFAN'', series B, 29: 3-4 (794-878), 1967.</ref>

It is uncertain exactly when or why the Almoravids acquired that appellation. [[al-Bakri]], writing in 1068, before their apex, already calls them the ''al-Murabitun'', but does not clarify the reasons for it. Writing three centuries later, [[Ibn Abi Zar]] suggested it was chosen early on by Abdallah Ibn Yasin<ref>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 81]].</ref> because, upon finding resistance among the Gudala Berbers of Adrar (Mauritania) to his teaching, he took a handful of followers to erect a makeshift ''ribat'' (monastery-fortress) on an offshore island (possibly [[Tidra]] island, in [[Bay of Arguin|Arguin bay]]).<ref>Ibn Abi Zar's account is translated in N. Levtzion and J. F. P. Hopkins, eds (2000), ''Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History'', University of Ghana,pp. 239ff. For tentative identification of the ''ribat'', see Moraes Farias (1967).</ref> [[Ibn Idhari]] wrote that the name was suggested by Ibn Yasin in the "persevering in the fight" sense, to boost morale after a particularly hard-fought battle in the [[Draa]] valley c. 1054, in which they had taken many losses. Whichever explanation is true, it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the Almoravids for themselves, partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications.

The name might be related to the ''ribat'' of [[Waggag ibn Zallu al-Lamti|Waggag ibn Zallu]] in the village of Aglu (near present-day [[Tiznit]]), where the future Almoravid spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin got his initial training. The 13th-century Moroccan biographer [[Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili]], and [[Qadi Ayyad]] before him in the 12th century, note that Waggag's learning center was called ''Dar al-Murabitin'' (The house of the Almoravids), and that might have inspired Ibn Yasin's choice of name for the movement.<ref>{{cite book

Contemporaries frequently referred to them as the ''al-mulathimun'' ("the veiled ones", from ''litham'', [[Arabic]] for "veil"). The Almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes (see [[tagelmust]]), a custom they adapted from southern [[Sanhaja]] Berbers. (This can still be seen among the modern [[Tuareg people]], but it was unusual further north). Although practical for the desert dust, the Almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere, as a badge of "foreignness" in urban settings, partly as a way of emphasizing their puritan credentials. It served as the uniform of the Almoravids.  Under their rule, [[sumptuary law]]s forbade anybody else from wearing the veil, thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class. In turn, the succeeding [[Almohads]] made a point of mocking the Almoravid veil as symbolic of [[effeminacy]] and decadence.

==Origins==

The [[Berber people]]s of the [[Maghreb]] in the early Middle Ages could be roughly classified into three major groups: the [[Zenata]] across the north, the [[Masmuda]] concentrated in central Morocco, and the [[Sanhaja]], clustered in two areas: the western part of the [[Sahara]] and the hills of the eastern Maghreb.<ref>{{cite book|author=ʻAbd al-Wāḥid Dhannūn Ṭāhā|title=The Muslim conquest and settlement of North Africa and Spain|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-415-00474-8}} ({{google books|TgcOAAAAQAAJ|online}})</ref><ref>Mones (1988), p. 119; (1992), p. 228.</ref> The eastern Sanhaja included the [[Kutama]] Berbers, who had been the base of the [[Fatimid]] rise in the early 10th century, and the [[Zirid dynasty]], who ruled [[Ifriqiya]] as vassals of the Fatimids after the latter moved to Egypt in 972. The western Sanhaja were divided into several tribes: the Gazzula and the [[Lamta]] in the [[Draa valley]] and the foothills of the [[Anti-Atlas]] range; further south, encamped in the western [[Sahara desert]], were the Massufa, the [[Lamtuna]] and the Banu Warith; and most southerly of all, the Gudala (or Judala), in littoral [[Mauritania]] down to the borderlands of the [[Senegal River]].

The western Sanhaja had been converted to [[Islam]] some time in the 9th century. They were subsequently united in the 10th century and, with the zeal of neophyte converts, launched several campaigns against the "[[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]ese" (pagan black peoples of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]).<ref>Lewicki (1988), pp. 160-61; (1992), pp. 308-09.</ref> Under their king Tinbarutan ibn Usfayshar, the Sanhaja Lamtuna erected (or captured) the citadel of [[Awdaghust]], a critical stop on the [[trans-Saharan trade]] route. After the collapse of the Sanhaja union, Awdagust passed over to the [[Ghana empire]]; and the trans-Saharan routes were taken over by the [[Zenata]] [[Maghrawa]] of [[Sijilmassa]]. The Maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the Sanhaja Gazzula and Lamta out of their pasturelands in the Sous and Draa valleys. Around 1035, the Lamtuna chieftain Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Tifat (alias Tarsina), tried to reunite the Sanhaja desert tribes, but his reign lasted less than three years.

Around 1040, [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], a chieftain of the Gudala (and brother-in-law of the late Tarsina), went on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. On his return, he stopped by [[Kairouan]] in [[Ifriqiya]], where he met [[Abu Imran al-Fasi]], a native of [[Fes]] and a jurist and scholar of the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. At this time, Ifriqiya was in ferment, the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] ruler [[al-Muizz ibn Badis]], was openly contemplating breaking with his [[Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid]] overlords in Cairo, and the jurists of Kairouan were agitating for him to do so. Absorbing this heady atmosphere, Yahya and Abu Imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands, and Yahya expressed his disappointment on the lack of religious education and negligence of [[Islamic law]] among his southern Sanhaja people. With Abu Imran's recommendation, Yahya ibn Ibrahim made his way to the ''ribat'' of Waggag ibn Zelu in the [[Sous]] valley of southern Morocco, to seek out a Maliki teacher for his people. Waggag assigned him one of his residents, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]].

Abdallah ibn Yasin was a Gazzula Berber, and probably a convert rather than a born Muslim. His name can be read as "son of [[Ya Sin]]" (the title of the 36th [[Sura]] of the [[Qur'an]]), suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was "re-born" of the Holy Book.<ref>M. Brett and E. Fentress (1996), ''The Berbers'', Oxford: Blackwell, p. 100. Revealingly, the 36th Sura begins the salutation "You are one of messengers" and the imperative duty to set people "on the straight path". Ibn Yasin's choice of name was probably not a coincidence.</ref> Ibn Yasin certainly had the ardor of a puritan zealot; his creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the [[Qur'an]], and the [[Sunnah|Orthodox tradition]].<ref name="shilling88" /> (Chroniclers such as al-Bakri allege Ibn Yasin's learning was superficial.) Ibn Yasin's initial meetings with the Gudala people went poorly. As he had more ardor than depth, Ibn Yasin's arguments were disputed by his audience. He responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations. The Gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, sometime in the 1040s.

Ibn Yasin, however, found a more favorable reception among the neighboring Lamtuna people.<ref name="shilling88">{{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=History of Africa|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-333-59957-0|page=88}}</ref> Probably sensing the useful organizing power of Ibn Yasin's pious fervor, the Lamtuna chieftain [[Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni]] invited the man to preach to his people. The Lamtuna leaders, however, kept Ibn Yasin on a careful leash, forging a more productive partnership between them. Invoking stories of the early life of the Prophet Muhammad, Ibn Yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to Islamicization, that it was not enough to merely adhere to God's law, but necessary to also destroy opposition to it. In Ibn Yasin's ideology, anything and everything outside of Islamic law could be characterized as "opposition". He identified tribalism, in particular, as an obstacle. He believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences, and embrace the equality of all Muslims under the Sacred Law, it was necessary to make them do so. For the Lamtuna leadership, this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to refound the Sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions. In the early 1050s, the Lamtuna, under the joint leadership of Yahya ibn Umar and Abdallah ibn Yasin - soon calling themselves the ''al-Murabitin'' (Almoravids) - set out on a campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause.

==Conquests==

===Northern Africa===
From the year 1053, the Almoravids began to spread their religious way to the Berber areas of the Sahara, and to the regions south of the desert. After winning over the [[Sanhaja]] Berber tribe, they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route, seizing [[Sijilmasa]] at the northern end in 1054, and [[Aoudaghost]] at the southern end in 1055. Yahya ibn Umar was killed in a battle in 1057,<ref name="shilling90">Shillington, p. 90.</ref> but Abdullah ibn Yasin, whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount, named his brother [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] as chief. Under him, the Almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert, and conquered the tribes of the [[Atlas Mountains]]. They then came in contact with the [[Berghouata]], a Berber tribal confederation, who followed a "heresy" founded by [[Salih ibn Tarif]], three centuries earlier. The Berghouata resisted, and it was in battle with them that Abdullah ibn Yasin was killed in 1059, in a village called "Krifla" located near [[Rommani]], Morocco. They were, however, completely conquered by [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], and adopted Islam as a religion. Abu Bakr married a noble and wealthy woman, [[Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat]], who  would become very influential in the development of the dynasty.<ref name=ZAR87>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 87]].</ref> Zaynab was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Houara (a [[Masmuda]] tribe), who is said to be from [[Kairouan]] in origin.<ref name=ZAR87/>

In 1061, [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] made a division of the power he had established, handing over the more-settled parts to his cousin [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] as [[viceroy]], and also assigning to him his favourite wife Zaynab.  Ibn Umar kept the task of suppressing the revolts that had broken out in the desert. When he returned to resume control, he found his cousin too powerful to be superseded. In November 1087,<ref name=ZAR89>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 89]].</ref> Abu Bakr was killed in battle by a poisoned arrow, while fighting in the historic region of the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]].<ref name=ZAR89/>

Yusuf ibn Tashfin had in the meantime brought the large area of what is now known as Morocco, [[Western Sahara]] and [[Mauretania]] into complete subjection. In 1062 he founded the city of [[Marrakech]]. In 1080, he conquered the kingdom of [[Tlemcen]] (in modern-day [[Algeria]]) and founded the present city of that name, his rule extending as far east as [[Oran]].<ref name=br1911/>

===Ghana Empire===
The Almoravids conquered the [[Ghana Empire]] sometime around 1075 CE.<ref>''Muslim Societies in African History'' (New approaches to African History) David Robinson</ref> According to Arab tradition, the ensuing war pushed Ghana over the edge, ending the kingdom's position as a commercial and military power by 1100. It collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies, some of which later assimilated into the Almoravids while others founded the [[Mali Empire]]. However, the Almoravid religious influence was gradual and not heavily involved in military strife; there the Almoravids increased in power by marrying among the nation's nobility. Scholars such as Dierk Lange attribute the decline of ancient Ghana to numerous unrelated factors, only one of which can be likely attributable to internal dynastic struggles that were instigated by Almalvorid influence and Islamic pressures, but devoid of any military conversion and conquest.<ref>Lange, Dierk (1996), "The Almoravid expansion and the downfall of Ghana", ''Der Islam'' 73, pp. 122-59.</ref>

===Southern Iberia===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
[[File:Almoravids Sevilla Spain 1116.jpg|thumb|upright|Almoravid [[gold dinar]] coin from [[Seville]], [[Spain]], 1116. ([[British Museum]]).  The Almoravid gold dinar would set the standard of the Iberian ''[[maravedi]]''.]]
In 1086 [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] was invited by the Muslim ''[[taifa]]'' princes of [[Al-Andalus]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] to defend their territories from the encroachment of [[Alfonso VI of León|Alfonso VI]], King of [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. In that year, [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to [[Algeciras]], and defeated Castile at the [[Battle of az-Zallaqah]] (Battle of Sagrajas). He was prevented from following up his victory by trouble in [[Africa]], which he chose to settle in person.

He returned to Iberia in 1090, avowedly for the purpose of annexing the ''taifa'' principalities of Iberia. He was supported by most of the Iberian people, who were discontented with the heavy taxation imposed upon them by their spendthrift rulers. Their religious teachers, as well as others in the east, (most notably, [[al-Ghazali]] in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[al-Tartushi]] in Egypt, who was himself an Iberian by birth from [[Tortosa]]), detested the ''taifa'' rulers for their religious indifference. The clerics issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' (a non-binding legal opinion) that Yusuf was of sound morals and had the religious right to dethrone the rulers, whom he saw as heterodox in their faith. By 1094, Yusuf had annexed most of the major ''taifas'', with the exception of the one at [[Saragossa]]. Yusuf did not reconquer much territory from the Christian kingdoms, except that of [[Valencia]], but he did hinder the progress of the Spanish [[Reconquista]] by uniting [[al-Andalus]].

After friendly correspondence with the caliph at [[Baghdad]], whom he acknowledged as ''Amir al-Mu'minin'' ("Commander of the Faithful"), Yusuf ibn Tashfin in 1097 assumed the title of ''Amir al Muslimin'' ("Commander of the Muslims"). He died in 1106, when he was reputed to have reached the age of 100. The Almoravid power was at its height at Yusuf's death: the Moorish empire then included all of North-West Africa as far as [[Algiers]], and all of Iberia south of the [[Tagus]] as far eastward as the mouth of the [[Ebro]], including the [[Balearic Islands]].

==Decline==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
Three years afterwards, under Yusuf's son and successor, [[Ali ibn Yusuf]], [[Sintra]] and [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] were added, and he invaded Iberia again in 1119 and 1121, but the tide had turned, as the French had assisted the Aragonese to recover [[Zaragoza]].  In 1138, Ali ibn Yusuf was defeated by [[Alfonso VII of León]], and in the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), by [[Afonso I of Portugal]], who thereby won his crown. [[Siege of Lisbon|Lisbon was conquered]] by the Portuguese in 1147.

According to some scholars, Ali ibn Yusuf was a new generation of leadership that had forgot the desert life for the comforts of the city.<ref>''North Africa, Islam and the Mediterranean World: From the Almoravids to the Algerian War'' (History & Society in the Islamic World), pg 59  By Julia Ann Clancy-Smith</ref> He was defeated by the combined action of his Christian foes in Iberia and the agitation of [[Almohads]] (the Muwahhids) in Morocco. After Ali ibn Yusuf's death in 1143, his son Tashfin ibn Ali lost ground rapidly before the Almohads. In 1146 he was killed in a fall from a precipice while attempting to escape after a defeat near [[Oran]].

His two successors were [[Ibrahim ibn Tashfin]] and [[Ishaq ibn Ali]], but their reigns were short. The conquest of the city of [[Marrakech]] by the Almohads in 1147 marked the fall of the dynasty, though fragments of the Almoravids (the [[Banu Ghaniya]]), continued to struggle in the Balearic Islands, and finally in [[Tunisia]].

==Military organization==
[[Abdallah ibn Yassin]] imposed very strict discipline measures on his forces for every breach of his laws.<ref name="AIY religion">[[#Bakri|al-Bakri, pp. 169-72]].</ref> The Almoravids' first military leader, Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni, gave them a good military organization.<ref name=br1911>''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (11th edition). Cambridge University Press.</ref> Their main force was infantry, armed with javelins in the front ranks and pikes behind, which formed into a phalanx;<ref name=br1911/><ref name="bakri mil">[[#Bakri|al-Bakri, p. 166]].</ref> and was supported by camelmen and horsemen on the flanks.<ref name=br1911/><ref name="bakri mil"/> They also had a flag carrier at the front who guided the forces behind him; when the flag was upright, the combatants behind would stand and when it was turned down, they would sit.<ref name="bakri mil"/>

[[al-Bakri]] reports that, while in combat, the Almoravids did not pursue those who fled in front of them.<ref name="bakri mil"/> Their fighting was intense and they did not retreat when disadvantaged by an advancing opposing force; they preferred death over defeat.<ref name="bakri mil"/> These characteristics were possibly unusual at the time.<ref name="bakri mil"/>
