She is best remembered as a leader in the fight for [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]], as a co-founder and co-editor with her brother [[Max Eastman]] of the radical arts and politics magazine ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]],'' co-founder of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], and co-founder in 1920 of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. In 2000 she was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in [[Seneca Falls, New York]].

==Early life and education==

Crystal Eastman was born in [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]] on June 25, 1881, the third of four children. In 1883 their parents, Samuel Elijah Eastman and Annis Bertha Ford, moved the family to [[Canandaigua, New York]], where her brother Max was born. The following year their older brother died at age seven. In 1889, their mother became one of the first women ordained as a [[Protestant]] minister in America when she became a minister of the [[Congregationalist Church]].<ref>Ida Harper Husted, “A Woman Minister Who Presides Over a Large Eastern Church.” ''The San Francisco Chronicle,'' 27 January 1901.</ref> Her father was also a Congregation minister, and the two served as pastors at the church of [[Thomas K. Beecher]] near [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]]. This part of [[New York State|New York]] was in the so-called "Burnt Over District." During the [[Second Great Awakening]] earlier in the 19th century, its frontier had been a center of evangelizing and much religious excitement, which resulted in the founding of the [[Shakers]] and [[Mormonism]]. During the [[antebellum]] period, some were inspired by religious ideals to support such progressive social causes as [[abolitionism]] and the [[Underground Railroad]].  

Crystal and her brother [[Max Eastman]] were influenced by this progressive tradition. Their  parents were friendly with the writer [[Mark Twain]]. From this association young Crystal also became acquainted with him. 

{{main|Max Eastman}}
She was the sister of the [[socialism|socialist]] activist [[Max Eastman]], with whom she was quite close throughout her life.<ref name=nwhm>

Humphrey, ''Children of Fantasy: The First Rebels of Greenwich Village'' (New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1978)</ref> The group, including Ida Rauh, [[Inez Milholland]], [[Floyd Dell]], and [[Doris Stevens]], also spent summers and weekends in [[Croton on the Hudson, New York|Croton on the Hudson]].<ref>Max Eastman, ''Love and Revolution: My Journey Through an Epoch,'' (New York: Random House, 1964): 79-81.</ref>

Eastman graduated from [[Vassar College]] in 1903 and received an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in [[sociology]] (a relatively new field) from [[Columbia University]] in 1904. Gaining her law degree from [[New York University Law School]], she graduated second in the class of 1907.<ref name=brittanica /><ref name=vassar>

==Social efforts==

Social work pioneer and journal editor [[Paul Kellogg]] offered Eastman her first job, investigating labor conditions for [[The Pittsburgh Survey]] sponsored by the [[Russell Sage Foundation]].<ref name=brittanica /><ref name=iup>

She continued to campaign for occupational safety and health while working as an investigating attorney for the U.S. Commission on Industrial Relations during [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s presidency. She was at one time called the "most dangerous woman in America," due to her [[free-love]] idealism and outspoken nature.

==Emancipation==

During a brief marriage to Wallace J. Benedict which ended in divorce, Eastman lived in [[Milwaukee]] and managed the unsuccessful 1912 [[Wisconsin]] [[suffrage]] battle.<ref name=nwhm />

When she returned east in 1913, she joined [[Alice Paul]], [[Lucy Burns]], and others in founding the militant [[Congressional Union]], which became the [[National Woman's Party]]. After the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] gave women the vote in 1920, Eastman and three others wrote the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], first introduced in 1923. One of the few socialists to endorse the ERA, she warned that protective legislation for women would mean only discrimination against women. Eastman claimed that one could assess the importance of the ERA by the intensity of the opposition to it, but she felt that it was still a struggle worth fighting.

==Peace efforts==

[[File:Eastman-Crystal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Crystal Eastman was a noted anti-militarist, who helped found the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.]]
During [[World War I]], Eastman was one of the founders of the [[Woman's Peace Party]], soon joined by [[Jane Addams]], [[Lillian D. Wald]], and others.<ref name=msmagazine>

| accessdate = 18 October 2011}}</ref>  She served as president of the [[New York City|New York]] branch. Renamed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] in 1921, it remains the oldest extant women's peace organization. Eastman also became executive director of the [[American Union Against Militarism]], which lobbied against America's entrance into the European war and more successfully against war with Mexico in 1916, sought to remove profiteering from arms manufacturing, and campaigned against [[conscription]] and imperial adventures. 

When the United States entered World War I, Eastman organized with [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]] and [[Norman Thomas]] the [[National Civil Liberties Bureau]] to protect [[conscientious objectors]], or in her words: "To maintain something over here that will be worth coming back to when the weary war is over." The NCLB grew into the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], with Baldwin at the head and Eastman functioning as attorney-in-charge. Eastman is credited as a founding member of the ACLU, but her role as founder of the NCLB may have been largely ignored by posterity due to her personal differences with Baldwin.<ref name=vassar />

==Marriage and family==
In 1916 Eastman married the British editor and antiwar activist [[Walter Fuller (British editor)]], who had come to the United States to escape the [[Great War]].<ref name=nwhm />  They had two children, [[Jeffrey Fuller|Jeffrey]] and Annis.  They worked together as activists until the end of the war, when he returned to [[England]] to find paying work.

In 1917, Eastman co-founded a radical journal of politics, art, and literature, ''[[The Liberator (United States magazine)|The Liberator]]'', with her brother [[Max Eastman|Max]].<ref name=nwhm />  She served as managing editor from 1917 to 1921.<ref name=cuny>

===Post-War===
After the war, Eastman organized the [[First Feminist Congress]] in 1919.

She traveled by ship to [[London]] to be with her husband at times. In New York, her activities led to her being blacklisted during the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] of 1919-1920. She struggled to find paying work.

During the 1920s her only paid work was as a columnist for feminist journals, notably ''[[Equal Rights (journal)|Equal Rights]]'' and ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]''.  Eastman claimed that "life was a big battle for the complete feminist," but she was convinced that the complete feminist would someday achieve total victory.

Her husband died in 1927.

===Death===
Crystal Eastman died on July 8, 1928, of [[nephritis]].<ref name=vassar /> Her friends ''blank-blank'' were entrusted with her two children, then orphans, to rear them until adulthood.

==Legacy==
Eastman has been called one of the United States' most neglected leaders, because, although she wrote pioneering legislation and created long-lasting political organizations, she disappeared from history for fifty years. [[Freda Kirchwey]], then editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', wrote at the time of her death: "When she spoke to people—whether it was to a small committee or a swarming crowd—hearts beat faster. She was for thousands a symbol of what the free woman might be."<ref name=vassar />
In 2000 Eastman was inducted in the (American) [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in [[Seneca Falls (town), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]].
