Transport infrastructure within [[Chad]] is generally poor, especially in the north and east of the country.  River transport is limited to the south-west corner. As of 2011 Chad had no railways though two lines are planned - from the capital to the Sudanese and Cameroonish borders.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Roads are mostly unsurfaced and are likely to be impassable during the [[wet season]], especially in the southern half of the country.  In the north, roads are merely tracks across the [[desert]] and [[land mines]] continue to present a danger.  Draft animals ([[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and [[camel]]s) remain important in much of the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Fuel supplies can be erratic, even in the south-west of the country, and are expensive.  Elsewhere they are practically non-existent.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Railways ==
{{main|Rail transport in Chad}}
As of 2011 Chad had no railways. Two lines are planned to Sudan and Cameroon from the capital, with construction expected to start in 2012.<ref>

== Highways ==
Chad has a total of 33,400&nbsp;km of roads of which approximately 500&nbsp;km are paved.  Some, but not all of the roads in the capital N'Djamena are paved. Outside of N'Djamena there is one paved road which runs from Massakory in the north, through N'Djamena and then south, through the cities of Guelendeng, Bongor, Kelo and Moundou, with a short spur leading in the direction of Kousseri, Cameroon, near N'Djamena.  Expansion of the road towards Cameroon via Pala and Lere is reportedly in the preparatory stages.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Waterways ==
Most rivers flow but intermittently. On the [[Chari River|Chari]], between N’Djamena and [[Lake Chad]], transportation is possible all year round. In September and October, the [[Logone River|Logone]] is navigable between N’Djamena and [[Moundou]], and the [[Chari River|Chari]] between N’Djamena and Sarh. Total waterways cover 4,800&nbsp;km (3,000&nbsp;mi), of which 2,000&nbsp;km (1,250&nbsp;mi) are navigable all year.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Chari and Logone Rivers are navigable only in wet season (2002).  Both flow northwards, from the south of Chad, into [[Lake Chad]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Pipelines==
Since 2003, a 1,070&nbsp;km pipeline has been used to export [[crude oil]] from the [[oilfield]]s around [[Doba]] to offshore oil-loading facilities on [[Cameroon]]'s [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] coast at [[Kribi]].<ref>

== Seaports and harbors ==
None ([[landlocked]]).

Chad's main routes to the sea are:{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* From [[N'Djamena]] and the south west of Chad:
** By road to [[Ngaoundéré]], in Cameroon, and then by rail to [[Douala]]
** By road to [[Maiduguri]], in [[Nigeria]], and then by rail to [[Port Harcourt]]
* From the north and east of Chad:
** By road across the [[Sahara]] desert to [[Libya]]

In colonial times, the main access was by road to [[Bangui]], in the [[Central African Republic]], then by river boat to [[Brazzaville]], and onwards by rail from Brazzaville to [[Pointe Noire]], on [[Republic of Congo|Congo's]] [[Atlantic]] coast. This route is now little used.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

There is also a route across [[Sudan]], to the [[Red Sea]], but very little trade goes this way.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Links with [[Niger]], north of Lake Chad, are practically nonexistent; it is easier to reach Niger via Cameroon and Nigeria.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Airports ==
{{As of|2012}} Chad had an estimated 58 airports, only 9 of which had paved runways.<ref name="CIA-WFB">

</ref> [[Air Tchad]] (60 percent state owned) provides internal service to 12 locations but suffers from lack of fuel and equipment. The international airport at N’Djamena was damaged in fighting in 1981, but is now served by several international carriers including [[Air Afrique]], which is partly owned by Chad. Another major airport, developed as a military staging area, is located at [[Sarh]]. In 2003, scheduled airlines in Chad carried about 46,000 passengers on domestic and international flights.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
