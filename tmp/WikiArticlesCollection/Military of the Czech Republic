The '''Army of the Czech Republic''' ({{lang-cs|Armáda České Republiky}}) comprise the land forces, the [[Czech Air Force]] and support units. From the late 1940s to 1989, the extensive [[Czechoslovak Armed Forces]] (about 200,000) formed one of the pillars of the [[Warsaw Pact]] military alliance. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the [[Czech Republic]] is completing a major reorganisation and reduction of the armed forces, which intensified after the Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999.<ref name="Europe">[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/04597222.2011.559835"Military Balance in Europe 2011".], March 07, 2011.</ref>

==History==
The Czechoslovak Armed Forces were originally formed after 1918, when [[Czechoslovakia]] was created from former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] areas after the defeat of that country in [[World War I]]. Following the downfall of Czechoslovakia and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupation of its Czech part]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, Czechoslovak units and formations served with the [[Polish Army]] ([[Czechoslovak Legion (1939)|Czechoslovak Legion]]), the [[French Army]], the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[British Army]] (the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]]), and the [[Red Army]] ([[I Corps (Czechoslovakia)|I Corps]]). Four Czech and Slovak-manned RAF squadrons were transferred to Czechoslovak control in late 1945.

From 1954{{Citation needed|reason=Czechoslovak People's Army article sets the date as 1954.|date=July 2012}} until 1990, the Army was known as the [[Czechoslovak People's Army]] (ČSLA).<ref>For more information on the Czechoslovak Army during the Cold War, see Gordon L. Rottman, ''Warsaw Pact Ground Forces'', [[Osprey Publishing]], 1987</ref> Although the ČSLA, as formed in 1945, included both Soviet- and British-equipped/trained expatriate troops, the "Western" soldiers had been purged from the ČSLA after 1948 when the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|communists took power]]. The ČSLA offered no resistance to the invasion mounted by the Soviets in 1968 in reaction to the "[[Prague Spring]]", and was extensively reorganized by the Soviets following the re-imposition of communist rule in Prague.

"Of the approximately 201,000 personnel on active duty in the ČSLA in 1987, about 145,000, or about 72 percent, served in the ground forces (commonly referred to as the army). About 100,000 of these were conscripts."<ref>Library of Congress Country Study: Czechoslovakia, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cs0133) Ground Forces], 1987</ref> There were two military districts, Western and Eastern. A 1989 listing of forces shows two Czechoslovak armies in the west, the 1st at [[Příbram]] with one tank division and three motor rifle divisions, the 4th at [[Písek]] with two tank divisions and two motor rifle divisions. In the Eastern Military District, there were two tank divisions, the 13th and 14th, with a supervisory headquarters at [[Trenčín]] in the Slovak part of the country.<ref>Orbat.com, [http://www.orbat.com/site/history/historical/nato/warsawpact.html Warsaw Pact Order of Battle 1989], accessed 2 June 2010</ref>

During the [[Cold War]], the ČSLA was equipped primarily with Soviet arms, although certain arms like the [[OT-64 SKOT]] armored personnel carrier, the [[L-29|L-29 ''Delfín'']] and [[L-39|L-39 ''Albatros'']] aircraft, the [[P-27 (weapon)|P-27 ''Pancéřovka'']] antitank rocket launcher, the [[vz. 58|Sa vz. 58]] assault rifle or the [[Uk vz. 59]] machine gun were of Czechoslovak design.

===After 1992 (dissolution of Czechoslovakia)===

[[File:Czech army Sgt. Van Kmecik and Croatian army Master Sgt. Bravko Horvat discuss patrol routes.jpg|thumbnail|left|Czech Army Sgt. (left) discusses patrol routes with a Croatian Army Sgt. (right) while in Germany to prepare for deployment to Afghanistan.]]
The Army of the Czech Republic was formed after the Czechoslovak Armed Forces split after the 1 January 1993 dissolution of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Czech forces stood at 90,000 in 1993. They were reduced to around 65,000 in 11 combat brigades and the Air Force in 1997, to 63,601 in 1999,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceandstrategy.eu/filemanager/files/file.php?file=6406|title=Starting points for professionalization of the armed forces|language=Czech|year=2000|accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> and to 35,000 in 2005. At the same time, the forces were modernized and reoriented towards a defensive posture. In 2004, the army transformed itself into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished. The Army maintains an active reserve.

The [[Czech Republic]] is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. Since 1990, the ACR and the Czech Armed Forces have contributed to numerous peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, including [[IFOR]], [[SFOR]], and [[EUFOR Althea]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]]/[[Desert Storm]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]], [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]] and with the Coalition forces in [[Iraq]].

Current deployments (as of 2010):

*[[Kosovo]]: NATO Operation "Joint Enterprise" ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) - 450 soldiers
*[[Afghanistan]]: NATO Operation ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]) - 458 soldiers, 12 civilian experts and 3 [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-171S]] helicopters in Faizabad, Logar and Paktika provinces.
*[[Somalia]]: EU Operation Atalanta ([[European Union Naval Force Somalia – Operation ATALANTA|NAVFOR]]) - 3 soldiers
*[[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]]: UN peacekeeping mission ([[United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo|MONUC]]) - 3 military observers
*[[Afghanistan]]: UN peacekeeping mission ([[United Nations Assistance Mission of Afghanistan|UNAMA]]) - 1 military observer
*[[Kosovo]]: UN peacekeeping mission ([[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]) - 1 military observer

In February 2010, Czech media started to speculate about possible corruption around the purchase of [[Pandur II]] vehicles for the Czech Army.<ref>http://zpravy.idnes.cz/secret-pandur-agreement-bring-the-politicians-we-ll-pay-pio-/prilohy.asp?c=A100221_142541_domaci_abr</ref>

The 153rd Engineer Battalion based in Olomouc was created on 15 October 2008 and is subordinated to the 15th Engineer Brigade, Joint Forces Command. The unit is stationed in the outskirts of the city of Olomouc, in place of the canceled 156th Rescue Battalion.<ref>www.153zpr.army.cz - webové stránky praporu www.153zpr.army.cz</ref>

===Active reserves===
'''Active Reserve''' (in [[Czech language|Czech]] ''Aktivní záloha'') is a part of the otherwise professional Army of the Czech Republic. This service was created to allow the participation of citizens with a positive attitude to the military.

A volunteer needs either to have completed the compulsory military service (which ended in 2004) or to attend 8 week training. Then the reservists have to serve up to three weeks a year and can be called up to serve two weeks during a non-military crisis. They are not intended to serve abroad. The Reserve presents itself on events like [[BAHNA]], a military show.
