The '''Aimaq''' ({{lang-fa|ایماق}}), also transliterated as ''Aimak'' or ''Aymaq'', are a collection of [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking [[nomad]]ic and semi-nomadic tribes.<ref>Tom Lansford -''A bitter harvest: US foreign policy and Afghanistan'' 2003 Page 25 "The term Aimaq means "tribe" but the Aimaq people actually include several different ethnic groups. The classification has come to be used for a variety of nonaligned nomadic tribes"</ref> Aimaqs are found throughout the West Central [[Highland (geography)|highland]]s of [[Afghanistan]], immediately to the north of [[Herat]], and in the [[Khorasan Province]] of [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Janata|first=A. |editor= [[Ehsan Yarshater]]|encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|title= AYMĀQ|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/aymaq-turk |edition= Online Edition|publisher= [[Columbia University]]|location= United States}}</ref> They speak a number of subdialects of the [[Aimaq dialect]] of [[Persian language|Persian]], however some southern groups of [[Taymani]] and Maleki Aymaqs have adopted [[Pashto language|Pashto]].<ref name="Vogelsang">{{Cite book|title=The Afghans|last1=Vogelsang|first1=Willem|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=0631198415|page=18|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=taymani&source=bl&ots=54cpjBlxk3&sig=AfUVu5densvcdWoRFnpJ-e3kgtk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rEQdT9i8JfDN4QTB5cHyDQ&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=taymani&f=false |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>

Aimaks were originally known as ''chahar'' ("four") Aymaqs:  the [[Taimani]] (the main element in the population of [[Ghor]]), the [[Ferozkohi]], the [[Temuri]], and the [[Jamshidi (tribe)|Jamshidi]].  Other sources state that the [[Aimaq Hazara]] are one of the ''Chahar'', with the Temuri instead being of the "lesser Aimaqs" or ''Aimaq-e digar''<ref name="Vogelsang2002">{{cite book|author=Willem Vogelsang|title=The Afghans|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&pg=PA37|accessdate=1 April 2011|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780631198413|pages=37–}}</ref> ("other Aimaqs") along with the Tahiri, Zuri, Maleki, and Mishmast.

==Origin and classification==
Aimaks are closely related to [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]]s in varying degrees. In the Afghan [[census]], Aimaks are classified as Tajiks.<ref>[http://www.nps.edu/Programs/CCs/Ghor/Ghor.html Aimak, Ghor province on NPS]</ref> Aimaks live in parts of western and central Afghanistan, making up the majority in [[Ghor Province|Ghor]], and also live in large numbers in the western areas of [[Herat Province|Herat]] and [[Badghis Province|Badghis]], and to a lesser extent in [[Farah Province|Farah]], [[Faryab Province|Faryab]], [[Jowzjan Province|Jowzjan]], and [[Sar-e Pol Province|Sar-e Pol]]. The word "Aymāq" is Mongolian meaning "tribe" or "grazing territory". Attempts to link it somehow with Ancient Iranian semi-god patriarch Yima or Jamshid lack both linguistic and historical foundations.Aimaq Hazara and [[Taimuri]] are most [[mongoloid]] of the Aimaq. Temuri and Aimaq Hazara live in [[yurt]]s, whereas other Aimaqs live in traditional Afghan black tents.<ref>http://www.tribalanalysiscenter.com/PDF-External/Hazara%20Baluchistan.pdf A SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE HAZARA TRIBE IN BALUCHISTAN (AN ANALYSIS OF SOCIO-CULTURAL CHANGE)</ref>

==Demographics==
Estimates of the Aimaq population vary between 250,000 and 2 million. They are largely [[Sunni]] Muslims, in contrast to the Hazara, who are mostly [[Shia]]s. The Temuri Aimaqs are of Mongolian origin, apparent in their physical appearance and their housing (Mongolian-style [[yurt]]s).<ref>"Afghanistan". Encyclopædia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.</ref> However, the Taimanis, Ferozkohis, and Jamshidis are of Iranian origin, and refer to themselves as Tajik; the majority of the Aimaqs in Afghanistan are of these latter three sub-groups.
