The '''cell''' is the basic structural, functional and biological unit of all known [[Life|living]] [[organism]]s. Cells are the smallest unit of life that can [[Cell division|replicate]] independently, and are often called the "building blocks of life". 

Cells consist of a [[protoplasm]] enclosed within a [[Cell membrane|membrane]], which contains many biomolecules such as [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acids]].<ref name="Alberts2002">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&db=books&doptcmdl=GenBookHL&term=Cell+Movements+and+the+Shaping+of+the+Vertebrate+Body+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+374635%5Buid%5D&rid=mboc4.section.3919 Cell Movements and the Shaping of the Vertebrate Body] in Chapter 21 of ''[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&db=books&doptcmdl=GenBookHL&term=cell+biology+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+373693%5Buid%5D&rid=mboc4 Molecular Biology of the Cell]'' fourth edition, edited by Bruce Alberts (2002) published by Garland Science.<br /> The Alberts text discusses how the "cellular building blocks" move to shape developing [[embryo]]s.

The cell was discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665. The [[cell theory]], first developed in 1839 by [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]], states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that all cells come from preexisting cells, that vital [[Biological process|function]]s of an organism occur within cells, and that all cells contain the [[genetics|hereditary information]] necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells.<ref>{{cite book

==Anatomy==
There are two types of cells, [[eukaryote]]s, which contain a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and [[prokaryote]]s, which do not. Prokaryotic cells are usually [[Unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]], while eukaryotic cells can be either single-celled or part of [[multicellular organism]]s.

===Prokaryotic cells===
{{Main|Prokaryote}}
[[Image:Average prokaryote cell- en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of a typical [[prokaryotic]] cell]]
[[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells were the first form of life on Earth. They are simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells, and lack membrane-bound organelles such as the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Prokaryotes include two of the [[Domain (biology)|domains of life]], [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. The DNA of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single chromosome that is in direct contact with the [[cytoplasm]]. The nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the [[nucleoid]].

A prokaryotic cell has three architectural regions:
* On the outside, [[flagella]] and [[Pilus|pili]] project from the cell's surface. These are structures (not present in all prokaryotes) made of proteins that facilitate movement and communication between cells.
* Enclosing the cell is the [[cell envelope]] – generally consisting of a [[cell wall]] covering a [[plasma membrane]] though some bacteria also have a further covering layer called a [[bacterial capsule|capsule]]. The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates the interior of the cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter. Though most prokaryotes have a cell wall, there are exceptions such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' (bacteria) and ''[[Thermoplasma]]'' (archaea). The cell wall consists of [[peptidoglycan]] in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from expanding and bursting ([[cytolysis]]) from [[osmotic pressure]] due to a [[Tonicity#Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] environment. Some eukaryotic cells ([[plant cell]]s and [[fungus|fungal]] cells) also have a cell wall.
* Inside the cell is the [[cytoplasm|cytoplasmic region]] that contains the [[genome]] (DNA), ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. The [[Chromosome#Chromosomes in prokaryotes|prokaryotic chromosome]] is usually a circular molecule (an exception is that of the bacterium ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', which causes Lyme disease).<ref>European Bioinformatics Institute, [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/2can/genomes/bacteria/Borrelia_burgdorferi.html Karyn's Genomes: Borrelia burgdorferi], part of 2can on the EBI-EMBL database. Retrieved 5 August 2012</ref> Though not forming a ''nucleus'', the [[DNA]] is condensed in a ''nucleoid''. Prokaryotes can carry [[extrachromosomal DNA]] elements called [[plasmid]]s, which are usually circular. Plasmids encode additional genes, such as [[antibiotic resistance]] genes.

===Eukaryotic cells===
{{Main|Eukaryote}}

Plants, animals, fungi, slime moulds, protozoa, and algae are all [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]]. These cells are about fifteen times wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as a thousand times greater in volume. The main distinguishing feature of eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes is [[Cellular compartment|compartmentalization:]] the presence of membrane-bound compartments in which specific metabolic activities take place. Most important among these is a  [[cell nucleus]], a membrane-delineated compartment that houses the eukaryotic cell's DNA. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means "true nucleus." Other differences include:
* The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present.
* The eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called [[chromosome]]s, which are associated with [[histone]] proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the ''[[cell nucleus]]'', separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane. Some eukaryotic [[organelle]]s such as [[mitochondria]] also contain some DNA.
* Many eukaryotic cells are [[cilium|ciliated]] with ''primary cilia''. Primary cilia play important roles in chemosensation, [[mechanosensation]], and thermosensation. Cilia may thus be "viewed as a sensory cellular [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] that coordinates a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation."<ref name="Christenson2008">{{cite journal

==Subcellular components==
[[File:Blausen 0208 CellAnatomy.png|thumb|Illustration depicting major structures inside an eukaryotic animal cell]]
All cells, whether [[prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryotic]], have a [[cell membrane|membrane]] that envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out (selectively permeable), and maintains the [[Membrane potential|electric potential of the cell]]. Inside the membrane, a [[salt]]y [[cytoplasm]] takes up most of the cell volume. All cells (except [[red blood cell]]s which lack a cell nucleus and most organelles to accommodate maximum space for [[hemoglobin]]) possess [[DNA]], the hereditary material of [[gene]]s, and [[RNA]], containing the information necessary to [[gene expression|build]] various [[protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of [[biomolecule]]s in cells. This article lists these primary components of the cell, then briefly describes their function.

===Membrane===
{{Main|Cell membrane}}
The cell membrane, or plasma membrane, surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell. In animals, the plasma membrane is the outer boundary of the cell, while in plants and prokaryotes it is usually covered by a [[cell wall]]. This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a [[lipid bilayer|double layer of phospholipids]], which are [[amphiphilic]] (partly [[hydrophobic]] and partly [[hydrophilic]]). Hence, the layer is called a [[phospholipid bilayer]], or sometimes a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of [[protein]] molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell. The membrane is said to be 'semi-permeable', in that it can either let a substance ([[molecule]] or [[ion]]) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain [[Receptor (biochemistry)#Transmembrane receptors|receptor]] proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as [[hormone]]s.

===Cytoskeleton===
{{Main|Cytoskeleton}}
[[File:DAPIMitoTrackerRedAlexaFluor488BPAE.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A fluorescent image of an endothelial cell. Nuclei are stained blue, [[mitochondria]] are stained red, and microfilaments are stained green.]]
The cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during [[endocytosis]], the uptake of external materials by a cell, and [[cytokinesis]], the separation of daughter cells after [[cell division]]; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of [[microfilament]]s, [[intermediate filament]]s and [[microtubule]]s. There are a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments. The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and cytokinesis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michie K, Löwe J |title=Dynamic filaments of the bacterial cytoskeleton |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=75 |issue= |pages=467–92 |year=2006 |pmid=16756499 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142452}}</ref>

===Genetic material===
Two different kinds of genetic material exist: [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). Most cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA sequence. RNA is used for information transport (e.g., [[mRNA]]) and [[enzyme|enzymatic]] functions (e.g., [[ribosome|ribosomal]] RNA). [[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein [[translation]].

Prokaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple circular DNA molecule (the bacterial [[chromosome]]) in the [[nucleoid region]] of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different, linear molecules called [[chromosome]]s inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] (see [[endosymbiotic theory]]).

A human cell has genetic material contained in the [[cell nucleus]] (the [[genome|nuclear genome]]) and in the mitochondria (the [[mitochondrial genome]]). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called [[chromosome]]s, including 22 [[Homologous chromosome|homologous]] chromosome pairs and a pair of [[sex chromosomes]]. The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the [[mitochondrial DNA]] is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes, it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs.

Foreign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called [[transfection]]. This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's [[genome]], or stable, if it is. Certain [[virus]]es also insert their genetic material into the genome.

===Organelles===
{{Main|Organelle}}
Organelles are parts of the cell which are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions, analogous to the [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] of the human body (such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function). Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have organelles, but prokaryotic organelles are generally simpler and are not membrane-bound. 

There are several types of organelles in a cell. Some (such as the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[golgi apparatus]]) are typically solitary, while others (such as [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[peroxisomes]] and [[lysosomes]]) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands). The [[cytosol]] is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles.

====Eukaryotic====
[[Image:HeLa Hoechst 33258.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Human cancer cells with nuclei (specifically the DNA) stained blue. The central and rightmost cell are in [[interphase]], so the entire nuclei are labeled. The cell on the left is going through [[mitosis]] and its DNA has condensed.]]
* '''Cell nucleus''': A cell's information center, the [[cell nucleus]] is the most conspicuous organelle found in a [[eukaryotic]] cell. It houses the cell's [[chromosomes]], and is the place where almost all [[DNA]] replication and [[RNA]] synthesis ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]) occur. The nucleus is spherical and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the [[nuclear envelope]]. The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, [[DNA]] is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]], or copied into a special [[RNA]], called [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific protein molecule. The [[nucleolus]] is a specialized region within the nucleus where ribosome subunits are assembled. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the [[cytoplasm]].
* '''Mitochondria and Chloroplasts''': the power generators: [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are self-replicating organelles that occur in various numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria play a critical role in generating energy in the eukaryotic cell. [[Cellular respiration|Respiration]] occurs in the cell mitochondria, which generate the cell's energy by [[oxidative phosphorylation]], using [[oxygen]] to release energy stored in cellular nutrients (typically pertaining to [[glucose]]) to generate [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Mitochondria multiply by [[binary fission]], like prokaryotes. Chloroplasts can only be found in plants and algae, and they capture the sun's energy to make ATP.

[[Image:Endomembrane system diagram no text nucleus.png|thumb|Diagram of an endomembrane system]]
* '''Endoplasmic reticulum''': The [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) is a transport network for molecules targeted for certain modifications and specific destinations, as compared to molecules that float freely in the cytoplasm. The ER has two forms: the rough ER, which has ribosomes on its surface that secrete proteins into the ER, and the smooth ER, which lacks ribosomes. The smooth ER plays a role in calcium sequestration and release. (See [[Endoplasmic reticulum]])
* '''Golgi apparatus''': The primary function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package the [[macromolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s that are synthesized by the cell. (See [[Golgi apparatus]])
* '''Lysosomes and Peroxisomes''': [[Lysosome]]s contain [[digestive enzyme]]s (acid [[hydrolase]]s). They digest excess or worn-out [[organelle]]s, food particles, and engulfed [[virus]]es or [[bacteria]]. [[Peroxisome]]s have enzymes that rid the cell of toxic [[peroxide]]s. The cell could not house these destructive enzymes if they were not contained in a membrane-bound system. (See [[Lysosome]] and [[Peroxisome]])
* '''Centrosome''' – the cytoskeleton organiser: The [[centrosome]] produces the [[microtubules]] of a cell – a key component of the [[cytoskeleton]]. It directs the transport through the [[endoplasmic reticulum|ER]] and the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Centrosomes are composed of two [[centrioles]], which separate during [[cell division]] and help in the formation of the [[mitotic spindle]]. A single centrosome is present in the [[animal cell]]s. They are also found in some fungi and algae cells. (See [[Centrosome]])
* '''Vacuoles''': [[Vacuole]]s store food and waste. Some vacuoles store extra water. They are often described as liquid filled space and are surrounded by a membrane. Some cells, most notably ''[[Amoeba]]'', have contractile vacuoles, which can pump water out of the cell if there is too much water. The vacuoles of eukaryotic cells are usually larger in those of plants than animals. (See [[Vacuole]])

====Eukaryotic and prokaryotic====
* '''Ribosomes''': The [[ribosome]] is a large complex of [[RNA]] and [[protein]] molecules. They each consist of two subunits, and act as an assembly line where RNA from the nucleus is used to synthesise proteins from amino acids. Ribosomes can be found either floating freely or bound to a membrane (the rough endoplasmatic reticulum in eukaryotes, or the cell membrane in prokaryotes).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ménétret JF, Schaletzky J, Clemons WM, ''et al.'' |title=Ribosome binding of a single copy of the SecY complex: implications for protein translocation |journal=Mol. Cell |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1083–92 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18158904 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2007.10.034 |last2=Akey |first1=CW}}</ref>

==Structures outside the cell membrane==
Many cells also have structures which exist wholly or partially outside the cell membrane. These structures are notable because they are not protected from the external environment by the impermeable cell membrane. In order to assemble these structures, their components must be carried across the cell membrane by export processes.

===Cell wall===
Many types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have a [[cell wall]]. The cell wall acts to protect the cell mechanically and chemically from its environment, and is an additional layer of protection to the cell membrane. Different types of cell have cell walls made up of different materials; plant cell walls are primarily made up of pectin, fungi cell walls are made up of chitin and bacteria cell walls are made up of peptidoglycan.

===Prokaryotic===

====Capsule====
A gelatinous capsule is present in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall. The capsule may be [[polysaccharide]] as in [[pneumococci]], [[meningococci]] or [[polypeptide]] as ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' or [[hyaluronic acid]] as in [[streptococci]]. (See [[Bacterial capsule]].)
Capsules are not marked by normal staining protocols and can be detected by [[India ink#Uses other than writing|India ink]] or [[Methyl blue]]; which allows for higher contrast between the cells for observation.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=N2GU-DYKkk0C&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=Prokaryotic+india+ink#v=onepage&q=india%20ink&f=false | title=Prokaryotes | publisher=Newnes | year=Apr 11, 1996 | isbn=9780080984735}}</ref>{{rp|87}}

====Flagella====
[[Flagella]] are organelles for cellular mobility. The bacterial flagellum stretches from cytoplasm through the cell membrane(s) and extrudes through the cell wall. They are long and thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. Are most commonly found in bacteria cells but are found in animal cells as well.

====Fimbriae (pili)====
They are short and thin hair-like filaments, formed of protein called pilin (antigenic). [[Fimbria (bacteriology)|Fimbria]]e are responsible for attachment of bacteria to specific receptors of human cell (adherence). There are special types of pili called (sex pili) involved in conjunction. (See [[Pilus]].)

==Growth and metabolism==
{{Main|Cell growth|Metabolism}}
Between successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism. Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: [[catabolism]], in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and [[Reducing agent|reducing power]], and [[anabolism]], in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions.
Complex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into a less chemically complex sugar molecule called  [[glucose]]. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), a form of energy, through two different pathways.

The first pathway, [[glycolysis]], requires no oxygen and is referred to as [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]]. Each reaction produces [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]], which are used in cellular functions, as well as two [[pyruvate]] molecules that derive from the original glucose molecule. In prokaryotes, all energy is produced by glycolysis.

The second pathway, called the Krebs cycle or [[citric acid cycle]], is performed only by eukaryotes and involves further breakdown of the pyruvate produced in glycolysis. It occurs inside the mitochondria and generates much more energy than glycolysis, mostly through [[oxidative phosphorylation]].

==Replication==
[[Image:Three cell growth types.png|thumb|left|250px|Bacteria divide by [[binary fission]], while eukaryotes divide by [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]].]]
{{Main|Cell division}}
Cell division involves a single cell (called a ''mother cell'') dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in [[multicellular organism]]s (the growth of [[biological tissue|tissue]]) and to procreation ([[vegetative reproduction]]) in [[unicellular organism]]s. [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells divide by [[binary fission]], while [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called [[mitosis]], followed by division of the cell, called [[cytokinesis]]. A [[diploid]] cell may also undergo [[meiosis]] to produce haploid cells, usually four. [[Haploid]] cells serve as [[gamete]]s in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.

[[DNA replication]], or the process of duplicating a cell's genome, always happens when a cell divides through mitosis or binary fission. This occurs during the S phase of the [[cell cycle]].

In meiosis, the DNA is replicated only once, while the cell divides twice. DNA replication only occurs before [[meiosis I]]. DNA replication does not occur when the cells divide the second time, in [[meiosis II]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Campbell Biology—Concepts and Connections|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education|pages=138}}</ref> Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job.

==Protein synthesis==
[[Image:Proteinsynthesis.png|frame|100px|right|An overview of protein synthesis.<br/>Within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the cell (''light blue''), [[gene]]s (DNA, ''dark blue'') are [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into [[RNA]]. This RNA is then subject to post-transcriptional modification and control, resulting in a mature [[mRNA]] (''red'') that is then transported out of the nucleus and into the [[cytoplasm]] (''peach''), where it undergoes [[translation (genetics)|translation]] into a protein. mRNA is translated by [[ribosome]]s (''purple'') that match the three-base [[codon]]s of the mRNA to the three-base anti-codons of the appropriate [[transfer RNA|tRNA]]. Newly synthesized proteins (''black'') are often further modified, such as by binding to an effector molecule (''orange''), to become fully active.]]

{{Main|Protein biosynthesis}}
Cells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

Transcription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called [[ribosome]]s located in the [[cytosol]], where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.

==Movement or motility==
Cells can move during many processes: such as wound healing, the immune response and [[cancer metastasis]]. For wound healing to occur, white blood cells and cells that ingest bacteria move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection.<br />
At the same time fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) move there to remodel damaged structures. In the case of tumor development, cells from a primary tumor move away and spread to other parts of the body. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins.<ref>{{cite web|author=Revathi Ananthakrishnan1 *, Allen Ehrlicher2 &#x2709; |url=http://www.biolsci.org/v03p0303.htm |title=The Forces Behind Cell Movement |publisher=Biolsci.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref> The process is divided into three steps – protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward.

==Origins==<!-- This section is linked from [[Timeline of evolution]] -->
{{Main|Evolutionary history of life}}
The origin of cells has to do with the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]], which began the [[timeline of evolution|history of life]] on Earth.

===Origin of the first cell===
[[File:Stromatolites.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Stromatolites]] are left behind by [[cyanobacteria]], also called blue-green algae. They are the oldest known fossils of life on Earth. This one-billion-year-old fossil is from [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in the [[United States]].]]
{{further2|[[Abiogenesis]]|[[Evolution of cells]]}}

There are several theories about the origin of small molecules that led to life on the [[early Earth]]. They may have been carried to Earth on meteorites (see [[Murchison meteorite]]), created at [[Hydrothermal vent|deep-sea vents]], or synthesized by lightning in a reducing atmosphere (see [[Miller–Urey experiment]]). There is little experimental data defining what the first self-replicating forms were. [[RNA]] is thought to be the earliest self-replicating molecule, as it is capable of both storing genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions (see [[RNA world hypothesis]]), but some other entity with the potential to self-replicate could have preceded RNA, such as [[Abiogenesis#Clay_theory|clay]] or [[peptide nucleic acid]].<ref name=OrgelLE>{{cite journal | title=The origin of life--a review of facts and speculations| author=Orgel LE| journal=Trends Biochem Sci| year=1998| volume=23| pages=491–5| pmid=9868373 | doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01300-0 | issue=12}}</ref>

The early cell membranes were probably more simple and permeable than modern ones, with only a single fatty acid chain per lipid. Lipids are known to spontaneously form bilayered [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s in water, and could have preceded RNA, but the first cell membranes could also have been produced by catalytic RNA, or even have required structural proteins before they could form.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Griffiths G |title=Cell evolution and the problem of membrane topology |journal=Nature reviews.

===Origin of eukaryotic cells===
{{further|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}
The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a [[symbiosis|symbiotic community]] of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like the [[mitochondria]] and the [[chloroplasts]] are descended from ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing [[proteobacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]], respectively, which were [[Endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosed]] by an ancestral [[archaea]]n prokaryote.

There is still considerable debate about whether organelles like the [[hydrogenosome]] predated the origin of [[mitochondria]], or vice versa: see the [[hydrogen hypothesis]] for the origin of eukaryotic cells.

Sex, as the stereotyped choreography of meiosis and syngamy that persists in nearly all extant eukaryotes, may have played a role in the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. One view, on the origin of sex in eukaryotic cells, is that eukaryotic sex evolved from a prokaryotic sexual process termed transformation. According to this view, bacterial transformation is an adaptation for repairing DNA damages that arise during stressful conditions, and this role has been maintained in meiosis, where recombinational DNA repair is promoted. Thus the adaptive benefit of prokaryotic sex, recombinational repair, was maintained through the evolutionary transition from prokaryotes to single-celled eukaryotes.<ref>Bernstein H, Bernstein C. (2010) Evolutionary Origin of Recombination during Meiosis. BioScience 60(7):498-505. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5</ref><ref>Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE (2012). DNA repair as the primary adaptive function of sex in bacteria and eukaryotes.  Chapter 1: pp.1-49 in: DNA Repair: New Research, Sakura Kimura and Sora Shimizu editors. Nova Sci. Publ., Hauppauge, N.Y.  ISBN 978-1-62100-808-8 https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=31918</ref> This view is also presented in the Wikipedia articles [[Transformation (genetics)]], [[Evolution of sexual reproduction]] and [[Sex]]. 

In another view, an 'origin of sex as vaccination' theory suggests that the eukaryote genome accreted from prokaryan parasite genomes in numerous rounds of lateral gene transfer. Sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose when infected hosts began swapping nuclearized genomes containing co-evolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that conveyed protection against horizontal infection by more virulent symbionts.<ref name="sterrer">{{cite journal | author = Sterrer W | title = On the origin of sex as vaccination | journal =  Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 216 | pages = 387–396 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12151256  | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2002.3008 | issue = 4 }}</ref>

==History of research==
* 1632–1723: [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] teaches himself to make [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], constructs [[simple microscopes]] and draws [[protozoa]], such as ''[[Vorticella]]'' from rain water, and [[Bacterium|bacteria]] from his own mouth.
* 1665: [[Robert Hooke]] discovers cells in cork, then in living plant tissue using an early compound microscope.<ref name="Hooke" />
* 1839: [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] elucidate the principle that plants and animals are made of cells, concluding that cells are a common unit of structure and development, and thus founding the cell theory.
* 1855: [[Rudolf Virchow]] states that new cells come from pre-existing cells by [[cell division]] (''omnis cellula ex cellula'').
* 1859: The belief that life forms can occur spontaneously (''[[Abiogenesis|generatio spontanea]]'') is contradicted by [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) (although [[Francesco Redi]] had performed an experiment in 1668 that suggested the same conclusion).
* 1931: [[Ernst Ruska]] builds the first [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) at the [[University of Berlin]]. By 1935, he has built an EM with twice the resolution of a light microscope, revealing previously unresolvable organelles.
* 1953: [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] made their first announcement on the [[double helix]] structure of DNA on February 28.
* 1981: [[Lynn Margulis]] published ''Symbiosis in Cell Evolution'' detailing the [[endosymbiotic theory]].
