'''Catatonia''' is a state of neurogenic motor immobility, and behavioral abnormality manifested by [[stupor]]. It was first described, in 1874, by [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum]] in ''Die Katatonie oder das Spannungsirresein''<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20080209213229/http://www.entwicklung-der-psychiatrie.de/seiten/24.1_kahlbaum_die_katatonie.htm, Archived copy (Internet Archive)</ref> (''Catatonia or Tension Insanity''). 

In the current ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (DSM-5) catatonia is not recognized as a separate disorder, but is associated with psychiatric conditions such as [[schizophrenia]] (catatonic type), [[bipolar disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[Clinical depression|depression]] and other mental disorders, as well as [[drug abuse]] or [[overdose]] (or both). It may also be seen in many medical disorders including infections (such as [[encephalitis]]), [[autoimmune disorder]]s, focal neurologic lesions (including [[stroke]]s), metabolic disturbances, alcohol withdrawal<ref name="Geoffroy-2012">{{Cite journal | author= Geoffroy PA, Rolland B, Cottencin O. | title = Catatonia and alcohol withdrawal: a complex and underestimated syndrome. | journal = Alcohol Alcohol. | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 288–90 | month =  may-jun| year = 2012 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agr170 | pmid = 22278315 }}</ref> and abrupt or overly rapid [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepine withdrawal]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rosebush PI | coauthors = Mazurek MF. | year = 1996 | month = August | title = Catatonia after benzodiazepine withdrawal | journal = Journal of clinical psychopharmacology. | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 315–9 | pmid = 8835707 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-199608000-00007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Deuschle M, Lederbogen F |title=Benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced catatonia |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=41–2 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11229621 |doi= 10.1055/s-2001-15188|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kanemoto K, Miyamoto T, Abe R |title=Ictal catatonia as a manifestation of de novo absence status epilepticus following benzodiazepine withdrawal |journal=Seizure |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=364–6 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10512781 |doi=10.1053/seiz.1999.0309 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1059-1311(99)90309-6}}</ref>

It can be an adverse reaction to prescribed medication. It bears similarity to conditions such as [[encephalitis lethargica]] and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. There are a variety of treatments available; [[benzodiazepine]]s are a first-line treatment strategy. [[Electro-convulsive therapy]] is also sometimes used. There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of [[NMDA antagonists]] for benzodiazepine resistant catatonia.<ref name="Daniels-2009">{{Cite journal | last1 = Daniels | first1 = J. | title = Catatonia: clinical aspects and neurobiological correlates. | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 371–80 | month =  | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.4.371 | pmid = 19996245 }}</ref> Antipsychotics are sometimes employed but require caution as they can worsen symptoms and have serious adverse effects.<ref name="Fink & Taylor" />

==Clinical features==
Patients with catatonia may experience an extreme loss of motor skill or even constant hyperactive motor activity. Catatonic patients will sometimes hold rigid poses for hours and will ignore any external stimuli. Patients with catatonic excitement can suffer from exhaustion if not treated.  Patients may also show stereotyped, repetitive movements. 

They may show specific types of movement such as [[waxy flexibility]], in which they maintain positions after being placed in them through someone else in which they resist movement in proportion to the force applied by the examiner. They may repeat meaningless phrases or speak only to repeat what the examiner says.

While catatonia is only identified as a symptom of [[schizophrenia]] in present psychiatric classifications, it is increasingly recognized as a syndrome with many faces. It appears as the Kahlbaum syndrome (motionless catatonia), malignant catatonia (neuroleptic malignant syndrome, [[Serotonin_syndrome|toxic serotonin syndrome]]), and excited forms (delirious mania, catatonic excitement, [[oneirophrenia]]).<ref name = "Fink & Taylor">Fink M, Taylor MA: CATATONIA: A Clinician's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment, Cambridge U Press, 2003"</ref> 
It has also been recognized as grafted on to [[autism spectrum disorders]].<ref>Dhossche D et al.: Catatonia in Autism Spectrum Disorders, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2006</ref>

==Diagnostic criteria==
According to the [[DSM-IV]], the "With catatonic features" specifier can be applied if the clinical picture is dominated by at least two of the following:

* motor immobility as evidenced by [[catalepsy]] (including [[waxy flexibility]]) or [[stupor]]
* excessive motor activity (purposeless, not influenced by external stimuli)
* extreme negativism (motiveless resistance to all instructions or maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved) or mutism
* peculiarities of voluntary movement as evidenced by posturing, stereotyped movements, prominent mannerisms, or prominent grimacing
* [[echolalia]] or [[echopraxia]]

===Subtypes===
* '''[[Stupor]]''' is a motionless, [[apathy|apathetic]] state in which one is oblivious or does not react to external [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. [[motor skill|Motor activity]] is nearly non-existent. Individuals in this state make little or no eye contact with others and may be mute and rigid. One might remain in one position for a long period of time, and then go directly to another position immediately after the first position.

* '''Catatonic excitement''' is a state of constant purposeless [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]] and excitation. Individuals in this state are extremely hyperactive, although, as aforementioned, the activity seems to lack purpose. It is commonly cited as one of the most dangerous mental states in psychiatry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Maric |first=J.|title=Clinical Psychiatry |publisher=Nolit, Belgrade|year=2000}}</ref>

*'''Malignant catatonia''' is an acute onset of excitement, fever, autonomic instability, delirium and may be fatal.<ref>Semple,David."oxford hand book of psychiatry" Oxford press. 2005.</ref>

===Catatonia rating scale===
Fink and Taylor developed a catatonia rating scale to identify the syndrome.<ref name="Fink & Taylor" /> A diagnosis is verified by a [[benzodiazepine]] or [[barbiturate]] test. The diagnosis is validated by the quick response to either benzodiazepines or [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). While proven useful in the past, barbiturates are no longer commonly used in [[psychiatry]]; thus the option of either benzodiazepines or ECT.

==Treatment==
Initial treatment is aimed at providing symptomatic relief. [[Benzodiazepine]]s are the first line of treatment, and high doses are often required. A test dose of 1–2&nbsp;mg of intramuscular [[lorazepam]] will often result in marked improvement within half an hour. In France, [[zolpidem]] has also been used in diagnosis, and response may occur within the same time period. Ultimately the underlying cause needs to be treated.<ref name="Fink & Taylor" />

[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) is an effective treatment for catatonia as well as for most of the underlying causes (e.g. [[psychosis]], [[mania]], [[clinical depression|depression]]). [[Antipsychotic]]s should be used with care as they can worsen catatonia and are the cause of [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], a dangerous condition that can mimic catatonia and requires immediate discontinuation of the antipsychotic.<ref name="Fink & Taylor" />

Excessive [[glutamate]] activity is believed to be involved in catatonia; when first-line treatment options fail, [[NMDA antagonists]] such as [[amantadine]] or [[memantine]] are used. Amantadine may have an increased incidence of tolerance with prolonged use and can cause psychosis, due to its additional effects on the dopamine system. Memantine has a more targeted pharmacological profile for the glutamate system, reduced incidence of psychosis and may therefore be preferred for individuals who cannot tolerate amantadine. [[Topiramate]], is another treatment option for resistant catatonia; it produces its therapeutic effects by producing glutamate antagonism via modulation of AMPA receptors.<ref name="Carroll-2007">{{Cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = BT. | last2 = Goforth | first2 = HW. | last3 = Thomas | first3 = C. | last4 = Ahuja | first4 = N. | last5 = McDaniel | first5 = WW. | last6 = Kraus | first6 = MF. | last7 = Spiegel | first7 = DR. | last8 = Franco | first8 = KN. | last9 = Pozuelo | first9 = L. | title = Review of adjunctive glutamate antagonist therapy in the treatment of catatonic syndromes. | url = http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/19/4/406 | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 406–12 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.19.4.406 | pmid = 18070843 }}</ref>
