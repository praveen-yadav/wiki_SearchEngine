'''Agent Orange''' or Herbicide Orange (HO) is one of the [[herbicide]]s and [[defoliant]]s used by the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] as part of its [[herbicidal warfare]] program, [[Operation Ranch Hand]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Buckingham|title=The Air Force and Herbicides|url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100928-054.pdf|publisher=AFHSO}}</ref> during the [[Vietnam War]] from 1961 to 1971.  It was a mixture of equal parts of two herbicdes, [[2,4,5-T]] and [[2,4-D]].

Agent Orange was manufactured for the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] primarily by [[Monsanto Corporation]] and [[Dow Chemical]].  It was given its name from the color of the orange-striped [[Drum (container)|barrels]] in which it was shipped, and was by far the most widely used of the so-called "[[Rainbow Herbicides]]".<ref name="hay-1982-p151" />

During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed nearly {{convert|20000000|USgal|l|sigfig=2}} of material containing chemical herbicides and defoliants mixed with [[jet fuel]] in Vietnam, eastern [[Laos]] and parts of [[Cambodia]], as part of [[Operation Ranch Hand]].<ref name="pellow-2007-159">Pellow, David N.

The US began to target food crops in October 1962, primarily using [[Agent Blue]].

The urban population in South Vietnam nearly tripled: from 2.8 million people in 1958, to 8 million by 1971. The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled [[urbanization]]; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in [[Saigon]] [[slums]].<ref name="pp. 4">Luong, 2003: [http://books.google.com/books?id=AkIhYEavBrEC&pg=PA4 pp. 4]</ref>

The [[2,4,5-T]] used to produce Agent Orange was contaminated with [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]] (TCDD), an extremely toxic [[dioxin compound]].

Chemically, Agent Orange is an approximately 1:1 mixture of two [[phenoxyl herbicide]]s – [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] ('''2,4-D''') and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] ('''2,4,5-T''') – in [[ester|iso-octyl ester]] form.<ref>IOM, 1994: [http://books.google.com/books?id=2YQTHJlt5l4C&pg=PA90 p. 90]</ref>

Numerous studies have examined health effects linked to Agent Orange, its component compounds, and its manufacturing byproducts.<ref name="frumkin">Frumkin, 2003: [http://caonline.amcancersoc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12924777 pp.245–255]</ref>

Prior to the controversy surrounding Agent Orange, there was already a large body of scientific evidence linking 2,4,5-T to serious negative health effects and ecological damage.<ref>Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&pg=PA2 p. 2]</ref> But in 1969, it was revealed to the public that the 2,4,5-T was contaminated with a dioxin, [[tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]] ('''TCDD'''), and that the TCDD was causing many of the previously unexplained adverse health effects which were correlated with Agent Orange exposure.<ref>Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&pg=PA6 p. 6]</ref> TCDD has been described as "perhaps the most toxic molecule ever synthesized by man".<ref name="Schuck">Schuck, 1987: [http://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&pg=PA18 p. 18]</ref> Internal memoranda revealed that Monsanto (a major manufacturer of 2,4,5-T) had informed the U.S. government in 1952 that its 2,4,5-T was contaminated.<ref name="Schuck2"/> In the manufacture of 2,4,5-T, accidental overheating of the reaction mixture easily causes the product to condense into the toxic self-condensation product TCDD. At the time, precautions were not taken against this unintended side reaction, which caused also the [[Seveso disaster]] in Italy in 1976.

In 1979, the Yale [[biologist]] Arthur Galston, who specialized in herbicide research, published a review of what was known at the time about the toxicity of TCDD. Even "vanishingly small" quantities of dioxin in the diet caused adverse health effects when [[animal testing|tested on animals]].<ref name="Schuck" /> Since then, TCDD has been comprehensively studied. It has been associated with increased [[neoplasms]] in every animal [[bioassay]] reported in the scientific literature.<ref name="dwyer-flesch">Dwyer and Flesch-Janys, [http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/reprint/85/4/476.pdf "Editorial: Agent Orange in Vietnam"], [[American Journal of Public Health]], April 1995, Vol 85. No. 4, p. 476</ref> The National Toxicology Program has classified TCDD as "known to be a human [[carcinogen]]", frequently associated with [[soft tissue sarcoma|soft-tissue sarcoma]], [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm?objectid=D3D7DB18-F1F6-975E-716813304ED78D8B |title=Committee Recommendations: 2,3,7,8- Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) |publisher=Ntp.niehs.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref><ref>NTP, 2006: {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

A 1969 report authored by K. Diane Courtney and others found 2,4,5-T could cause birth defects and stillbirths in mice.<ref>Buckingham, 1992: ''Chapter IX – Ranch Hand Ends''</ref> Several studies have shown an increased rate of cancer mortality for workers exposed to 2,4,5-T.

==Early development==
In 1943, plant biologist [[Arthur Galston]] began studying the compound [[triiodobenzoic acid]] as a plant [[growth hormone]], in an attempt to adapt [[soybean]]s to a short growing season. Galston applied a low dose of the substance on a Soybean plant. The plant presented with flowering and accelerated growth when compared to a control. However, applied in excess, the plant would respond with catastrophic defoliation&nbsp;— a finding later used by his colleague Ian Sussex to develop the family of herbicides used in Operation Ranch Hand.<ref>Pearce, Jeremy; [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/us/23galston.html?ref=us Arthur Galston, Agent Orange Researcher, Is Dead at 88 – Obituary] ''New York Times'', June 23, 2008 (accessed August 18, 2008)</ref> Galston was especially concerned about the compound's side effects to humans and the environment.<ref name="galston-light">Peterson, Doug [http://www.las.illinois.edu/alumni/magazine/articles/2004/galston Arthur W. Galston: Matters of Light], ''LASNews Magazine'', [[University of Illinois]], Spring 2005</ref>

In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army contracted the [[University of Chicago]] to study the effects of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the [[Bushnell Army Airfield]] in [[Florida]], which is now listed as a [[Formerly Used Defense Site]] (FUDS).<ref>Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&pg=PA24 p.24]</ref><ref name="p. 111">Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&pg=PA111 p. 111]</ref>

During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed nearly {{convert|20000000|USgal|l|sigfig=3}} of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia, as part of the aerial defoliation program known as [[Operation Ranch Hand]].<ref name="pellow-2007-159" /><ref name="stellman-2003-681-687" /> The goal was to defoliate rural/forested land, depriving guerrillas of food and cover and clearing sensitive areas such as around base perimeters.<ref>Tucker, Spencer.

Spraying was usually done either from helicopters or from low-flying [[C-123 Provider]] aircraft, fitted with sprayers and "MC-1 Hourglass" pump systems and {{convert|1000|USgal|L|abbr=on}} chemical tanks. Spray runs were also conducted from trucks, boats, and backpack sprayers.<ref>Schuck, 1987: [http://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&pg=PA16 p. 16]</ref><ref>[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/IntheWorkplace/agent-orange-and-cancer?sitearea=PED Agent Orange and Cancer], ''American Cancer Society'', 2010</ref><ref>Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&pg=PA26 p. 26]</ref>

The first batch of herbicides was unloaded at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]] in South Vietnam, on January 9, 1962.<ref name="hay-1982-p151">Hay, 1982: [http://books.google.com/books?id=V524J4zh06MC&pg=PA151 p. 151]</ref> Air Force records show at least 6,542 spraying missions took place over the course of Operation Ranch Hand.<ref name="Furukawa 2004 143"/> By 1971, 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, at an average concentration of 13 times the recommended USDA application rate for domestic use.<ref name="sbsg-1971-p36" /> In South Vietnam alone, an estimated 10 million [[hectares]] of agricultural land were ultimately destroyed.<ref name="luong-2003-p3" /> In some areas, TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref name="fawthrop-war-against" /><ref name="fawthrop-suffering" />

The campaign destroyed {{convert|5|e6acre|km2|sigfig=1}} of upland and mangrove forests and millions of acres of crops. Overall, more than 20% of South Vietnam's forests were sprayed at least once over a nine-year period.<ref name="kolko-144-145"/><ref name="verwey-113" />

In 1965, members of the U.S. Congress were told "crop destruction is understood to be the more important purpose&nbsp;... but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle defoliation in public mention of the program."<ref name="verwey-113">Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&pg=PA113 p. 113]</ref> Soldiers were told they were destroying crops because they were going to be used to feed guerrillas. They later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas; it was, in reality, only being grown to support the local civilian population. For example, in Quang Ngai province, 85% of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in 1970 alone. This contributed to widespread famine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starving.<ref>Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&pg=PA116 p. 116]</ref>

The U.S. military began targeting food crops in October 1962, primarily using [[Agent Blue]]; the American public was not made aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the [[State Department]] in March 1966.<ref name="kolko-144-145" /><ref name="p. 111"/>

Many experts at the time, including Arthur Galston, the biologist who developed and intensively studied 2,4,5-T and TCDD, opposed herbicidal warfare, due to concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area. As early as 1966, resolutions were introduced to the [[United Nations]] charging that the U.S. was violating the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]], which regulated the use of chemical and biological weapons.<ref name="galston-light" /><ref>Schuck, 1987: [http://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&pg=PA19 p. 19]</ref>

The Vietnam Red Cross reported as many as 3 million Vietnamese people have been affected by Agent Orange, including at least 150,000 children born with birth defects.<ref name="va-03-2010" /> According to Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 4.8 million Vietnamese people were exposed to Agent Orange, resulting in 400,000 people being killed or maimed, and 500,000 children born with birth defects.<ref name="last-ghost" /> Women had higher rates of miscarriage and stillbirths, as did livestock such as cattle, water buffalo, and pigs.<ref>{{cite video | title=Interview with Ton-That Tung, 1981 | url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-4798f7-interview-with-ton-that-tung-1981 | publisher=WGBH Media Library and Archives | date=2 February 1981}}</ref>

Children in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and [[Polydactyly|extra fingers and toes]].<ref name="Agent Orange blights Vietnam"/> In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the [[breast milk]] of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. soldiers who had served in Vietnam.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Thornton|first=Joe|title=Pandora's Poison: Chlorine, Health, and a New Environmental Strategy|publisher=MIT Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-262-70084-9|page=190|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n_tXscNndysC&pg=PA190}}</ref> The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia.

About 28 of the former US military bases in Vietnam where the herbicides were stored and loaded onto airplanes may still have high level of dioxins in the soil, posing a health threat to the surrounding communities. Extensive testing for dioxin contamination has been conducted at the former US airbases in Da Nang, Phu Cat and Bien Hoa. Some of the soil and sediment on the bases have extremely high levels of dioxin requiring remediation. The Da Nang Airbase has dioxin contamination up to 350 times higher than international recommendations for action.<ref>Hatfield Consultants.

====Ecological effects====
About 17.8% (3,100,000 ha) of the total forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which dramatically disrupted ecological equilibrium. Furthermore, the persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of protective tree cover, and loss of seeding forest stock, meant reforestation was difficult or impossible in many areas.<ref>Furukawa, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=jPL4wSfgan4C&pg=PA215 p. 215]</ref> Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species, such as [[bamboo]] and [[cogon grass]], which make it unlikely the forests will be able to regenerate. Animal species [[biodiversity|diversity]] was also significantly impacted: in one study, a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and 5 species of [[mammals]] in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chiras, Daniel D.|title=Environmental science|year=2010|edition=8th|publisher=Jones & Bartlett|isbn=978-0-7637-5925-4|page=499|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L28bHnPXo1AC&pg=PA499}}</ref>

Dioxins from Agent Orange have persisted in the Vietnamese environment since the war, settling in the soil and sediment and entering into food chain through the animals and fish that feed in the contaminated areas. Movement of dioxins through the [[food web]] has resulted in [[bioconcentration]] and [[biomagnification]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Vallero, Daniel A.|title=Biomedical ethics for engineers: ethics and decision making in biomedical and biosystem engineering|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-7506-8227-5|page=73|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AeT56Pi8LFYC&pg=PA73}}</ref> The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are the sites of former U.S. air bases.<ref>Furukawa, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=jPL4wSfgan4C&pg=PA221 pp. 221–222]</ref>

====Sociopolitical effects====
The [[RAND Corporation]]'s ''Memorandum 5446-ISA/ARPA'' states: "the fact that the VC obtain most of their food from the neutral rural population dictates the destruction of civilian crops&nbsp;... if they (the VC) are to be hampered by the crop destruction program, it will be necessary to destroy large portions of the rural economy – probably 50% or more".<ref>Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&pg=PA115 p.115]</ref>

Rural-to-urban migration rates dramatically increased in South Vietnam, as peasants escaped the war in the countryside by fleeing to the cities. The urban population in South Vietnam nearly tripled, growing from 2.8 million people in 1958 to 8 million by 1971. The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled urbanization; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in Saigon slums.<ref name="pp. 4"/>

===Effects on U.S. veterans===
Some studies showed that veterans who served in the South during the war have increased rates of cancer, and nerve, digestive, skin and respiratory disorders. Veterans from the south had higher rates of throat cancer, acute/chronic leukemia, [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, soft tissue sarcoma and liver cancer. With the exception of liver cancer, these are the same conditions the US Veterans Administration has determined may be associated with exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, and are on the list of conditions eligible for compensation and treatment.<ref name="va-03-2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/diseases.asp |title=Agent Orange: Diseases Associated with Agent Orange Exposure |publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 4, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100509191150/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/diseases.asp| archivedate= 9 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Military personnel who loaded airplanes and helicopters used in Ranch Hand probably sustained some of the heaviest exposures. Members of the [[Army Chemical Corps]], who stored and mixed herbicides and defoliated the perimeters of military bases, and mechanics who worked on the helicopters and planes, are also thought to have had some of the heaviest exposures. However, this same group of individuals has not shown remarkably higher incidences of the associated diseases. Others with potentially heavy exposures included members of [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] units who defoliated remote campsites, and members of [[U.S. Navy]] river units who cleared base perimeters.<ref>Frumkin, 2003: p. 3</ref>  Military members who served on [[Okinawa]] also claim to have been exposed to the chemical but there is no verifiable evidence to corroborate these claims.<ref>Mitchell, Jon, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110412zg.html Evidence for Agent Orange on Okinawa]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 12 April 2011, p. 12.</ref>

While in Vietnam, the veterans were told not to worry, and were persuaded the chemical was harmless.<ref>Hermann, Kenneth J.; [http://politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/3299/ "Killing Me Softly: How Agent Orange Murders Vietnam's Children"]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}, ''Political Affairs'', April 25, 2006</ref> After returning home, Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects might be related to Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they were exposed in Vietnam. Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge.

By April 1993, the Department of Veterans Affairs had only compensated 486 victims, although it had received disability claims from 39,419 soldiers who had been exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Fleischer|first1=Doris Zames|last2=Zames|first2=Freida|title=The disability rights movement: from charity to confrontation|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-56639-812-1|page=178|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3t84d8tLEVcC&pg=PA178}}</ref>

===Legal and diplomatic proceedings===

====US veterans class action lawsuit against manufacturers====
Since at least 1978, several lawsuits have been filed against the companies which produced Agent Orange, among them [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]], [[Monsanto Company|Monsanto]], and [[Diamond Shamrock]].

[[Hy Mayerson]] of [[The Mayerson Law Offices, P.C.]] was an early pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with [[environmentalism|environmental attorney]] [[Victor Yannacone]] in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, one of the first civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor.<ref name="ReferenceA">Wilcox, 1983: {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Wilbur J.|title=The Politics of Readjustment: Vietnam Veterans Since the War|publisher=Transaction|year=1993|isbn=978-0-202-30406-9|page=130|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YLg8rVfYO9EC&pg=PA130}}</ref>

The Mayerson law firm, with Sgt. [[Charles E. Hartz]] as their principal client, filed the first U.S. Agent Orange class-action lawsuit, in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1980, for the injuries soldiers in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the [[defoliant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1347&dat=19800125&id=ZdMSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0_oDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5065,3012612 |title='&#39;Dying Veteran May Speak From Beyond The Grave In Court: Lakeland Ledger |publisher=News.google.com |date=1980-01-25 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> Attorney Hy Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability action as a [[class action]], the largest ever filed as of its filing.<ref>Croft, Steve; [http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=270939 Agent Orange], ''CBS Evening News'', May 7, 1980</ref> Hartz's [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] was one of the first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving [[testimony]] at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of a [[brain tumor]] that began to develop while he was a member of [[Tiger Force]], [[Special Forces]], and [[LRRPs]] in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayerson.com/html/about.html |title=The Mayerson Law Offices |publisher=The Mayerson Law Offices |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pottsmerc.com/ |title=Pottstown Mercury |publisher=Pottsmerc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Ronald A. Codario, M.D., including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The chemical companies involved denied that there was a link between Agent Orange and the veterans' medical problems.  However, on May 7, 1984, seven chemical companies settled the class-action suit out of court just hours before jury selection was to begin.  The companies agreed to pay $180 million as compensation if the veterans dropped all claims against them.  Slightly over 45% of the sum was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone.<ref>{{Cite book|editors=Stanley, Jay; Blair, John D.|title=Challenges in military health care: perspectives on health status and the provision of care| publisher=Transaction Publishers| year=1993|isbn=978-1-56000-650-3|page=164| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8k-WIJYwIF4C&pg=PA164}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Harrington|first=John C.|title=The challenge to power: money, investing, and democracy|publisher=Chelsea Green Publisher|year=2005|isbn=978-1-931498-97-5|page=260|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wGgeiQvijI8C&pg=PT260}}</ref> Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court, and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers. "Fairness Hearings" were held in five major American cities, where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement, and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts, demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers. Federal Judge Julius Weinstein refused the appeals, claiming the settlement was "fair and just". By 1989, the veterans' fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out. A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of $12,000 spread out over the course of 10 years. Furthermore, by accepting the settlement payments, disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement, such as food stamps, public assistance, and government pensions. A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would only receive $3700.<ref name="oxford-milhist-725">{{Cite book|editor=Chambers, John Whiteclay|editor2=Anderson, Fred|title=The Oxford companion to American military history|chapter=Toxic Agents: Agent Orange Exposure|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999| isbn=978-0-19-507198-6|page=725| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_Rzy_yNMKbcC&pg=PA725}}</ref>

In 2004, Monsanto spokesman Jill Montgomery said Monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by Agent Orange, saying: "We are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause, but reliable scientific evidence indicates that Agent Orange is not the cause of serious long-term health effects."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Agent Orange Victims Sue Monsanto| last=Fawthrop|first=Tom| work=CorpWatch|date=November 4, 2004|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11638}}</ref>

====New Jersey Agent Orange Commission====
In 1980, [[New Jersey]] created the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission, the first state commission created to study its effects. The commission's research project in association with [[Rutgers University]] was called "The Pointman Project". It was disbanded by Governor [[Christine Todd Whitman]] in 1996.<ref>New York Times, July 3, 1996{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}</ref>

During Pointman I, commission researchers devised ways to determine small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels could only be found in the [[adipose tissue|adipose (fat) tissue]]. The project studied dioxin ([[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]]) levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the levels were found to be higher in the former group.<ref>[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=371123 "Dioxins and Dibenzofurans in Blood and Adipose Tissue of Agent Orange—Exposed Vietnam Veterans and Matched Controls"], ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', Vol. 259 No. 11, March 18, 1988, p. 1661–1667</ref>

The second phase of the project continued to examine and compare dioxin levels in various groups of Vietnam veterans, including [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and [[Brownwater Navy|brown water riverboat Navy]] personnel.

====US Congress====
In 1991, the US Congress enacted the [[Agent Orange Act]], giving the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] the authority to declare certain conditions 'presumptive' to exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.va.gov/AgentOrange/ |title=Agent Orange – Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards |publisher=.va.gov |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> The same law required the National Academy of Sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the Secretary of Veterans Affairs about the strength of the scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin and certain conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/laws/PL102-4.asp |title=PL 102-4 and The National Academy of Sciences |publisher=.nationalacademies.org |date=1981-11-03 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>

Through this process, the list of 'presumptive' conditions has grown since 1991, and currently the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, type II diabetes, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, [[chloracne]], porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide. This list now includes B cell leukemias, such as hairy cell leukemia, Parkinson's disease and ischemic heart disease, these last three having been added on August 31, 2010. Several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should, in fact, actually have been included.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2010/08/ap-aging-vets-concern-083110/|title=Costs of aging vets concern deficit commission|last=Baker|first=Mike|date=September 2, 2010|work=The Air Force Times|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref>

====U.S.–Vietnamese government negotiations====
In 2002, Vietnam and the US held a joint conference on Human Health and Environmental Impacts of Agent Orange. Following the conference, the US [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] (NIEHS) began scientific exchanges between the US and Vietnam, and began discussions for a joint research project on the human health impacts of Agent Orange.<ref name="p. 310">Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&pg=PA310 p. 310]</ref>

These negotiations broke down in 2005, when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was cancelled. More progress has been made on the environmental front. In 2005, the first US-Vietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held.<ref name="p. 310"/>

Starting in 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) began to work with the Vietnamese government to measure the level of dioxin at the [[Da Nang Airbase]]. Also in 2005, the Joint Advisory Committee on Agent Orange, made up of representatives of Vietnamese and US government agencies, was established. The committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation, technical assistance and environmental remediation of dioxin.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/pr081209.html|title = US, Vietnam to Hold Fourth Joint Advisory Meeting on Agent Orange/Dioxin |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

A breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred as a result of United States President George W. Bush's state visit to Vietnam in November 2006. In the joint statement, President Bush and [[President Triet]] agreed "further joint efforts to address the environmental contamination near former dioxin storage sites would make a valuable contribution to the continued development of their bilateral relationship."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eap/rls/prs/76322.htm |title=Joint Statement Between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the United States of America |last1= Bush |first1=George |last2= Triet |first2=Nguyen Minh |date=November 17, 2006 |website=U.S Department of State |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary |accessdate=28 September 2013}}</ref>

In late May 2007, President Bush signed into law a supplemental spending bill for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan that included an earmark of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin 'hotspots' on former US military bases, and for public health programs for the surrounding communities;<ref>Martin, May 2009: p. 2</ref> some authors consider this to be completely inadequate, pointing out that the U.S. airbase in [[Da Nang]], alone, will cost $14 million to clean up, and that three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup.<ref name="fawthrop-suffering" /> The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010. An additional $12 million was appropriated in the fiscal year 2010 in the Supplemental Appropriations Act and a total of $18.5 million appropriated for fiscal year 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://leahy.senate.gov/press/press_releases/release/?id=aaea045d-2239-4e5d-bc0e-87575d887daa |title = Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy on the Legacy of Agent Orange |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated during a visit to Hanoi in October 2010 that the US government would begin work on the clean-up of dioxin contamination at the Da Nang airbase.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2010/October/20101031105353su0.604421.html&distid=ucs#ixzz1413KqPVs |title = Remarks by Secretary Clinton, Vietnam Foreign Minister Khiem |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

In June 2011 a ceremony was held at Da Nang airport to mark the start of US-funded decontamination of dioxin hotspots in Vietnam. $32m has so far been allocated by the US congress to fund the program.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13808753 | work=BBC News | title=US helps Vietnam to eradicate deadly Agent Orange | date=June 17, 2011}}</ref>

====Vietnamese victims class action lawsuit in U.S. courts====
On January 31, 2004, a [[victim's rights group]], the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] in [[Brooklyn]], against several U.S. companies for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing the chemical, and claimed that the use of Agent Orange violated the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare]], 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]], and the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]]. Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge [[Jack B. Weinstein]] of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 US veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the [[plaintiff|plaintiffs']] claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under [[international law]] at the time of its use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government.<ref>[http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_us_rule76 United States of America Practice Relating to Rule 76. Herbicides]</ref> The U.S. government was not a party in the lawsuit, due to [[sovereign immunity]], and the court ruled the chemical companies, as contractors of the US government, shared the same immunity. The case was appealed and heard by the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] on June 18, 2007. The Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal of the case, stating the herbicides used during the war were not intended to be used to poison humans and therefore did not violate international law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warlegacies.org/Agent%20Orange/Appealdecision.pdf |title=February 22, 2008 Decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals re: Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange v.

Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan heard the appeal on June 18, 2007. They upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the herbicides contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the US Supreme Court to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]] and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/030209zor.pdf |title=Order List |format=PDF |date=March 2, 2009 |page=7 |publisher=The United States Supreme Court |accessdate=May 4, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100605051419/http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/030209zor.pdf| archivedate= 5 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In a November 2004 [[Zogby International]] poll of 987 people, 79% of respondents thought the US chemical companies which produced Agent Orange defoliant should compensate US soldiers who were affected by the toxic chemical used during the war in Vietnam. Also, 51% said they supported compensation for Vietnamese Agent Orange victims.<ref>{{cite web|title=Most Americans favor compensation for Agent Orange victims|url=http://vietnamembassy-usa.org/relations/most-americans-favor-compensation-agent-orange-victims|last1=Nguyen|first1=H.|date=19 November 2004|website=Embassy of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the United States|publisher=Thanh Nien News|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>

===Help for those affected in Vietnam===
To assist those who have been affected by Agent Orange/dioxin, the Vietnamese have established "peace villages", which each host between 50 and 100 victims, giving them medical and psychological help. As of 2006, there were 11 such villages, thus granting some social protection to fewer than a thousand victims. U.S. veterans of the war in Vietnam and individuals who are aware and sympathetic to the impacts of Agent Orange have supported these programs in Vietnam. An international group of veterans from the U.S. and its allies during the Vietnam War working with their former enemy&nbsp;— veterans from the Vietnam Veterans Association&nbsp;— established the Vietnam Friendship Village<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.vietnamfriendship.org |title = Vietnam Friendship Village Project |accessdate=August 18, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080917012142/http://www.vietnamfriendship.org/| archivedate= 17 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> outside of [[Hanoi]].

The center provides medical care, rehabilitation and vocational training for children and veterans from Vietnam who have been affected by Agent Orange. In 1998, The [[Vietnam Red Cross]] established the Vietnam Agent Orange Victims Fund to provide direct assistance to families throughout Vietnam that have been affected. In 2003, the [[Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange]] (VAVA) was formed. In addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies, VAVA provides medical care, rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by Agent Orange.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.vava.org.vn/modules.php?name=News&op=viewcat&catid=25 |title = Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

The Vietnamese government provides small monthly stipends to more than 200,000 Vietnamese believed affected by the herbicides; this totaled $40.8 million in 2008 alone. The Vietnam Red Cross has raised more than $22 million to assist the ill or disabled, and several U.S. foundations, United Nations agencies, European governments and nongovernmental organizations have given a total of about $23 million for site cleanup, reforestation, health care and other services to those in need.<ref>Statement by Amb.

==Use outside Vietnam==
While 'Agent Orange' was only used between 1965 and 1970, 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T and other herbicides were used by the US military from the late 1940s through the 1970s. There is, however, no scientific evidence that these herbicides contained the same levels of dioxin as those used in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Rossie |url=http://www.bluewaternavy.org/ |title=Agent Orange information site |publisher=Bluewaternavy.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluewaternavy.org/bases/1Herbicides_Outside_of_Vietnam%5B1%5D.pdf |title=Specifics of Agent Orange use |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>

===Australia===
'''''Queensland'''''

In 2008, Australian researcher Jean Williams claimed that cancer rates in the town of Innisfail, Queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War. Williams, who had won the Order of Australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S. war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial's archives. A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, saying that he had been involved in the secret testing. Neither Williams or Bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims. The Queensland health department determined that cancer rates in Innisfail were no higher than those in other parts of the state.<ref>McMahon, Barbara; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/19/australia "Australia cancer deaths linked to Agent Orange"], ''Guardian'', May 19, 2008</ref>

On February 17, 2011, the [[Toronto Star]] revealed that the same chemicals used to strip the jungles of Vietnam were also employed to clear extensive plots of [[Crown land]] in [[Northern Ontario]].<ref name="StarExclusive">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/940243--star-exclusive-agent-orange-soaked-ontario-teens|title=Star Exclusive: Agent Orange "soaked" Ontario teens by Diana Zlomislic|accessdate=February 17, 2011 | location=Toronto|work=The Star|date=February 17, 2011}}</ref> The same day, in response to the Toronto Star article, the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario provincial government]] launched a probe into the use of Agent Orange.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/940878--ontario-probes-agent-orange-poisoning|title=Ontario probes Agent Orange poisoning by Diana Zlomislic|accessdate=February 17, 2011 | location=Toronto|work=The Star|date=February 17, 2011}}</ref>

The Toronto Star reported that, "records from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s show forestry workers, often students and junior rangers, spent weeks at a time as human markers holding red, helium-filled balloons on fishing lines while low-flying planes sprayed toxic herbicides including an infamous chemical mixture known as Agent Orange on the brush and the boys below."<ref name="StarExclusive" />

'''''British Columbia'''''

Records show tens of thousands of gallons of the toxic mixture were applied to clear brush near highways and along power lines in the late 1960s and early 1970s – and in some cases the substance was sprayed next to homes. In B.C., the mix of 2-4-D and 2-4-5-T was called "Type B Weed and Brush Killer" in government invoices. Sometimes, the engineers ordered 2-4-5-T by itself, and dubbed it "Type C Weed and Brush Killer."

In total, about 26,000 gallons of Type B Weed and Brush Killer were ordered between 1965 and 1972. About 10,000 gallons of Type C Weed and Brush Killer were ordered in the same time period. The barrels were shipped to all four of the regions of B.C. as designated by the Ministry of Highways: Kamloops, Nelson, Prince George and Vancouver.

In 1976, documents from BC Hydro show 2-4-5-T and 2-4-D was sprayed along Hydro lines Vernon-Monashee and Nicola-Brenda circuits. The documents also say "brushkiller" was sprayed in Pemberton and Daisy Lake.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bc.ctvnews.ca/toxic-agent-orange-sprayed-in-b-c-documents-1.791471 | title=Toxic 'Agent Orange' sprayed in B.C.: documents}}</ref>

===Guam===
An analysis of chemicals present in the island’s soil together with resolutions passed by Guam’s legislature suggest that Agent Orange was among the herbicides routinely used on and around [[Anderson Air Force Base]].  Despite the evidence, the Department of Defense continues to deny that Agent Orange was ever stored or used on Guam.  Several Guam veterans have collected an enormous amount of evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as 2,4,5-T which are similar to the illness associations and disability coverage that has become standard for those who were harmed by the same chemical contaminant of Agent Orange used in Vietnam.<ref name="Dimond2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-hero-project/articles/2013/09/25/were-vets-who-served-in-guam-exposed-to-agent-orange-and-denied-benefits.html |title=Were Vets Who Served in Guam Exposed to Agent Orange and Denied Benefits? |last1= Dimond |first1=Diane |date=September 25, 2013  |website= The Hero Project |publisher=The Daily Beast |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>

In January 2006, the South Korean Appeals Court ordered Dow Chemical and Monsanto to pay $62 million in compensation to about 6,800 people. The ruling acknowledged that "the [[defendant]]s failed to ensure safety as the defoliants manufactured by the defendants had higher levels of dioxins than standard", and, quoting the U.S. National Academy of Science report, declared that there was a "causal relationship" between Agent Orange and 11 diseases, including cancers of the lung, larynx and prostate.

Currently, veterans who provide evidence meeting VA requirements for service in Vietnam, and who can medically establish that anytime after this 'presumptive exposure' they developed any medical problems on the list of presumptive diseases, may receive compensation from the VA. Certain veterans who served in Korea and are able to prove they were assigned to certain specified around the DMZ during a specific time frame are afforded similar presumption.<ref>38 CFR 3.307(a)(6)(iv)</ref> The differences in requirements between Vietnam and Korea service stem from the fact that congress has not made any laws to provide for the same sweeping presumption of exposure similar to the Agent Orange Act of 1991 for Korean veterans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===New Zealand===
The use of Agent Orange has been controversial in New Zealand, because of the exposure of New Zealand troops in Vietnam and because of the production of Agent Orange for Vietnam and other users at an Ivon Watkins-Dow chemical plant in Paritutu, [[New Plymouth]].

Vietnam-era Veterans whose service involved duty on or near the perimeters of military bases in Thailand anytime between February 28, 1961 and May 7, 1975 may have been exposed to herbicides and may qualify for VA benefits. A claim for direct exposure is possible if the individual can verify that they worked or lived in close proximity to the affected areas of the bases in Thailand.

A declassified Department of Defense report written in 1973, suggests that there was a significant use of herbicides on the fenced-in perimeters of military bases in Thailand to remove foliage that provided cover for enemy forces.<ref>[http://www.afhra.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080819-065.pdf Project CHECO Southeast Asia Report: Base Defense in Thailand 1968–1972] (8.3 MB, PDF)</ref>

In 2013 VA determined that herbicides used on the Thailand base perimeters may have been tactical and procured from Vietnam, or a strong, commercial type resembling tactical herbicides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/thailand.asp |title=Thailand Military Bases and Agent Orange Exposure |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref>

===United States===
The University of Hawaii has acknowledged extensive testing of Agent Orange on behalf of the United States Department of Defense in Hawaii along with mixtures of Agent Orange on Kaua'i Island in 1967-68 and on Hawaii Island in 1966; testing and storage in other U.S. locations has been documented by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.<ref>http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/03/27/editorial/special2.html</ref><ref>http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/outside_vietnam_usa.asp</ref>

In 1971, the C-123 aircraft used for spraying Agent Orange were returned to the United States and assigned various East Coast USAF Reserve squadrons, and then employed in traditional airlift missions between 1972 and 1982. In 1994, testing by the Air Force identified some former spray aircraft as "heavily contaminated" with dioxin residue. Inquiries by aircrew veterans in 2011 brought a decision by the US Department of Veterans Affairs opining that not enough dioxin residue remained to injure these post-Vietnam War veterans. On 26 January 2012, the US Center For Disease Control's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry challenged this with their finding that former spray aircraft were indeed contaminated and the aircrews exposed to harmful levels of dioxin.

In 1978, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suspended spraying of Agent Orange in [[U.S. National Forest|National Forests]].<ref>Nicosia and Swofford, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=5hq2_JFvV0kC&pg=PA446 p. 446]</ref>

A December 2006 Department of Defense report listed Agent Orange testing, storage, and disposal sites at 32 locations throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, Thailand, Puerto Rico, Korea, and in the Pacific Ocean.<ref>Young, 2006: pp. 5–6</ref> The Veteran Administration has also acknowledged that Agent Orange was used domestically by U.S. forces in test sites throughout the US. [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in Florida was one of the primary testing sites throughout the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report on DoD Herbicides Outside of Vietnam|url = http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/agentorange/dod_herbicides_outside_vietnam.pdf|author=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=September 7, 2008}}</ref>
