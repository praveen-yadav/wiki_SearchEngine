The '''Lhop''' or '''Doya people''' are a little-known tribe of southwest [[Bhutan]].  The Bhutanese believe them to be the [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] inhabitants of the country, although this claim has not been substantiated by anthropologists. The Lhop are found in the low valleys of [[Samtse]] and near [[Phuntsholing]] in the [[Duars]]. They are also known as the Lhops, Lhopu, or Lhokpu and speak a [[Tibeto-Burman]] language.  They total approximately 2,500 persons.

The dress of the Lhop resembles the [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]], but they bear little similarity with the [[Bhutia]] in the North and the [[Toto tribe|Toto]] in the west. The Doya trace their descent [[matrilineality|matrilineally]], marry their [[cross cousin]]s, and embalm the deceased who are then placed in a foetal position in a circular sarcophagus above the ground. They follow a blend of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] mixed with [[animism]].
