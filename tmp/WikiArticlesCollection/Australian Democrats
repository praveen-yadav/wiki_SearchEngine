Though never achieving a seat in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the party had considerable influence in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] for the following 30 years. Its representation in the [[Parliament of Australia]] ended on 30 June 2008, after loss of its four remaining Senate seats at the [[Australian federal election, 2007#Senate results|2007 general election]]. Efforts to restore the party's parliamentary effectiveness have not been successful and, {{As of|2013|8|lc=y}}, control was the subject of a lengthy dispute by two factions reportedly associated with two former parliamentarians.<ref name=Crikey>{{cite web |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2012/10/19/bell-tolls-for-the-democrats-bastards-got-the-better-of-them/ |title=Bell tolls for the Democrats: bastards got the better of them? |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>

The original party was founded on principles of honesty, tolerance, compassion and [[direct democracy]] through postal ballots of all members, so that "there should be no [[hierarchical]] structure ... by which a carefully engineered elite could make decisions for the members."<ref name=thirdman>Chipp D and Larkin J ''The Third Man'' Rigby, Melbourne (1978) ISBN 0-7270-0827-7</ref>{{rp|p187}} From the outset, members' participation was fiercely protected in national and divisional constitutions prescribing internal elections, regular meeting protocols, annual conferences—and monthly journals for open discussion and balloting. Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.

Policies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.

The Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the ''cause célèbre'' of the [[Franklin Dam#Inquiry, referendum and election|Franklin River Dam]].

The party's centrist role makes it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left.<ref group="n">Such as the then [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Socialist Workers' Party]] and early green-left parties such as the [[United Tasmania Group]].</ref> This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming "the electoral objective" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.<ref group="n">The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader [[Janet Powell]] in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993 decision of the party's national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members' ''National Journal'' and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material.</ref>

Over three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in all six states. However, at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004]] and [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007]] federal elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost<ref name="results.aec.gov.au">{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm |title=2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100505143042/http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and the sole remaining State parliamentarian, [[David Winderlich]], left the party and was defeated as an independent in [[South Australian state election, 2010#Upper house|2010]].

==History==

===1977–79===
[[File:DonChipp-1977.jpg|right|thumb|[[Don Chipp]], Democrats leader 1977–1986]]
On the evening of 29 April 1977, Don Chipp addressed an overflowing Perth Town Hall meeting which unanimously passed a resolution to form a Centre-Line Party, which Chipp was invited to lead<ref name=thirdman/>{{rp|p185}}—but he firmly declined to reverse his avowed decision to quit politics, having resigned from the Liberal Party and been offered a lucrative position as a radio public affairs commentator. The '''Centre-Line Party''' was the provisional title of the Australian Democrats party.<ref name=thirdman/>{{rp|p 185}}  The occasion was a meeting at the [[Perth Town Hall]] to which [[Don Chipp]] had been invited in the hope that he would accept the position of leader of the new party, which would be an amalgamation of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New LM|New Liberal Movement]]. On that occasion, Chipp declined to commit himself but did so at a corresponding public meeting in Melbourne on 9 May 1977. Chipp received a standing ovation from over 3,000 people, including former Prime Minister [[John Gorton]], and decided to commit himself to leading the new party which was already being constructed by a national steering committee.<ref name=thirdman/>{{rp|p186}} The new party was eventually renamed the Australian Democrats by a ballot of its membership. "Fifty-six suggestions produced by members were listed on the ballot paper, including Uniting Australia Party, Australian Centre Line Party, Dinkum Democrats, Practical Idealists of Australia and People for Sanity Party!! After the ballot, the suggestion of the Steering Committee, 'Australian Democrats', was overwhelmingly accepted."<ref name=thirdman/>{{rp|p188}} The name "Australian Democrats" was already in informal currency before this decision.<ref>Hewat T & Wilson D ''Don Chipp'' (1978) p. 84: "[In mid-June 1977] the party ... was still without a formal name but operating as the Australian Democrats."</ref>

The first Australian Democrats (AD) federal parliamentarian was Senator [[Janine Haines]] who filled [[Steele Hall|Steele Hall's]] casual Senate vacancy for South Australia in 1977. Surprisingly, she was not a candidate when the party contested the [[Australian federal election, 1977|1977 federal elections]] after Don Chipp had agreed to be leader and figurehead. Members and candidates were not lacking in electoral experience, since the Australia Party had been contesting all federal elections since [[Australian federal election, 1969|1969]] and the [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]], in [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974]] and [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975]]. The party's broad aim was to achieve a [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in one or more parliaments and to exercise it responsibly in line with policies determined by membership.

The grassroot support attracted by Chipp's leadership was measurable at the party's first electoral test at the [[Australian federal election, 1977|1977 federal election]] on 10 December, when 9.38 per cent of the total Lower House vote was polled and 11.13 per cent of the Senate vote. At that time, with five Senate seats being contested in each state, the required [[Droop quota|quota]] was a daunting 16.66 per cent. However, the first 6-year-term seats were won by Don Chipp (Vic) and [[Colin Mason]] (NSW).

===1980–82===
The Australian Democrats' first national conference, on 16–17 February 1980, was opened by the distinguished nuclear physicist and former governor of South Australia, Sir [[Mark Oliphant]], who said: <blockquote>''I was privileged to be in the chair at the public meeting in Melbourne when [Don Chipp] announced formation of a new party, dedicated to preserve what freedoms we still retain, and to increase them. A party in which dictatorship from the top was replaced by consensus. A party not ordered about by big business and the rich, or by union bosses. A party where a man could retain freedom of conscience and not thereby be faced with expulsion. A party to which the intelligent individual could belong without having to subscribe to a dogmatic creed. In other words, a democratic party.<ref>1980 Conference Proceedings, ''Beyond our Expectations''</ref>'' </blockquote>

At a Melbourne media conference on 19 September 1980, in the midst of the [[Australian federal election, 1980|1980 election campaign]], Chipp described his party's aim as to "keep the bastards honest"—the "bastards" being the major parties and/or politicians in general. This became a long-lived slogan for the Democrats.<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/rp/2008-09/09rp25.pdf Cathy Madden, Research Paper, "Australian Democrats: the passing of an era", p. 2 and note 6, 27 March 2009]; Retrieved 1 September 2013</ref>

At the October 1980 election, the Democrats polled 9.25 per cent of the Senate vote, electing [[Janine Haines]] (SA) and two new senators [[Michael Macklin]] (Qld) and [[John Siddons]] (Vic), bringing the party's strength to five Senate seats from 1 July 1981 .

A South Australian by-election in the state seat of [[Electoral district of Mitcham (South Australia)|Mitcham]] (now [[Electoral district of Waite|Waite]]) in 1982 saw [[Heather Southcott]] retain the seat for the Democrats from [[Robin Millhouse]] since 1955 (Democrat since 1977), however it was lost later that year at the [[South Australian state election, 1982|1982 state election]]. Mitcham was the only single-member lower house seat anywhere in Australia to be won by the Democrats.

===1987–90===

It had been expected that the Democrats would find it difficult to win seats at the next Senate election due in 1987. However, their task was assisted by the calling of a [[double dissolution]] election by Prime Minister, [[Bob Hawke]]. This reduced the quota necessary to win a seat to 7.7%. In NSW (Paul McLean), Victoria (Janet Powell) and South Australia (Janine Haines), 6 year terms were won. In South Australia, a second senator (John Coulter) was elected to 3 year term, and short terms were also won Michael Macklin in Queensland and Jean Jenkins in Western Australia.

===1990–91===
<!--Pic of Janine Haines lifted because it lacks orig creator's permission-->
:''See [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ApT9ZZs5vM 'Give a Damn: Vote Democrat 1'] campaign commercial''
1990 saw the voluntary departure from the Senate of [[Janine Haines]] (a step with which not all Democrats agreed) and the narrow failure of her strategic goal of winning the House of Representatives seat known as the [[Division of Kingston]].

Her casual vacancy was filled by [[Meg Lees]] several months before the arrival of [[Cheryl Kernot]], elected to replace the retiring deputy leader [[Michael Macklin]]. The ambitious Kernot immediately contested the Senate leadership. Being unemployed at the time, she requested and obtained party funds to pay for her travel to address members in all seven divisions.<ref>AD ''National Journal'' June 1990, p.5</ref> In the event, Victorian [[Janet Powell]] was elected as leader and [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]] was chosen as deputy leader.

Despite the loss of Haines and the WA Senate seat (through an inconsistent national preference agreement with the ALP), the 1990 federal election heralded something of a rebirth for the party, with a dramatic rise in primary vote. This was at the same time as an economic [[recession]] was building, and events such as the [[Gulf War]] in Kuwait were beginning to shepherd issues of globalisation and transnational trade on to national government agendas.

Virtually alone on the Australian political landscape, Janet Powell consistently attacked both the government and opposition which had closed ranks in support of the Gulf War. Whereas the House of Representatives was thus able to avoid any debate about the war and Australia's participation,<ref group="n">The sole independent member in the House, [[Ted Mack (politician)|Ted Mack]], was unable to launch his critical motion for lack of a seconder.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Iraq%20%20Dataset%3Ahansardr,hansards,hansardr80,hansards80%20%28%28SpeakerId%3AAT4%29%29%20Date%3A01%2F08%2F1990%20%3E%3E%2001%2F04%2F1992;rec=0;resCount=Default |title=Ted Mack's speech on Gulf War |publisher=Parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> the Democrats took full advantage of the opportunity to move for a debate in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?ID=393706&TABLE=HANSARDS |title=Senate Hansard, 21&nbsp;Jan 1991 |publisher=Parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

Possibly because of the party's opposition to the Gulf War, there was mass-media antipathy and negative publicity which some construed as poor media performance by Janet Powell, the party's standing having stalled at about 10%. Before 12 months of her leadership had passed, the South Australian and Queensland divisions were circulating the party's first-ever petition to criticise and oust the parliamentary leader. The explicit grounds related to Powell's alleged responsibility for poor AD ratings in Gallup and other media surveys of potential voting support. When this charge was deemed insufficient, interested party officers and senators reinforced it with negative [[News leak|media 'leaks']] concerning her openly established relationship with [[Sid Spindler]] and exposure of administrative failings resulting in excessive overtime to a staff member. With National Executive blessing, the party room pre-empted the ballot by replacing the leader with deputy [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]]. In the process, severe internal divisions were generated. One major collateral casualty was the party whip [[Paul McLean (Australian politician)|Paul McLean]] who resigned and quit the Senate in disgust at what he perceived as in-fighting between close friends. The casual NSW vacancy created by his resignation was filled by [[Karin Sowada]]. Powell duly left the party, along with many leading figures of the Victorian branch of the party, and unsuccessfully stood as an Independent candidate when her term expired. In later years, she campaigned for the Australian Greens.

==Policy==
The party's original support base consisted of voters alienated by perceived unproductive adversarial conflict between the two mainstream parties and an emerging new constituency of people with a desire to participate more effectively in government and to promote concerns for [[environmental protection]] and [[social justice]]. The party aimed to combine liberal social policies with centrist, particularly [[neo-Keynesian economics]] and a progressive environmental platform.

The original agenda included [[economic interventionism|interventionist economic]] policies, commitment to [[environmentalism|environmental]] causes, support for [[wiktionary:reconciliation|reconciliation]] with Australia's [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous population]] through such mechanisms as formal treaties, [[pacifism|pacifist]] approaches to international relations, open government, constitutional reform, progressive approaches to social issues such as sexuality and drugs, and strong support for [[human rights]] and civil liberties. Its membership largely comprised [[tertiary education|tertiary-educated]] and [[middle class|middle-class]] constituents. The party also appealed to voters opposed to untrammeled government power and wishing to have alternative views aired in parliaments and media.

The party has a platform of [[participatory democracy]], with policies supporting [[proportional representation]] and [[citizen initiated referendum|citizen-initiated referenda]]. Many important internal issues (such as electoral preselection and leadership) are decided by direct postal ballot of the membership. Although policies are theoretically set in a similar fashion, Australian Democrats parliamentarians generally had extensive freedom in interpreting them.

However, by 1980, the Australian Democrats had employed the postal-ballot method at both national at state levels to develop an extensive body of written policy covering not only the political agendas of the day but also innovative and far-sighted policies for environmental and economic sustainability, water and energy conservation, e.g., through development of alternative energy sources, expanded public transport, etc. To the community's growing concerns about human rights, the Australian Democrats added finely detailed policies on animal welfare and species preservation. The material is available in election manifestos and copies of the party's journals, obtainable in major public libraries.

In a 2009 "rebuild" process, the party announced creation of a new policy process, attempts to improve internal communication, and envisaged development of a new party constitution.<ref>{{cite web|first=Clinton |last=Barnes |url=http://www.australian-democrats.org.au/journal/Journal200908.pdf |title=Activities of our rebuilding |publisher=Democrats National Journal |date=August 2009|page=3|accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref>

Prior to the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], the party, though factionally divided into two separate organisations,<ref name=starr>[http://www.australian-democrats.org.au/journal/Journal201307.pdf Statement of Andrew Starr] ''Australian Democrats National Journal'', p. 2, July 2013.

==Electoral fortunes==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2007}}
The Australian Democrats' electoral fortunes have fluctuated throughout their history.

During the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating|Keating]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Governments (1983–96), the Australian Democrats held a theoretical balance of power in the Senate: the numbers were such that they could team with Labor to pass legislation, or team with the Coalition to block legislation on occasions when the Coalition decided to oppose a government bill.

Their power was weakened in 1996 after the [[Howard Government]] was elected, and a Labor senator, [[Mal Colston]], resigned from the Labor party. This meant that the Australian Democrats now shared the parliamentary balance of power with two Independent senators. As a result, the Coalition government could often bypass the Australian Democrats, and pass legislation by negotiating with Colston and [[Brian Harradine]]. Following [[Australian federal election, 1998|the 1998 election]] the Australian Democrats again held the balance of power, until the Coalition gained a Senate majority at [[Australian federal election, 2004|the 2004 election]].

The Hawke and Keating governments pursued economic policies that drew on [[economic rationalism|economic rationalist]] and [[neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] thought, and the Australian Democrats positioned themselves to the left of the ALP government, and thus at the left end of mainstream Australian politics. Their appeal (and focus on issues beyond the usual "economic" ones that monopolised major party attention) was always greatest amongst tertiary-educated voters. However, the party's progressive politics also remained attractive to a sizeable section of mainly middle class ("wet") [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] supporters – often female, and often disparagingly described on the right of the Liberal Party as "Soccer Mums"  or "Doctor's Wives" – who were turned off by the Liberal party's social conservatism and "Reagonomic/Thatcherite" economic policies. Many Liberals saw their support of the Australian Democrats in the Senate as having "an each way bet", ameliorating the effect of their support for the Liberals in the House of Representatives – an attitude positively fostered, not unsurprisingly, by Democrat politicians and campaigners.

Cheryl Kernot became leader in 1993. She had strong media appeal, which increased media and public awareness of herself and the party. She was known to have interests in industrial relations and was able to cultivate solid relationships with Labor government frontbenchers, which also added to her credibility in the press gallery.

Lack of clear direction other than, possibly, senators' common ambition to play a more productive role in government manifested itself in tensions over Cheryl Kernot's policy on [[industrial relations]] (see the [[Workplace Relations Act 1996]]). Under Kernot, after negotiations and some compromises from the government, the Australian Democrats voted for the Howard Government's right-leaning industrial relations legislation which decreased union power and allowed a larger role for individual employer-employee contracts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Kernot, however, remained broadly opposed to the Liberal government. This, together with her personal ambition for a role and contribution to strategy in government,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/parties/democrats/97-10-15kernot-resigns.shtml|title=Cheryl Kernot's Resignation Speech|publisher=AustralianPolitics.com |date=15 October 1997|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> led her to defect to the ALP in 1997. Her replacement as leader was by long-serving deputy, [[Meg Lees]].

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lees.jpg|thumb|right|[[Meg Lees]]]] -->
Under Lees' leadership, in the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 federal election]], the Democrats' candidate [[John Schumann]] came within 2 per cent of taking Liberal Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]]'s seat of [[Division of Mayo|Mayo]] in the Adelaide Hills under Australia's [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system.  The party's Senate representation increased to nine Senators.

Internal conflict and leadership tensions from 2000 to 2002, blamed on the party's support for the Government's [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), was damaging to the Democrats.

Opposed by the Labor Party, the [[Australian Greens]] and independent Senator [[Brian Harradine]], the GST required Democrat support to pass. In an election fought on tax, the Democrats publicly stated that they liked neither the Liberal (GST) tax package or the Labor package, but pledged to work with whichever party was elected to make their tax package better. They campaigned with the slogan "No GST on food".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;db=;group=;holdingType=;id=;orderBy=alphaAss;page=;query=%28Dataset%3Apartypol,lcatalog,jrnart,jrnart88%20SearchCategory_Phrase%3A%22library%22%29%20Speech_Phrase%3A%22yes%22%20Dataset_Phrase%3A%22partypol%22;querytype=;rec=3;resCount= |title=Australian Democrats Campaign Launch Speech 1998 |publisher=Parlinfo.aph.gov.au |date=20 September 1998 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=August 2013}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/elections/1998/news3.shtml|title=Democrats Support GST, Want Food Exempt |publisher=AustralianPolitics.com |date=19 September 1998 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref>

In 1999, after negotiations with Prime Minister [[John Howard|Howard]], [[Meg Lees]], [[Andrew Murray (politician)|Andrew Murray]] and the party room Senators agreed to support the A New Tax System (ANTS) legislation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov.au/contentitem.asp?ContentID=167&NavID= |title=Australian Treasury: Tax Reform: Not a New Tax, A New Tax System |publisher=Treasury.gov.au |date=1 August 1998 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref> with exemptions from GST for most food and some medicines, as well as many environmental and social concessions.<ref>Australian Democrats: [http://www.democrats.org.au/docs/2004/TAXATION_GST.pdf The GST and the New Tax System] Election 2004 Issue Sheet</ref><ref>Senator Meg Lees's address to the Australian Democrats' National Conference, Brisbane, 20 January 2001 [http://australianpolitics.com/parties/democrats/01-01-20lees-speech.pdf]</ref> Five Australian Democrats senators voted in favour.<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|first=Alexandra|last= Kirk|title=Democrats make good on GST compromise deal|date=19 June 1999|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s31775.htm|work=ABC PM, Radio National}}</ref> However, two dissident senators on the party's left [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] and [[Andrew Bartlett]] voted against the GST.<ref>ABC TV: 7.30 Report: 7/6/1999: ["GST deal sparks Democrat crisis" http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s28235.htm]</ref><ref>John Kehoe "Lees has no regrets Democrats gave their support" ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' 30 June 2010.</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:leaders2001-small.gif|thumb|right|[[Aden Ridgeway]] and [[Natasha Stott Despoja]].]] -->
In 2001, a leadership spill saw [[Meg Lees]] replaced as leader<ref>Phillip Coorey "Democrats in Denial" in David Solomon (ed) "Howard's Race – Winning the Unwinnable Election, Harper Collins, 2002, p42-44</ref> by [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] after a very public and bitter leadership battle.<ref>Alison Rogers, "The Natasha Factor," Lothian Books, 2004, pp29ff</ref> Despite criticism of Stott Despoja's youth and lack of experience, the 2001 election saw the Democrats receive similar media coverage to the previous election.<ref>Phillip Coorey "Democrats Opt for Leadership" in David Solomon (ed) "Howard's Race – Winning the Unwinnable Election, Harper Collins, 2002, p180</ref> Despite the internal divisions, the Australian Democrats' election result in 2001 was quite good. However, it was not enough to prevent the loss of [[Vicki Bourne]]'s Senate seat in NSW.

Resulting tensions between Stott Despoja and Lees led to [[Meg Lees]] leaving the party in 2002, becoming an independent and forming the [[Australian Progressive Alliance]].  Stott Despoja stood down from the leadership following a loss of confidence by her party room colleagues.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s655339.htm Stott Despoja resigns as Democrats leader], ABC 7.30 Report, 21 October 2002</ref> It led to a protracted leadership battle in 2002, which eventually led to the election of Senator Andrew Bartlett as leader.

On 6 December 2003, Andrew Bartlett stepped aside temporarily as leader of the party, after an incident in which he assaulted [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Senator [[Jeannie Ferris]] on the floor of [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] while intoxicated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/06/1070625583872.html |title=Disgraced leader steps aside |work=The Age |location=Australia |date= 7 December 2003 |accessdate=3 April 2007 |location=Melbourne}}</ref> The party issued a statement stating that Deputy Leader [[Lyn Allison]] would serve as the Acting Leader of the party. Bartlett apologised to the Democrats, Jeannie Ferris and the Australian public for his behaviour and assured all concerned that it would never happen again. On 29 January 2004, after seeking medical treatment, Bartlett returned to the Australian Democrats leadership, vowing to abstain from alcohol.

===2004===
<!-- Remove missing image [[File:Allison.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lyn Allison]]]] -->
Support for the Australian Democrats fell significantly at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] in which they achieved only 2.4 per cent of the national vote. Nowhere was this more noticeable than in their key support base of suburban [[Adelaide]] in South Australia, where they received between 7 and 31 per cent of the Lower House vote in 2001, and between 1 and 4 per cent in 2004. Three incumbent senators were defeated—[[Aden Ridgeway]] (NSW), [[Brian Greig]] (WA) and [[John Cherry (Australian politician)|John Cherry]] (Qld). Following the loss, the customary post-election leadership ballot installed Lyn Allison as leader and Andrew Bartlett as her deputy.

From 1 July 2005 the Australian Democrats lost official parliamentary party status, being represented by only four senators while the governing Liberal-National Coalition gained a majority and potential control of the Senate—the first time this advantage had been enjoyed by any government since 1980.

===2006===

On 5 January 2006, the ABC reported that the [[Tasmanian Electoral Commission]] had de-registered that division of the party for failing to provide a list containing the required number of members to be registered for Tasmanian state and local elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/items/200601/1542299.htm?tasmania |title=Australian Democrats Deregistered in Tasmania |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=5 January 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>

On 18 March 2006, at the [[South Australian legislative election, 2006|2006 South Australian state election]], the Australian Democrats were reduced to 1.7 per cent of the Legislative Council (upper house) vote. Their sole councillor up for re-election, [[Kate Reynolds]], was defeated.

After the election, South Australian senator [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] denied rumours that she was considering quitting the party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1598147.htm |title=Stott-Despoja denies rumours she is quitting |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=22 March 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

In early July, Richard Pascoe, national and [[South Australian]] party president, resigned, citing slumping opinion polls and the poor result in the 2006 South Australian election as well as South Australian parliamentary leader [[Sandra Kanck]]'s comments regarding the drug [[MDMA]] which he saw as damaging to the party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1683245.htm |title=Political analyst predicts Democrats' demise|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1683993.htm |title=Former leader sees Democrats in 'tatters' |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.theadvertiser.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5936,19698296%255E910,00.html Kanck says rave party safer than the front bar, ''The Advertiser'' 5 July 2006] Article no longer available online.</ref>

On 5 July 2006, Australian Democrats senator for Western Australia [[Andrew Murray (politician)|Andrew Murray]] announced his intention not to contest the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], citing frustration arising from the Howard Government's control of both houses and his unwillingness to serve another six-year term.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/no-life-in-dons-party/2006/07/07/1152240493865.html |author=Phillip Coorey |title=No life in Don's party|work=Sydney Morning Herald  |date= 8 July 2006|accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> His term ended on 30 June 2008.

On 28 August 2006, the founder of the Australian Democrats, [[Don Chipp]], died. Former prime minister Bob Hawke said: "... there is a coincidental timing almost between the passing of Don Chipp and what I think is the death throes of the Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200608/s1727334.htm |title=Hawke predicts end is near for Democrats |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> "

On 22 October 2006, Australian Democrats Senator [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] announced her intention not to seek re-election at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] due to health concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1770646.htm |title=Stott-Despoja to bow out of politics |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=22 October 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> Her term ended on 30 June 2008.

In November 2006, the Australian Democrats fared very poorly in the Victorian state election, receiving a Legislative Council vote tally of only 0.83%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/state2006resultbypartyUH.html |title=Victorian Electoral Commission: Results for Upper House, 2006 |publisher=Vec.vic.gov.au |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100416165522/http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/State2006resultbypartyUH.html| archivedate= 16 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> less than half of the party's result in 2002 (1.79 per cent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/state2002resultbypartyprovince.html |title=Victorian Electoral Commission: Results for Upper House, 2006 |publisher=Vec.vic.gov.au |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100405222227/http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/State2002resultbypartyprovince.html| archivedate= 5 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===2007===
In the New South Wales state election of March 2007, the Australian Democrats lost their last remaining NSW Upper House representative, [[Arthur Chesterfield-Evans]]. The party fared poorly, gaining only 1.8 per cent of the Legislative Council vote. A higher vote was achieved in some of the Legislative Assembly seats selectively contested as compared to 2003. However, the statewide vote share fell because the party was unable to field as many candidates as in 2003.

In the Victorian state by-election in Albert Park District<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/stateby2007resultAlbertParkDistrict.html |title=VEC: Albert Park District By-Election 2007 |publisher=Vec.vic.gov.au |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=25 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> the Australian Democrats stood candidate Paul Kavanagh, who polled a respectable 5.75 per cent of the primary vote, despite a large number of candidates, and all media attention focusing on the battle between Labor and Greens candidates.

On 13 September 2007, the ACT Democrats (Australian Capital Territory Division of the party) was deregistered<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/ni/2007-279/default.asp |title=ACT legislation register – Electoral (Cancellation of the Registration of the Australian Democrats) Notice 2007 – main page |publisher=Legislation.act.gov.au |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> by the ACT Electoral Commissioner, being unable to demonstrate a minimum membership of 100 electors.

The Democrats had no success at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]]. Two incumbent senators, Lyn Allison (Victoria) and Andrew Bartlett (Queensland), were defeated, their seats both reverting to major parties. Their two remaining colleagues, Andrew Murray (WA) and Natasha Stott Despoja (SA), did not run for new terms. All four senators' terms expired on 30 June 2008—leaving the Australian Democrats with no federal representation for the first time since its founding in 1977. An ABC report noted that "on the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) website the party is now referred to just as 'other'".<ref>Caldwell A ''[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/26/2101885.htm?site=elections/federal/2007 Democrats to lose parliamentary representation]'' 26 November 2007</ref>

===Post-2007===
Since losing Senate representation, the Australian Democrats have continued to contest state and federal elections without any success. The last of the party's state upper-house members, [[David Winderlich]], resigned from the party in October 2009<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,26177316-2682,00.html?from=public_rss |title=David Winderlich quits, Democrats are no more |publisher=News.com.au |date=7 October 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2010 | first1=Russell | last1=Emmerson}}</ref> and was defeated as an independent at the [[Full results of the South Australian state election, 2010|2010 election]].

In March 2012, the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] queried a Democrats submission of 550 names of purported members and proposed deregistering the party for having fewer than 500 members, the threshold needed for registration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electoral Commission threatens Democrats with deregistration  |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/electoral-commission-threatens-democrats-with-deregistration/story-e6frea8c-1226291165640|date=7 March 2012|accessdate=7 March 2012|author=Hockley, Catherine |work=Adelaide Advertiser|publisher=News Ltd}}</ref> The Commission later satisfied itself that the party had sufficient membership to continue its registration.

In July 2012, former WA senator [[Brian Greig]] was elected national president "to resurrect the Australian Democrats as they attempt to take advantage of present political unrest".<ref name=trenwith>Trenwith, Courtney [http://www.smh.com.au/national/democrats-comeback-inspired-by-inflexible-greens-20120720-22f4q.html Democrats' comeback inspired by 'inflexible' Greens] [[Sydney Morning Herald]], 21 July 2012</ref> However, he left the position two months later, and the party's national secretary reported "severe friction" within the party.<ref>[http://www.democrats.org.au/news/NatJournalOctober2012.pdf Statement by Roger Howe, nominating for election as National President] ''Australian Democrats National Journal'', October 2012, p.2, at official website</ref>

In December 2012, former South Australian MLC [[Sandra Kanck]] was reportedly expelled from the party for attempting to close and/or merge the Australian Democrats with population abatement groups that she is affiliated with.<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/116331170/Untitled]</ref>

==Support==
Support for the Democrats historically tended to fluctuate between about 5 and 10 per cent of the population and was geographically concentrated around the wealthy dense [[Central Business District|CBD and inner-suburban neighbourhoods]] of the [[Australian capital cities|capital cities]] (especially [[Adelaide, Australia|Adelaide]]). Therefore, they never managed to win a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] seat. During the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s they typically held one or two [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in each state, as well as having some representatives in state parliaments.<ref>Ainsley Symons (2012), "The Democrats and Local Government. Were they ever a threat to the ALP?" in ''Recorder (Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, Melbourne Branch)'' No. 274, Page 7.</ref>

Following the internal conflict over [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] (1998–2001) and resultant leadership changes, a dramatic decline occurred in the Democrats' membership and voting support in all states. Simultaneously, an increase was recorded in support for the [[Australian Greens]] who, by 2004, were supplanting the Democrats as a substantial [[third party (politics)|third party]]. The trend was noted that year by political scientists Dean Jaensch et al.<ref>"the Australian Democrats appear to be in decline, having performed very poorly at the 2004 federal election and look to be replaced by the Greens as the major 'minor' party". --Jaensch D et al. ''[http://democratic.audit.anu.edu.au/papers/focussed_audits/200501_jaensch_parties.pdf Australian Political Parties in the Spotlight]'' pp 40–41. Australian National University, January 2005</ref> Elsewhere, Jaensch later suggested it was possible the Democrats could make a political comeback in the federal arena.<ref>Dean Jaensch radio interview, [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2631202.htm Last remaining Democrat MP could become independent], at [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation#Radio|ABC PM]], 20 July 2009. Retrieved 12 August 2009</ref>

Following [[Tony Abbott]]'s displacement of [[Malcolm Turnbull]] as federal leader of the Liberal Party in 2009, the Democrats sought to attract the support of "those Liberals who no longer feel they can support their party".<ref>[http://www.democrats.org.au/news/index.htm?press_id=6655&display=1 Media advice: New content on the Australian Democrats website] 12 December 2009, on official party website</ref>{{dead link|date=August 2013}}

==Federal parliamentary leaders==
