'''Charles William "Bill" Mumy, Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|uː|m|i}}; born February 1, 1954), is an American actor, musician, pitchman, instrumentalist, [[voice-over artist]], and a figure in the science-fiction community. He is perhaps best known for his work as a [[child actor]] in film and television throughout the 1960s, then credited as '''Billy Mumy'''.

The red-headed Mumy came to prominence in the 1960s as a child actor, most notably as Will Robinson, the youngest of the three children of Professor John and Dr. Maureen Robinson (played by [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]] and [[June Lockhart]], respectively) and friend of the nefarious and pompous Dr. Zachary Smith (played by [[Jonathan Harris]]), in the 1960s [[CBS]] sci-fi television series ''[[Lost in Space]]''.

He later appeared as a lonely teenager, [[Sterling North]], in the 1969 Disney film, ''[[Rascal (film)|Rascal]]'', with [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]]. He was cast as Teft in the 1971 film ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children (film)|Bless the Beasts and Children]]''. In the 1990s, he had the role of [[Lennier]] in the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] sci-fi TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', and he also served as narrator of [[A&E Network]]'s [[Emmy Award]]-winning series, ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''. He is notable for his musical career, as a solo artist and as half of the duo [[Barnes & Barnes]].

==Early life and career==
Mumy was born in [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]], the son of the former Muriel Gertrude Gould and Charles William Mumy, Sr., a cattle rancher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/10/Bill-Mumy.html |title=Bill Mumy Biography (1954–)}}</ref> He began his professional career at the age of six, and has worked on more than four hundred television episodes, eighteen motion pictures, various commercials, and scores of voice over work, as well as working as a musician, songwriter, recording artist and writer.

==Television career==

Among Mumy's earliest television roles was as 6-year-old Willy in the 1960 episode "Donald's Friend" of the [[NBC]] family drama [[television series]], ''[[National Velvet (TV series)|National Velvet]]'', starring [[Lori Martin]] as an aspiring thoroughbred rider.

Mumy is remembered as a player in [[CBS]]'s [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|original ''Twilight Zone'']] (1959 to 1964). In the episode "[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]" (November 1961), he plays a child who terrorizes his town with [[psychic]] powers (a role he later reprised along with his daughter [[Liliana Mumy]], in the ''[[It's Still a Good Life]]'' episode of [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|the second revival series]]; he also had a cameo in the remake of "It's a Good Life" in the 3rd segment of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''). Mumy also played the character of young Pip, a boy who enjoyed playing with his father but was always ignored, in the episode "[[In Praise of Pip]]" (September 1963), and the character of Billy Bayles, a boy who talks to his dead grandmother through a toy telephone, in the episode "[[Long Distance Call]]" (March 1961).  He also wrote the story for the episode ''[[Found and Lost]]'' in the second revival of ''The Twilight Zone''.

In 1961, Billy was cast on CBS's ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television series in "The Door Without a Key." The same episode features [[John Larch]], the actor who played his father on the ''Twilight Zone'''s episode of "It's a Good Life."  The same year, he starred as little Jackie in the episode ''Bang! You're Dead'', which also featured actress [[Marta Kristen]], who played his sister Judy on ''Lost in Space''.

Mumy was cast as Mark Murdock in the 1962 episode "Keep an Eye on Santa Claus" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]  drama series, ''[[Going My Way (TV series)|Going My Way]]'', starring [[Gene Kelly]] as a [[Roman Catholic]] priest in [[New York City]] and loosely based on the 1944 [[Bing Crosby]] [[Going My Way|film]] of the same name. His fellow guest stars in the segment were [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]], and [[Frank McHugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0937698/|title="Keep an Eye on Santa Claus", ''Going My Way'', December 12, 1962|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref>

In 1963, at the age of eight, young Mumy appeared in [[Jack Palance]]'s ABC [[circus]] drama ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', loosely based on a former [[Charlton Heston]] film. He was further cast in 1963 as Miles, a parentless boy, in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode, "The Case of the Shifty Shoebox." He portrayed Freddy in the 1963 episode, "End of an Image," on the NBC modern western series, ''[[Empire (1962 TV series)|Empire]]'', starring [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] as rancher Jim Redigo.

In 1964, he was cast as [[Richard Kimble]]'s nephew in ABC's ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' in the 15th episode entitled "Home Is The Hunted"; as Barry in the [[NBC]] medical drama ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', episode "Sunday Father"; as himself three times in the ABC sitcom ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''; in the [[Walt Disney|Disney]] film ''For the Love of Willadena''; and as a troubled orphan taken home with Darrin and Samantha Stephens in ABC's fantasy sitcom, ''[[Bewitched]]'' episode "[[List of Bewitched episodes#Season 1 (1964–1965)|A Vision of Sugarplums]]" (December 1964).

Mumy was reportedly the first choice to portray the role of [[Eddie Munster]] in the 1964 CBS situation comedy ''[[The Munsters]]'', but his parents objected because of the extensive make-up. The role instead went to [[Butch Patrick]].  Mumy did appear in one episode as a friend of Eddie's. In 1965, he guest starred on an episode of NBC's ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' "Whatever Became Of Baby Custer?" as a neighborhood kid, who witnesses Jeannie's magic.

[[File:Lost in Space Billy Mumy 1965.jpg|thumb|right|Mumy as Will Robinson, 1965]]
In 1973, he played a musician friend of [[Cliff DeYoung]] in the TV movie ''[[Sunshine (1973 film)|Sunshine]]'', and later reprised the role in ''[[Sunshine Christmas]]'' and in the TV series ''[[Sunshine (U.S. TV series)|Sunshine]]''.

In 1974, he played Nick Butler in the pilot episode of NBC's ''[[The Rockford Files]]''.

He is perhaps best known for his role as [[Lost in Space#Characters|Will Robinson]] on the CBS science fiction television series ''Lost in Space'' (1965–1968), as well as for his role as ambassadorial aide [[Lennier]] in the syndicated series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' (1994–1998). Mumy has garnered praise from the science fiction fandom for his portrayal of these two characters.

In 1996, he was a writer and co-creator of the show ''[[Space Cases]]'', a [[Nickelodeon]] television show with themes similar to ''Lost in Space''.

He played a [[Starfleet]] member in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[The Siege of AR-558 (DS9 episode)|The Siege of AR-558]]" (November 1998). To his delight (since, as [[Lennier]], he always appeared onscreen in prosthetic makeup), he played a human character who assists [[Ezri Dax]] in turning cloaked [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] mines against an army of [[Jem'Hadar]].

Recent acting performances can be seen in a 2006 episode of ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'' and the [[Sci Fi]] original film ''[[A.I. Assault]]''.

==Voice-over career==
Mumy has narrated over 50 episodes of the [[A&E Network|Arts & Entertainment Channel]]'s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' series, as well as hosting and narrating several other documentaries and specials for A & E, [[Animal Planet]] network, [[Syfy|The Sci Fi Channel]], and [[E!]]. His voice over acting talents can be heard on animated shows like ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]'', ''[[Scooby Doo]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''Little Wizard Adventures'', ''[[The Oz Kids]]'' and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' and [[Doc McStuffins]]. He also voices dozens of national commercials, such as [[Farmers Insurance Group|Farmers Insurance]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Bud Ice]], [[Blockbuster (movie rental store)|Blockbuster]], [[Twix]], [[Oscar Mayer]], and [[McDonald's]].

Additionally, Mumy produces and hosts 'The Real Good Radio Hour', a weekly series on KSAV Radio that focuses on various styles of music and the artists that pioneered them.<ref>http://www.ksav.org/index.php/programs/realgoodradiohour</ref>

== Friendship with Jonathan Harris ==
At age 11, in 1965, Mumy began working with Jonathan Harris on ''Lost in Space'', and the two became close friends, both on and off set. He would also spend time with Harris' family, while not working on "Space" or taking a hiatus from the show. In 1996, it was mentioned that Mumy was also reunited with Harris, again, at a [[Walt Disney]] convention in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]]. Mumy worked again with Harris on the 1998 retrospective special ''Lost In Space: Forever'', where they reprised their roles in a scene written by Mumy (with Harris re-writing his lines). This was done one year after the rest of the cast (including both Mumy & Harris) appeared inside ''[[TV Guide]]'' and said that the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] had planned to do a ''Lost in Space'' marathon while promoting a new movie. Harris was to appear in the planned TV movie, ''Lost in Space: The Journey Home'', but died before production started in 2002 and the production was cancelled. Mumy read the eulogy at Harris' funeral and was asked to narrate his longtime friend's life on [[A&E Biography|A&E ''Biography'']] that same year. According to a 2010 interview on ''Blog Talk Radio'''s, ''Lessons Learned'', Rick Tocquigny, when asked if Mumy was a Jonathan Harris fan, before Mumy's first meeting with Harris on ''Lost in Space'', he said at age 5, he was too young to watch his mentor's show ''[[The Third Man (TV series)|The Third Man]]'' which was probably late at night, but was old enough to watch ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]'' (which also starred Harris's real-life best friend [[Don Adams]]). After that, he watched [[rerun]]s of ''The Third Man'', and he was a Jonathan Harris fan, growing up (when he was actually a fan of Guy Williams', ''[[Zorro (TV series)|Zorro]]'', who played his future TV father – John Robinson).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lifelessonsnetwork/2010/09/22/bill-mumy-of-lost-in-space-fame-shares-his-life-lessons |title=Bill Mumy of Lost in Space fame shares his life lessons 09/22 by Lessons Learned |publisher=Blog Talk Radio |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>

On June 14, 2006, Mumy got to work with Harris one last time, though posthumously. Harris had done voice work for the animated short [[The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas]] narrating the film and playing the part of the "The Bolt". He passed away many years before the films completion. As a tribute to Harris writer director John Wardlaw added a scene to the short film that reunited  Lost in Space cast members Bill Mumy, Marta Kristen and Angela Cartwright as the animated Ratchett family.<ref>http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2011/07/the_bolt_who_screwed_christmas.php</ref>

In May 2013, eleven years after the death of Mumy's acting mentor in November 2002, Mumy commented on his connection between the familiar actor (Harris) and the unfamiliar actor's (Mumy) on- and off-screen connection on ''Lost in Space,'' "Yes we did. Indeed, dear boy. Don’t you forget it." Mumy also added, "Well, yeah. I never really had too many uncomfortable moments working with any actor. I was comfortable working with most everybody. It’s just the more that Jonathan and I did together, the more he changed the character. He really changed the character of Dr. Smith himself. He really turned him from a snarling saboteur villain to this bumbling insulting kook. The more he played it for comedy, the more Irwin Allen liked it. The show really went the way that Jonathan led it. But we had great chemistry together, and we never had a bad day. We were always prepared, as was Bobby May who was inside the robot. When we had our work to do – and I think this is a very big reason the way it went – they’d get us done in a couple of takes. Nobody screwed up. It was easier for the crew and it was easier for us, and people seemed to like it."<ref>http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/billmumy/</ref>

== Personal life ==
Unlike many child actors, Mumy entered the profession at his own insistence, and his parents took pains to make sure he matured properly in his job. His father, who was a cattle rancher, carefully invested his son's income, and thereby avoided problems encountered by other child actors of his period. He currently lives in [[Hollywood Hills]], California, with his wife, Eileen, and their two child-actor children, Seth and [[Liliana Mumy|Liliana]].
