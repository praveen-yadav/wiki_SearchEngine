'''August''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-August.ogg|ˈ|ɔː|g|ə|s|t}} {{respell|AW|gəst}}) is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s and one of seven months with a length of 31 days.<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/42820/August August]."

In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], August is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

In common years no other month starts on the same day of the week as August, though in leap years February starts on the same day. August ends on the same day of the week as November every year. March and November of the previous year starts on the same day of the week as August of the current year as a common year and June of the previous year starts on the same day of the week as August of the current year as a leap year. In years immediately before common years, August starts and ends on the same day of the week as May of the following year while in years immediately before leap years, August starts on the same day of as October of the following year and ends on the same day of the week as February and October of the following year.  

This month was originally named ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month [[Roman calendar]] under [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] in 753 BC, when [[March]] was the first month of the year. About 700&nbsp;BC it became the eighth month when [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the year before March by King [[Numa Pompilius]], who also gave it 29 days. [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]] giving it its modern length of 31 days. In [[8 BC]] it was [[Augustus#Month of August|renamed]] in honor of [[Augustus]] (despite common belief, he did not take a day from February; see the [[Julian_calendar#Sacrobosco.27s_theory_on_month_lengths|debunked theory on month lengths]]). According to a [[Senatus consultum]] quoted by [[Macrobius]], he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:id=calendarium-cn Year of Julius Caesar, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1890), William Smith, LLD, William Wayte, G.
