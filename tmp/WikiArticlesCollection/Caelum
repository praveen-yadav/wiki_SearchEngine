'''Caelum''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|l|əm}} is a faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky, introduced in the 1750s by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]. Its name means "the [[chisel]]" in [[Latin]], and it was formerly known as '''Caelum Scalptorium''', "the engraver's chisel".<ref name="ridpath"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/caelum.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Caelum |last = Ridpath |first = Ian}}</ref> It is the eighth smallest constellation, and [[solid angle|subtends a solid angle]] of around 0.038 [[steradian]]s, just less than that of [[Corona Australis]].

Caelum is a faint constellation, having no star brighter than fourth [[stellar magnitude|magnitude]]. Its brightest star is the magnitude 4.45 [[Alpha Caeli|α Caeli]].   

*'''[[Alpha Caeli|α Cae]]''' is a white-hued [[main sequence star]] of magnitude 4.45, 66 [[light-year]]s from Earth.<ref name="ridpath"/>

*'''[[Beta Caeli|β Cae]]''' is a white star of magnitude 5.0, 90 light-years from Earth.<ref name="ridpath"/>

*'''[[Gamma Caeli|γ Cae]]''' is a [[double star]] with an orange-hued primary of magnitude 4.6 and a secondary of magnitude 8.1. The primary is 185 light-years from Earth. The two components are difficult to resolve with small amateur telescopes because of their difference in [[visual magnitude]] and their close separation.<ref name="ridpath"/>

*'''[[Delta Caeli|δ Cae]]''' is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 5.1, 710 light-years from Earth.<ref name="ridpath"/>

Caelum contains the galaxies NGC 1571, NGC 1679 and IC 2106. Larger telescopes are needed to see several [[New General Catalog|NGC]] objects, all galaxies, but none brighter than magnitude 11.5 or larger than 3 [[arc minute]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/caelum.html |title = Caelum  |publisher = SEDS}}</ref>

==Namesakes==
[[USS Caelum (AK-106)]] was a [[United States Navy]] ship named after the constellation.
