{{Organelle diagram|300px}}

The '''cytosol''' or '''intracellular fluid''' ('''ICF''') or '''cytoplasmic matrix''' is the liquid found inside [[cell (biology)|cells]]. It is separated into compartments by membranes. For example, the [[mitochondrial matrix]] separates the [[mitochondrion]] into compartments.

In the [[eukaryotic cell]], the cytosol is within the [[cell membrane]] and is part of the [[cytoplasm]], which also comprises the mitochondria, [[plastid]]s, and other [[organelle]]s (but not their internal fluids and structures); the [[cell nucleus]] is separate. In [[prokaryotes]], most of the chemical reactions of [[metabolism]] take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the [[periplasmic space]]. In eukaryotes, while many [[metabolic pathway]]s still occur in the cytosol, others are contained within organelles.

The cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water. Although water forms the large majority of the cytosol, its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of [[ion]]s such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] are different in the cytosol than in the [[extracellular fluid]]; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as [[osmoregulation]] and [[cell signaling]]. The cytosol also contains large amounts of [[macromolecule]]s, which can alter how molecules behave, through [[macromolecular crowding]].

Although once thought to be a simple solution of molecules, multiple levels of organization exist in the cytosol. These include [[diffusion|concentration gradient]]s of small molecules such as [[calcium]], large complexes of [[enzyme]]s that act together to carry out [[metabolic pathway]]s, and [[protein complex]]es such as [[proteasome]]s and [[carboxysome]]s that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.

==Definition==

The term cytosol was first introduced in 1965 by H.A. Lardy, and initially referred to the liquid that was produced by breaking  cells apart and pelleting all the insoluble components by [[Ultracentrifuge|ultracentrifugation]].<ref name=Clegg1984/> Such a soluble cell extract is not identical to the soluble part of the cell cytoplasm and is usually called a cytoplasmic fraction.<ref name=Cammack/> The term ''cytosol'' is now used to refer to the liquid phase of the cytoplasm in an intact cell,<ref name=Cammack>{{cite book |author=Cammack, Richard; Teresa Atwood; Attwood, Teresa K.; Campbell, Peter Scott; Parish, Howard I.; Smith, Tony; Vella, Frank; Stirling, John |title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-852917-1 |oclc=225587597}}</ref> this excludes any part of the cytoplasm that is contained within organelles.<ref name=Lodish/> Due to the possibility of confusion between the use of the word "cytosol" to refer to both extracts of cells and the soluble part of the cytoplasm in intact cells, the phrase "aqueous cytoplasm" has been used to describe the liquid contents of the cytoplasm of living cells.<ref name=Clegg1984/>

==Properties and composition==
The proportion of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms the bulk of cell structure in bacteria,<ref name=Hoppert/> in plant cells the main compartment is the large central [[vacuole]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bowsher CG, Tobin AK |title=Compartmentation of metabolism within mitochondria and plastids |journal=J.

===Water===
Most of the cytosol is  [[water]], which makes up about 70% of the total volume of a typical cell.<ref name=Luby-Phelps2000>{{cite journal |author=Luby-Phelps K |title=Cytoarchitecture and physical properties of cytoplasm: volume, viscosity, diffusion, intracellular surface area |journal=Int.

Although water is vital for life, the structure of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly understood, due to the ability of water to form structures such as [[water cluster]]s through [[hydrogen bond]]s.<ref name=Wiggins/>

The classic view of water in cells is that about 5% of this water is strongly bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of [[solvation]], while the majority has the same structure as pure water.<ref name=Clegg1984/> This water of solvation is not active in [[osmosis]] and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fulton AB |title=How crowded is the cytoplasm? |journal=Cell |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=345–7 |year=1982 |month=September |pmid=6754085 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90231-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Garlid KD |title=The state of water in biological systems |journal=Int.

===Ions===
The concentrations of the other [[ion]]s in cytosol are quite different from those in [[extracellular fluid]] and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids than the outside of the cell.

In contrast to extracellular fluid, cytosol has a high concentration of [[potassium]] ions and a low concentration of [[sodium]] ions.<ref name=Lang>{{cite journal |author=Lang F |title=Mechanisms and significance of cell volume regulation |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=26 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=613S–623S |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17921474 |url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17921474}}</ref> This difference in ion concentrations is critical for [[osmoregulation]], since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by [[osmosis]] - since the levels of [[macromolecule]]s inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the [[Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase]], potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative [[membrane potential]]. To balance this [[potential difference]], negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.<ref name=Lang/>

Cells can deal with even larger osmotic changes by accumulating [[osmoprotectant]]s such as [[betaines]] or [[trehalose]] in their cytosol.<ref name=Lang/> Some of these molecules can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and allow an organism to enter a state of suspended animation called [[cryptobiosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sussich F, Skopec C, Brady J, Cesàro A |title=Reversible dehydration of trehalose and anhydrobiosis: from solution state to an exotic crystal? |journal=Carbohydr.

The low concentration of [[calcium]] in the cytosol allows calcium ions to function as a [[second messenger]] in [[calcium signaling]]. Here, a signal such as a [[hormone]] or an [[action potential]] opens calcium channels so that calcium floods into the cytosol.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Berridge MJ |title=Elementary and global aspects of calcium signalling |journal=J.

===Macromolecules===
Protein molecules that do not bind to [[cell membrane]]s or the [[cytoskeleton]] are dissolved in the cytosol. The amount of protein in cells is extremely high, and approaches 200&nbsp;mg/ml, occupying about 20-30% of the volume of the cytosol.<ref name=Ellis>{{cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Macromolecular crowding: obvious but underappreciated |journal=Trends Biochem.

These cells were also able to synthesize proteins if given ATP and amino acids, implying that many of the enzymes in cytosol are bound to the cytoskeleton.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hudder A, Nathanson L, Deutscher MP |title=Organization of Mammalian Cytoplasm |journal=Mol.

In prokaryotes the cytosol contains the cell's [[genome]], within a structure known as a [[nucleoid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thanbichler M, Wang S, Shapiro L |title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure |journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=506–21 |year=2005 |pmid=15988757 |doi=10.1002/jcb.20519}}</ref> This is an irregular mass of [[DNA]] and associated proteins that control the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA replication|replication]] of the bacterial [[chromosome]] and [[plasmid]]s. In eukaryotes the genome is held within the [[cell nucleus]], which is separated from the cytosol by [[nuclear pore]]s that block the free diffusion of any molecule larger than about 10&nbsp;[[nanometre]]s in diameter.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peters R |title=Introduction to nucleocytoplasmic transport: molecules and mechanisms |journal=Methods Mol.

This high concentration of macromolecules in cytosol causes an effect called [[macromolecular crowding]], which is when the [[activity (chemistry)|effective concentration]] of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This crowding effect can produce large changes in both the [[reaction rate|rates]] and the position of [[chemical equilibrium]] of reactions in the cytosol.<ref name=Ellis/> It is particularly important in its ability to alter [[dissociation constant]]s by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form [[protein complex]]es, or when [[DNA-binding protein]]s bind to their targets in the [[genome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhou HX, Rivas G, Minton AP |title=Macromolecular crowding and confinement: biochemical, biophysical, and potential physiological consequences |journal=Annu Rev Biophys |volume=37 |issue= |pages=375–97 |year=2008 |pmid=18573087 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125817 |pmc=2826134}}</ref>

==Organization==
Although the components of the cytosol are not separated into regions by cell membranes, these components do not always mix randomly and several levels of organization can localize specific molecules to defined sites within the cytosol.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Norris V, den Blaauwen T, Cabin-Flaman A |title=Functional Taxonomy of Bacterial Hyperstructures |journal=Microbiol.

===Concentration gradients===
Although small molecules [[diffusion|diffuse]] rapidly in the cytosol, concentration gradients can still be produced within this compartment. A well-studied example of these are the "calcium sparks" that are produced for a short period in the region around an open [[calcium channel]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang SQ, Wei C, Zhao G |title=Imaging microdomain Ca2+ in muscle cells |journal=Circ.

===Protein complexes===
Proteins can associate to form [[protein complex]]es, these often contain a set of proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Srere PA |title=Complexes of sequential metabolic enzymes |journal=Annu.

===Protein compartments===
Some protein complexes contain a large central cavity that is isolated from the remainder of the cytosol. One example of such an enclosed compartment is the [[proteasome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Groll M, Clausen T |title=Molecular shredders: how proteasomes fulfill their role |journal=Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=665–73 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14675543 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959440X03001635 |doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2003.10.005}}</ref> Here, a set of subunits form a hollow barrel containing [[protease]]s that degrade cytosolic proteins. Since these would be damaging if they mixed freely with the remainder of the cytosol, the barrel is capped by a set of regulatory proteins that recognize proteins with a signal directing them for degradation (a [[ubiquitin]] tag) and feed them into the proteolytic cavity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nandi D, Tahiliani P, Kumar A, Chandu D |title=The ubiquitin-proteasome system |journal=J.

Another large class of protein compartments are [[bacterial microcompartments]], which are made of a protein shell that encapsulates various enzymes.<ref name=Bobik2007>{{cite journal | author = Bobik, T.

===Cytoskeletal sieving===
Although the [[cytoskeleton]] is not part of the cytosol, the presence of this network of filaments restricts the diffusion of large particles in the cell. For example, in several studies tracer particles larger than about 25&nbsp;[[nanometre]]s (about the size of a [[ribosome]])<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cate JH |title=Construction of low-resolution x-ray crystallographic electron density maps of the ribosome |journal=Methods |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=303–8 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11860284 |doi=10.1006/meth.2001.1242}}</ref>  were excluded from parts of the cytosol around the edges of the cell and next to the nucleus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Provance DW, McDowall A, Marko M, Luby-Phelps K |title=Cytoarchitecture of size-excluding compartments in living cells |journal=J.

These microdomains could influence the distribution of large structures such as [[ribosome]]s and organelles within the cytosol by excluding them from some areas and concentrating them in others.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Luby-Phelps K |title=Effect of cytoarchitecture on the transport and localization of protein synthetic machinery |journal=J.

==Function==
The cytosol has no single function and is instead the site of multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include [[signal transduction]] from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the [[cell nucleus]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kholodenko BN |title=Four-dimensional organization of protein kinase signaling cascades: the roles of diffusion, endocytosis and molecular motors |journal=J.

This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol.<ref name=Verkman/> However, [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] molecules, such as [[fatty acid]]s or [[sterol]]s, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weisiger RA |title=Cytosolic fatty acid binding proteins catalyze two distinct steps in intracellular transport of their ligands |journal=Mol.
