{{infobox californium}}
'''Californium''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] metallic [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Cf''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;98. The element was first made at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1950 by bombarding [[curium]] with [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium-4]] [[ion]]s). It is an [[actinide]] element, the sixth [[transuranium element]] to be [[synthetic element|synthesized]], and has the second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]] (after [[einsteinium]]). The element was named after [[California]] and the [[University of California]]. It is the heaviest element to occur naturally on Earth; heavier elements can only be produced by synthesis.

Two [[Crystal structure|crystalline forms]] exist for californium under normal pressure: one above 900&nbsp;°C and one below 900 °C. A third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. [[Compounds of californium]] are dominated by a chemical form of the element, designated californium(III), that can participate in three [[chemical bond]]s. The most stable of californium's twenty known [[isotope]]s is californium-251, which has a [[half-life]] of 898&nbsp;years. This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust.{{efn|name=age of earth}} Californium-252, with a half-life of about 2.64&nbsp;years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the United States and the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in Russia.

Californium is one of the few transuranium elements that have practical applications. Most of these applications exploit the property of certain [[isotopes of californium]] to emit [[neutron]]s. For example, californium can be used to help start up [[nuclear reactor]]s, and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials with [[neutron diffraction]] and [[neutron spectroscopy]].  Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements; [[ununoctium]] (element&nbsp;118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with [[calcium-48]] ions. Use of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element's ability to disrupt the formation of [[red blood cell]]s by [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulating]] in skeletal tissue.

== Characteristics ==

=== Physical properties ===
Californium is a silvery white [[actinide]] metal{{sfn|Jakubke|1994|p=166}} with a [[melting point]] of 900&nbsp;± 30&nbsp;°C and an estimated [[boiling point]] of 1745&nbsp;K.{{sfn|Haire|2006|pp=1522–1523}} The pure metal is malleable and is easily cut with a razor blade. Californium metal starts to vaporize above 300&nbsp;°C when exposed to a vacuum.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1526}} Below 51&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]<!-- KEEP IN KELVIN --> (−220&nbsp;°C) californium metal is either [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] or [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]] (it acts like a magnet), between 48 and 66&nbsp;K it is [[antiferromagnetic]] (an intermediate state), and above 160&nbsp;K<!-- KEEP IN KELVIN --> (−110&nbsp;°C) it is [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] (external magnetic fields can make it magnetic).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1525}} It forms [[alloy]]s with [[lanthanide]] metals but little is known about them.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1526}}

The element has two [[Crystal structure|crystalline forms]] under 1 standard atmosphere of pressure: A double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close-packed]] form dubbed alpha (α) and a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] form designated beta (β).{{efn|A double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) [[unit cell]] consists of two hexagonal close-packed structures that share a common hexagonal plane, giving dhcp an ABACABAC sequence.{{sfn|Szwacki|2010|p=80}} }} The α form exists below 900&nbsp;°C with a density of 15.10 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and the β form exists above 900&nbsp;°C with a density of 8.74 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} At 48&nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|GPa]] of pressure the β form changes into an [[orthorhombic crystal system]] due to de-localization of the atom's [[Electron shell|5f electrons]], which frees them to bond.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}}{{efn|The three lower-mass transplutonium elements—[[americium]], [[curium]], and [[berkelium]]—require much less pressure to delocalize their 5f electrons.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}} }}

The [[bulk modulus]] of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure. Californium's bulk modulus is 50&nbsp;± 5&nbsp;GPa, which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium (70&nbsp;GPa).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}}

Californium-249 is formed from the [[beta decay]] of berkelium-249, and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a [[nuclear reactor]].{{sfn|CRC|2006|p=4.8}} Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high [[neutron capture]]) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high [[neutron cross-section]]).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1504}}

To produce californium, a microgram-sized target of curium-242 ({{Nuclide|curium|242}}) was bombarded with 35&nbsp;MeV-[[alpha particle]]s ({{Nuclide|helium|4}}) in the {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[cyclotron]] at [[Berkeley, California]], which produced californium-245 ({{Nuclide|californium|245}}) plus one [[free neutron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}).{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=103}}

Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment,{{sfn|Seaborg|1996|p=82}} and these atoms had a half-life of 44&nbsp;minutes.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=103}}

The discoverers named the new element after California and the [[University of California]]. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=849}}{{efn|[[Europium]], in the sixth period directly above element 95, was named for the continent it was discovered on, so element 95 was named [[americium]]. Element 96 was named for [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] as an analog to the naming of [[gadolinium]], which was named for the scientist and engineer [[Johan Gadolin]]. [[Terbium]] was named for the city it was discovered in, so element 97 was named [[berkelium]].{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=848}} }} However, the element directly above element&nbsp;98 in the periodic table, [[dysprosium]], has a name that simply means "hard to get at" so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention.{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=347}} They added that "the best we can do is to point out [that] ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California."{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=848}}

== Production ==
{{see also|Nuclear fuel cycle}}
Californium is produced in [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[particle accelerator]]s.{{sfn|Krebs|2006|pp=327–328}} Californium-250 is made by bombarding berkelium-249 ({{nuclide|Bk|249}}) with neutrons, forming berkelium-250 ({{nuclide|Bk|250}}) via [[neutron capture]] (n,γ)  which, in turn, quickly [[beta decay]]s (β<sup>−</sup>) to californium-250 ({{nuclide|Cf|250}}) in the following reaction:{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=348}}
:{{nuclide|Bk|249}}(n,γ){{nuclide|Bk|250}} → {{nuclide|Cf|250}} + β<sup>−</sup>
Bombardment of californium-250 with neutrons produces californium-251 and californium-252.{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=348}}

Prolonged irradiation of [[americium]], curium, and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium-252 and microgram amounts of californium-249.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=105}} As of 2006, curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium-252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1503}}

Microgram quantities of californium-252 are available for commercial use through the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]].{{sfn|Krebs|2006|pp=327–328}} Only two sites produce californium-252 – the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, and the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia]]. As of 2003, the two sites produce 0.25&nbsp;grams and 0.025&nbsp;grams of californium-252 per year, respectively.{{sfn|NRC|2008|p=33}}

Three californium isotopes with significant half-lives are produced, requiring a total of 15 neutron captures by [[uranium-238]] without [[nuclear fission]] or alpha decay occurring during the process.{{sfn|NRC|2008|p=33}} Californium-253 is at the end of a production chain that starts with uranium-238, includes several [[isotopes of plutonium]], [[isotopes of americium|americium]], [[isotopes of curium|curium]], [[isotopes of berkelium|berkelium]], and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).

== Precautions ==
Californium that [[bioaccumulate]]s in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts the body's ability to form [[red blood cell]]s.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=106}} The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=90}}

Californium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.<ref name="ANL2005" /><!-- for the whole paragraph -->

The element is most dangerous if taken into the body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through [[gamma ray]] emission. [[Ionizing radiation]] emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer.<ref name="ANL2005" /><!-- for the whole paragraph -->
