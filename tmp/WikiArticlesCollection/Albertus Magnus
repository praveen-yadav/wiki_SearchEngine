'''Albertus Magnus''', [[Dominican Order|O.P.]] (1193/1206&nbsp;– November 15, 1280), also known as '''Albert the Great''' and '''Albert of Cologne''', is a Catholic saint.  He was a German [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] and a [[Catholic bishop]]. Those such as James A. Weisheipl and Joachim R. Söder have referred to him as the greatest German philosopher and theologian of the [[Middle Ages]], an opinion supported by contemporaries such as [[Roger Bacon]].<ref>Joachim R. Söder, “Albert der Grosse – ein staunen-
erregendes Wunder,” Wort und Antwort 41 (2000): 145; J.A. Weisheipl, “Albertus Magnus,” Joseph Strayer ed., Dictionary of the Middle Ages 1 (New York: Scribner, 1982) 129.</ref> The [[Catholic Church]] honours him as a [[Doctor of the Church]], one of only 35 persons with that honour.

==Biography==
Albertus was born sometime before 1200 in [[Lauingen]] in [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]].<ref>Simon Tugwell, Albert and Thomas, New York Paulist Press, 1988, p. 3, 96, 97</ref> Contemporaries such as [[Roger Bacon]] applied the term "Magnus" to Albertus during his own lifetime, referring to his immense reputation as a scholar and philosopher.

Albertus was educated principally at [[University of Padua|Padua]], where he received instruction in Aristotle's writings. A late account by Rudolph de Novamagia refers to Albertus' encounter with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], who convinced him to enter [[Holy Orders]]. In 1223 (or 1229)<ref>Simon Tugwell, Albert and Thomas, New York Paulist Press, 1988, p. 4, 5</ref> he became a member of the Dominican Order, against the wishes of his family, and studied [[theology]] at [[Bologna]] and elsewhere. Selected to fill the position of lecturer at Cologne, Germany, where the Dominicans had a house, he taught for several years there, at [[Regensburg]], [[Freiburg]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Hildesheim]]. During his first tenure as lecturer at Cologne, Albert wrote his ''Summa de bono'', after discussing the transcendental properites of being with Philip the Chancellor.<ref name="Kovach, Francs 1980, p.X">Kovach, Francs, and Rober Shahan. Albert the Great: Commemorative Essays . Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press , 1980, p.X</ref> In 1245 he went to [[Paris]], received his doctorate and taught for some time as a master of theology with great success. During this time [[Thomas Aquinas]] began to study under Albertus. While teaching [[Thomas Aquinas]], Albertus still held true to this teachings and influences from other ancient philosophers. Although he was friar, he understood many natural aspects of the world such as metaphysics, physics, and mathematics.<ref>Kennedy, D. (1907). St. Albertus Magnus. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved September 19, 2013 from New Advent: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm</ref>

Albertus was the first to comment on virtually all of the writings of [[Aristotle]], thus making them accessible to wider academic debate. The study of Aristotle brought him to study and comment on the teachings of Muslim academics, notably Avicenna and Averroes, and this would bring him into the heart of academic debate.
He was ahead of his time in his attitude towards science. Two aspects of this attitude deserve to be mentioned: 1) he did not only study science from books, as other academics did in his day, but actually observed and experimented with nature (the rumours started by those who did not understand this are probably at the source of Albert's supposed connections with alchemy and witchcraft), 2) he took from Aristotle the view that scientific method had to be appropriate to the objects of the scientific discipline at hand.

In 1245, Albert became master of theology under Gueric of Saint-Quentin, the first German Dominican to achieve this distinction. Following this huge turn of events, Albert was able to teach theology at the University of Paris as a full time professor.<ref name="Kovach, Francs 1980, p.X"/> It was during this time, that Thomas Aquinas began his three year studying under Albert.

In 1254 Albertus was made [[provincial superior|provincial]] of the Dominican Order,<ref name=kennedy>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |title=Kennedy, Daniel. "St. Albertus Magnus." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 9 Jun. 2013 |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref> and fulfilled the arduous duties of the office with great care and efficiency. During his tenure he publicly defended the Dominicans against attacks by the secular and regular faculty of the [[University of Paris]], commented on [[John the Evangelist|St John]], and answered what he perceived as errors of the [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] [[Averroes]].

In 1259 Albert took part in the General Chapter of the [[Dominican Order]] at [[Valenciennes]] together with [[Thomas Aquinas]], masters Bonushomo Britto,<ref>{{cite book |title=Histoire literaire de la France: XIIIe siècle |volume= 19 |page= 103 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=LIYNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=bonushomo#v=onepage&q=bonushomo&f=false |accessdate=Accessed October 27, 2012}}</ref> Florentius,<ref>Probably Florentius de Hidinio, aka Florentius Gallicus, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LIYNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Histoire literaire de la France: XIIIe siècle''], Volume 19, p. 104,   Accessed October 27, 2012</ref> and [[Pope Innocent V|Peter]] establishing a ''ratio studiorum'' or program of studies for the [[Dominican Order]]<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=pf4hAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA701#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics''], Volume 10, p. 701. Accessed 9 June 2011</ref> that featured the study of philosophy as an innovation for those not sufficiently trained to study theology.  This innovation initiated the tradition of Dominican scholastic philosophy put into practice, for example, in 1265 at the Order's ''studium provinciale'' at the convent of [[Santa Sabina]] in Rome, out of which would develop the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]<ref>[http://www.domcentral.org/study/opstudy.htm "The Place of Study In the Ideal of St. Dominic"], J. A. Weisheipl, O.P. (1923-1984), 1960.  Accessed 19 March 2013</ref>

In 1260 [[Pope Alexander IV]] made him [[Bishop of Regensburg]], an office from which he resigned after three years. During the exercise of his duties he enhanced his reputation for humility by refusing to ride a horse—in accord with the dictates of the Dominican order—instead walking back and forth across his huge diocese. This earned him the affectionate sobriquet, "boots the bishop," from his parishioners. After his stint as bishop, he spent the remainder of his life partly in retirement in the various houses of his order, yet often preaching throughout southern Germany. In 1270 he preached the [[eighth Crusade]] in [[Austria]]. After this, he was especially known for acting as a mediator between conflicting parties (In Cologne he is not only known for being the founder of Germany's oldest university there, but also for "the big verdict" (der Große Schied) of 1258, which brought an end to the conflict between the citizens of Cologne and the archbishop.
Among the last of his labors was the defense of the orthodoxy of his former pupil, [[Thomas Aquinas]], whose death in 1274 grieved Albertus (the story that he travelled to Paris in person to defend the teachings of Aquinas can not be confirmed).

[[File:2004 Köln Sarkophag Albertus Magnus.JPG|thumb|Roman [[sarcophagus]] containing the relics of Albertus Magnus in the crypt of [[St. Andrew's Church, Cologne]], Germany]]
After suffering a collapse of health in 1278, he died on November 15, 1280, in Cologne, [[Germany]]. Since November 15, 1954, his relics are in a Roman sarcophagus in the [[crypt]] of the Dominican St. [[Andreas]] church in Cologne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gemeinden.erzbistum-koeln.de/st_andreas_koeln/albertusMagnus/ |title=Zeittafel |publisher=Gemeinden.erzbistum-koeln.de |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref>

Albertus is frequently mentioned by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], who made his doctrine of [[free will]] the basis of his ethical system. In his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Dante places Albertus with his pupil Thomas Aquinas among the great lovers of wisdom (''Spiriti Sapienti'') in the Heaven of the Sun. Albertus is also mentioned, along with [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Paracelsus]], in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', in which his writings influence a young [[Victor Frankenstein]].

Albertus was [[beatified]] in 1622. He was [[canonized]] and proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] on December 16, 1931 by [[Pope Pius XI]] and patron saint of natural scientists in 1941. St Albert's [[feast day]] is celebrated on November 15. According to Joan Carroll Cruz, his body is [[incorruptibility|incorrupt]].<ref name="Cruz 1977">{{cite book|title=The Incorruptibles: A Study of the Incorruption of the Bodies of Various Catholic Saints and Beati|authorlink=Joan Carroll Cruz|last=Carroll Cruz|first=Joan|publisher=[[TAN Books]]|location=[[Charlotte, NC]]|year=1977|isbn=0-89555-066-0}}</ref>

==Writings==
[[Image:Albertus Magnus-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Albertus Magnus monument at the [[University of Cologne]].]]
Albertus' writings collected in 1899 went to thirty-eight volumes. These displayed his prolific habits and literally encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as [[logic]], [[theology]], [[botany]], [[geography]], [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[mineralogy]], [[alchemy]], [[zoology]], [[physiology]], [[phrenology]], [[justice]], [[law]], [[friendship]] and [[love]] as well. He digested, interpreted and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. Most modern knowledge of Aristotle was preserved and presented by Albertus.

Albertus' activity, however, was more philosophical than theological (see [[Scholasticism]]). The philosophical works, occupying the first six and the last of the twenty-one volumes, are generally divided according to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] scheme of the sciences, and consist of interpretations and condensations of Aristotle's relative works, with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics, and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master.

His principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the Books of the Sentences of [[Peter Lombard]] (''Magister Sententiarum''), and the ''Summa Theologiae'' in two volumes. The latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former.

==Natural philosopher==
[[Image:Albertus Magnus Painting by Joos van Gent.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Painting by [[Joos van Wassenhove|Joos (Justus) van Gent]], [[Urbino]], ~ 1475]]
Albertus's knowledge of physical science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate. His industry in every department was great, and though we find in his system many gaps which are characteristic of scholastic philosophy, his protracted study of [[Aristotle]] gave him a great power of systematic thought and exposition. An exception to this general tendency is his Latin treatise "De falconibus" (later inserted in the larger work, ''De Animalibus'', as book 23, chapter 40), in which he displays impressive actual knowledge of a) the differences between the [[birds of prey]] and the other kinds of birds; b) the different kinds of [[falcon]]s; c) the way of preparing them for the [[Hunting|hunt]]; and d) the cures for sick and wounded falcons.<ref>An Smets, "Le réception en langue vulgaire du "De falconibus" d'Albert le Grand," in: ''Medieval Forms of Argument: Disputation and Debate'', ed. Georgiana Donavin, Carol Poster, and Richard Utz (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2002), pp. 189–99.</ref> His scholarly legacy justifies his contemporaries' bestowing upon him the honourable surname ''Doctor Universalis.''

==Alchemy and Astrology==
In the centuries since his death, many stories arose about Albertus as an [[Alchemy|alchemist]] and magician. On the subject of alchemy and chemistry, many treatises relating to ''Alchemy'' have been attributed to him, though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject, and then mostly through commentary on Aristotle. For example, in his commentary, ''De mineralibus'', he refers to the power of stones, but does not elaborate on what these powers might be.<ref>Georg Wieland, “Albert der Grosse.  Der Entwurf einer eigenständigen Philosophie,” Philosophen des Mittelalters  (Darmstadt: Primus, 2000) 124-39.</ref> A wide range of Pseudo-Albertine works dealing with alchemy exist, though, showing the belief developed in the generations following Albert's death that he had mastered alchemy, one of the fundamental sciences of the Middle Ages. These include ''Metals and Materials''; the ''Secrets of Chemistry''; the ''Origin of Metals''; the ''Origins of Compounds'', and a ''Concordance ''which is a collection of ''Observations on the [[philosopher's stone]]''; and other alchemy-chemistry topics, collected under the name of ''Theatrum Chemicum''.<ref>Walsh, John, ''The Thirteenth, Greatest of Centuries.'' 1907:46.[http://books.google.com/books?id=_rofAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA46&dq=albertus+magnus+gold+minerals#PRA2-PA46,M1 Available online.]</ref> He is credited with the discovery of the element [[arsenic]]<ref name="BuildingBlocks451-3">{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5 |pages=43,513,529 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford}}</ref> and experimented with photosensitive chemicals, including [[silver nitrate]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Davidson | first = Michael W. | coauthors = National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at The Florida State University | title = Molecular Expressions: Science, Optics and You&nbsp;— Timeline&nbsp;— Albertus Magnus | publisher = The Florida State University | date = 2003-08-01 | url = http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/magnus.html | accessdate = 2009-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Szabadváry | first = Ferenc

However, there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments.

According to legend, Albertus Magnus is said to have discovered the [[philosopher's stone]] and passed it to his pupil [[Thomas Aquinas]], shortly before his death. Albertus does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by "transmutation."<ref>Julian Franklyn and Frederick E. Budd. ''A Survey of the Occult.'' Electric Book Company. 2001. p. 28-30. ISBN 1-84327-087-0.</ref> Given that Thomas Aquinas died six years before Albertus Magnus' death, this legend as stated is unlikely.

However, it is true that Albertus was deeply interested in astrology, as has been articulated by scholars such as Paola Zambelli.<ref>Paola Zambelli, "The Speculum Astronomiae and its Enigma" Dordrecht.</ref> In the high Middle Ages — and well into the early modern period — few intellectuals, if any, questioned the basic assumptions of astrology: humans live within a web of celestial influences that affect our bodies, and thereby motivate us to behave in certain ways. Within this worldview, it was reasonable to believe that astrology could be used to predict the probable future of a human being. Albertus made this a central component of his philosophical system, arguing that an understanding of the celestial influences affecting us could help us to live our lives more in accord with Christian precepts. The most comprehensive statement of his astrological beliefs is to be found in a work he authored around 1260, now known as the ''[[Speculum astronomiae]]''. However, details of these beliefs can be found in almost everything he wrote, from his early ''Summa de bono'' to his last work, the ''Summa theologiae''.

==Experimental Sciences==
Albert drew upon the information he had at his disposal for experimental science from the writings of Aristotle. In ''De Miner'' Albert claims, "The aim of natural philosophy (science) is not to simply to accept the statements of others, but to investigate the causes that are at work in nature". The Aristotelianism greatly influences Albert's view on nature and philosophy.<ref name="newadvent.org">Kennedy, D. (1907). St. Albertus Magnus. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved November 10, 2013 from New Advent: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm</ref> Another example of his reason to formally search for the causes is in his treaties on plants, he begins with the principle, experiment is the only safe guide in such investigations. His studies of Aristotle and theology show their colors in nearly all of his works and volumes. Albert never stopped learning about experimental sciences, throughout his research and experimentation Albert became proficient in countless areas of physical science, such as; physics, geography, astronomy, mineralogy, alchemy and even [[phrenology]]. Albert showed the world that the Catholic Church wasn't totally opposed to the studying of nature and other similar areas.<ref name="newadvent.org"/>
Albert placed emphasis on experiment as well as investigation. But, Albert respected authority and tradition so many of his investigations or experiments were unpublished. Albert would often keep silent about many issues such as astronomy, physics and such because he felt that his theories were too advanced for the time he was living in.<ref name="newadvent.org"/>

==Matter and Form==
Albert believed that natural things were composed of composition of matter and form, he referred to it as quod est and quo est. Albert also believed that God alone is absolute ruling entity. Albert's vrson of hylemorphism is very standard to Aristotelianism but he also took a some concepts from [[Avicenna]].<ref>Kovach, Francs, and Rober Shahan. Albert the Great: Commemorative Essays . Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press , 1980, p. 133-135</ref>

==Music==
Albertus is known for his enlightening commentary on the musical practice of his times. Most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Poetics''. He rejected the idea of "[[Musica universalis|music of the spheres]]" as ridiculous: movement of astronomical bodies, he supposed, is incapable of generating sound. He wrote extensively on proportions in music, and on the three different subjective levels on which [[plainchant]] could work on the human soul: purging of the impure; illumination leading to contemplation; and nourishing perfection through contemplation. Of particular interest to 20th-century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music.

==Metaphysics of Morals==
Both of his early treaties, ''De natura boni'' and ''De bono'', start with a metaphysical investigation into the concepts of the good in general and the physical good. Albert refers to the physical good as bonum naturae. Albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics. In Albert's later works, he says in order to understand human or moral goodness, the individual must first recognize what it means to be good and do good deeds. This procedure reflects Albert's preoccupations with neo-Platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of Pseudo-Dionysius.<ref>Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p. 93</ref> Albert's view was highly valued by the Catholic Church and his peers.

==Natural Law==
The last tractatus of ''De Bono'' devoted to Albert's theory of justice. Albert's natural-law theory comes from the last tractatus of ''De Bono''. The concept mimics the historical evolution of law in the Middle Ages. Albert places God as the pinnacle of justice and natural law. Albert also mentions that God makes up the laws and his authority is above everyone else's.   Up until this time, the only other works specifically devoted to natural law written by a theologian or philosophers. In the law section in William of Auxerre's '' Summa aurea'', William proceed his analysis of the cardinal virtues and lastly, Philip the Chancellor's ''Summa de bono'', the book makes some mention of natural law but doesn't go into detail.<ref>Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.207</ref>

==Friendship==
Albertus mentions friendship in his work, ''De bono'', as well as presenting his ideals and morals of friendship in the very beginning of ''Tractatus II''. Later in his life he publishes ''Super Ethica''.<ref>Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.242</ref> With his development of friendship throughout his work this is evident that friendship ideals and morals took relevance as his life went on. Albert comments on Aristotle's view of friendship with a quote from [[Cicero]], who writes, "friendship is nothing other than the harmony between things divine and human , with goodwill and love. Albert agrees with this commentary but he also adds in harmony or agreement.<ref>Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.243</ref> Albert calls this harmony, consensiom is itself a certain kind of movement within the human spirit. Albert fully agrees with Aristotle in the sense that friendship is a virtue. Albert relates the inherent metaphysical contentedness between friendship and moral goodness. Albert describes several levels of goodness; the useful (utile), the pleasurable (delectabile) and the authentic or unqualified good (honestum). Then in turn there are three levels of friendship based on each of those levels. Friendship based on usefulness (amicitia utilis), friendship based on pleasure (amicitia delectabilis), and friendship rooted in unqualified goodness (amicitia honesti; amicitia quae fundatur super honestum).<ref>Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.244</ref>
