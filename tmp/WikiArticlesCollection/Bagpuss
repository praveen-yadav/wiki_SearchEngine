'''''Bagpuss''''' is a UK [[children's television series]], made by [[Peter Firmin]] and [[Oliver Postgate]] from 20 February 1974 to 15 May 1974 through their company [[Smallfilms]]. The title character was "an old, saggy cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams".<ref name="Smallfilms">{{cite web |url= http://www.smallfilms.co.uk/bagpuss/intro.htm |title=Bagpuss&nbsp;– The intro|accessdate=11 November 2007 |work=The Smallfilms Treasury| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071221021416/http://www.smallfilms.co.uk/bagpuss/intro.htm| archivedate= 21 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Although only 13 episodes were made, it remains fondly remembered,<ref name="BBC">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7773124.stm |title=Bagpuss&nbsp;– See Emily Play |accessdate=12 September 2008 |work=BBC | date=9 December 2008}}</ref> and was frequently repeated in the UK for 13 years.<ref name=ODNB>{{citation |last=Hayward |first=Anthony |contribution=Postgate, (Richard) Oliver (1925–2008) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/100678 |accessdate=28 May 2012}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> In 1999 ''Bagpuss'' topped a BBC poll for the UK's favourite children's TV programme.

==Format==
Each programme began in the same way: through a series of [[sepia tone|sepia]] photographs, the viewer is told of a little girl named Emily (played by Emily Firmin, the daughter of illustrator Firmin),<ref>{{cite web |last=Duffy |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7773124.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; See Emily play |publisher=BBC News |date=9 December 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> who owned a shop. Emily found lost and broken things and displayed them in the window, so their owners could come and collect them; the shop did not sell anything. She would leave the object in front of her favourite stuffed toy, the large, saggy, pink and white striped cat named Bagpuss, originally intended by Firmin to be a retired Indian Army cat who entertained children in the hospital with his "visible" thoughts appearing in a "thinks bubble" above his head. When Postgate and Firmin were asked to develop this character for a BBC programme Postgate placed him in the shop with other characters and his "thinks bubble" became a way to illustrate the stories and mend or explore the objects that Emily had found. Emily then recited a verse:<ref name="Smallfilms"/>

{{quote|Bagpuss, dear Bagpuss<br />Old Fat Furry Catpuss<br />Wake up and look at this thing that I bring<br />Wake up, be bright, be golden and light<br />Bagpuss, oh hear what I sing}}

When Emily had left, Bagpuss woke up. The programme shifted from sepia to colour [[stop motion]] film, and various toys in the shop came to life: Gabriel the toad (who, unlike most Smallfilms characters, could move by a special device beneath his can without the use of stop motion animation) and a [[rag doll]] called Madeleine. The wooden woodpecker bookend became the drily academic Professor [[Yaffle]] (based on the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], whom Postgate had once met<ref>[[Channel 4]] News, 9 December 2008.</ref>), while the mice carved on the side of the "mouse organ" (a small mechanical [[pipe organ]] that played rolls of music) woke up and scurried around, singing in high-pitched voices. [[Sandra Kerr]] and [[John Faulkner (musician)|John Faulkner]] provided the voices of Madeleine and Gabriel respectively, and put together and performed all the proper songs. All the other voices (including the narrator and one out-of-tune mouse) were provided by [[Oliver Postgate|Postgate]], who also wrote the stories.

The toys discussed what the new object was; someone (usually Madeleine) would tell a story related to the object (shown in an animated thought bubble over Bagpuss's head), often with a song, accompanied by Gabriel on the [[banjo]] (which often sounded a lot more like a guitar), and then the mice, singing in high-pitched squeaky harmony to the tune of ''[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]'' as they worked, mended the broken object.  The newly mended thing was then be put in the shop window, so that whoever had lost it would see it as they went past, and could come in and claim it. Then Bagpuss would start yawning again, and as he fell asleep the narrator would speak as the colour faded to sepia and they all became toys again.

==Production==
[[File:BagpussCharacters.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The characters of Bagpuss]]

The programmes were made using [[stop motion|stop-frame animation]]. Bagpuss is an actual cloth cat, but was not intended to be such an electric pink. "It should have been a ginger marmalade cat but the company in [[Folkestone]] dyeing the material made a mistake and it turned out pink and cream. It was the best thing that ever happened," said Firmin.<ref name="Adscene">
{{cite news |title=Saggy old cloth cat pulls in the crowds |work=Canterbury Adscene |publisher=Kent Regional News and Media |pages=4–5 |date=9 November 2007}}</ref>

Madeleine the rag doll was made by Firmin's wife, Joan, with an extra long dress to hold their children's nightdresses, but Postgate decided it would serve better as one of the characters.

Gabriel the Toad was the only character in the series who could move freely without the use of stop-frame animation. Scenes featuring him playing the banjo and singing would have taken quite a bit of time if filmed with the stop-frame method, so Peter Firmin created a mechanism that helped him control Gabriel through a hole in his can.

Bagpuss has now retired to the [[Rupert Bear Museum]] in [[Canterbury]], part of the [[Museum of Canterbury]], together with other characters and Emily's shop window.<ref name="KentMessengerRupert2003">{{cite news |url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/newsarchive.aspx?articleid=9341 |newspaper=Kent Messenger |date=14 April 2003 |title=Easter opening for Rupert Bear museum |accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>

Most of the stories and songs used in the series are based on folk songs and [[fairy tale]]s from around the world.

==Recognition==
In 1987 the [[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] awarded [[honorary degrees]] to Postgate and Firmin. In his speech, Postgate stated that the degree was really intended for Bagpuss, who was subsequently displayed in academic dress.<ref name="CANTCHRO">{{cite web |url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/arts/campus/chronicle.html |title=A Canterbury Chronicle |work=Arts, leisure and public events |publisher=University of Kent |accessdate=29 November 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930024111/http://www.kent.ac.uk/arts/campus/chronicle.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=30 September 2007}}</ref>

In 1999 the series came first in a BBC poll selecting the nation's favourite children's show.<ref name="news">{{cite news |title=Entertainment: Bagpuss cream of television |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=1 October 1999 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/246080.stm |accessdate=21 September 2007 | location=London}}</ref> It also came fourth in the 2001 [[Channel 4]] poll The [[100 Greatest Kids' TV shows]].<ref name="chan4">{{cite news |title=Simpsons tops kids' TV poll |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=28 September 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1512890.stm |accessdate=21 September 2007}}</ref>

In 2002 and 2005 a stage show of ''Bagpuss'' songs toured UK [[folk festival]]s and theatres with original singers [[Sandra Kerr]] and [[John Faulkner (musician)|John Faulkner]], along with Kerr's daughter [[Nancy Kerr]] and her husband, James Fagan.

In June 2002, the charity [[Hospices of Hope]] opened the Bagpuss Children's Wing in its hospice in [[Brașov]], [[Romania]].  The wing was funded entirely by [[Oliver Postgate|Postgate]] from [[royalties]] received from the [[BBC]]. In April 2012, [[Marc Jenner]] from [[Tunbridge Wells]] in Kent ran in the [[Virgin London Marathon]] dressed in a {{convert|7|ft|adj=on}} Bagpuss costume to raise money for the charity, supported by [[Emily Firmin]] and [[Oliver Postgate|Postgate]]'s family.

[[Thom Yorke]] of the band [[Radiohead]] has claimed to be a fan of the show, watching it with his son. It was an influence for 2003 album [[Hail to the Thief]].
