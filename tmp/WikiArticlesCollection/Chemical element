A '''chemical element''' is a pure [[chemical substance]] consisting of one type of [[atom]] distinguished by its [[atomic number]], which is the number of [[proton]]s in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. Elements are divided into [[metal]]s, [[metalloid]]s, and [[non-metal]]s. Familiar examples of elements include [[carbon]], [[oxygen]] ([[non-metal]]s), [[silicon]], [[arsenic]] ([[metalloid]]s), [[aluminium]], [[iron]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[lead]] ([[metal]]s).

The lightest chemical elements, including [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] (and smaller amounts of [[lithium]], [[beryllium]] and [[boron]]), are thought to have been produced by various cosmic processes during the [[Big Bang]] and [[cosmic ray|cosmic-ray]] [[spallation]]. Production of heavier elements, from carbon to the very heaviest elements, proceeded by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], and these were made available for later [[Solar System|solar system]] and planetary formation by [[planetary nebula]]e and [[supernova]]e, which blast these elements into space.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Synthesis of the Elements in Stars|author=E. M. Burbidge, G. R. Burbidge, W. A. Fowler, F. Hoyle|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=29|issue=4|pages=547–650|year=1957|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.547|bibcode=1957RvMP...29..547B}}</ref> The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars, after the lighter gaseous elements and their compounds have been subtracted. While most elements are generally viewed as stable, a small amount of natural [[nuclear transmutation|transformation]] of one element to another also occurs at the present time through decay of radioactive elements as well as other natural nuclear processes.

The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive [[society|human societies]] that found native elements like copper and gold and extracted ([[smelting|smelted]]) [[iron]] and a few other metals from their [[ore]]s. [[Alchemy|Alchemist]]s and [[chemistry|chemists]] subsequently identified many more, with nearly all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. The properties of the chemical elements are often summarized using the [[periodic table]] that organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows ([[period (periodic table)|"periods"]]) in which the columns ([[group (periodic table)|"groups"]]) share recurring ("periodic") physical and chemical properties. Save for short-half-life radioactive elements, all of the elements are available [[industry|industrially]], most of them to high degrees of purity.

[[Hydrogen]] and [[helium]] are by far the most abundant elements in the [[universe]]. However, iron is the [[abundances of the elements (data page)|most abundant]] element (by mass) making up the Earth, and [[oxygen]] is the most common element in Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]].<ref name=LosAlamos>{{cite web|title=Periodic Table of Elements: Oxygen|author=Los Alamos National Laboratory|authorlink=Los Alamos National Laboratory|publisher=Los Alamos National Security, LLC|location=Los Alamos, New Mexico|year=2011|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref> Although all known chemical [[matter]] is composed of these elements, chemical matter itself is hypothesized to constitute only about 15% of the matter in the universe. The remainder is believed to be [[dark matter]], a mysterious substance that is not composed of chemical elements, since it lacks [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s or [[electron]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Theory of Almost Everything: The Standard Model, the Unsung Triumph of Modern Physics |last=Oerter |first=Robert |year=2006 |publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=978-0-452-28786-0 |page=223 }}</ref>

When two or more distinct elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by [[chemical bond]]s, the result is termed a [[chemical compound]]. Two thirds of the chemical elements occur on Earth only as compounds, and in the remaining third, often the compound forms of the element are most common.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Chemical compounds may be composed of elements combined in exact whole-number ratios of atoms, as in [[water]], [[sodium chloride|table salt]], and minerals such as [[quartz]], [[calcite]], and some [[ore]]s. However, chemical bonding of many types of elements results in [[Crystallinity|crystalline]] [[solid]]s and [[metal]]lic [[alloy]]s for which exact [[chemical formula]]s do not exist. Relatively pure samples of isolated elements are uncommon in nature. While all of the 98 naturally occurring elements have been identified in [[mineral]] samples from Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], only a small minority of elements are found as recognizable, relatively pure [[mineral]]s. Among the more common of such "[[native element minerals|native elements]]" are [[copper]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[carbon]] (as [[coal]], [[graphite]], or [[diamond]]s), [[sulfur]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as [[noble gas]]es and [[noble metal]]s, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as [[chemical compound]]s. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined form, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric [[atmosphere|air]] is primarily a mixture of [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[argon]], and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel.

As of November 2011, 118 elements have been identified, the latest being [[ununseptium]] in 2010.<ref name="Oganessian2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.142502|title=Synthesis of a New Element with Atomic Number Z=117|publisher=Physical Review Letter |volume=104|issue=14|edition=142502|year=2010|first1=Yu.

Of the 98 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through 40 are all considered [[stable isotope|stable]]. Elements with atomic numbers 41 through 82 are [[Metastability|apparently stable]] (except [[technetium]], element 43 and [[promethium]], element 61, which are unstable) but theoretically unstable, and thus possibly mildly radioactive.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/periodic/physical_natural.htm | title =Naturally-Occurring and Synthetic Elements | author =angelo.edu | publisher =''[[Angelo State University]]'' | date =}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/43.shtml | title =PERIODIC TABLE OF ELEMENTS: LANL | author =lanl.gov | publisher =''[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]'' | date =}}</ref> The half-lives of elements 41 through 82 are so long, however, that their radioactive decay remains undetected by experiment.

These 98 elements have been detected in the universe at large, in the spectra of stars and also supernovae, where short-lived radioactive elements are newly being made. The first 98 elements have been detected directly on Earth as [[primordial nuclide]]s present from the formation of the solar system, or as naturally-occurring fission or transmutation products of uranium and thorium.

The remaining 24 heavier elements, not found today either on Earth or in astronomical spectra, have been derived artificially. All of the heavy elements that are derived solely through artificial means are radioactive, with very short half-lives; if any atoms of these elements were present at the formation of Earth, they are extremely likely to have already decayed, and if present in novae, have been in quantities too small to have been noted. [[Technetium]] was the first purportedly non-naturally occurring element synthesized, in 1937, although trace amounts of technetium have since been found in nature (and also the element may have been discovered naturally in 1925).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/technetium.html | title =Technetium-99 | publisher =epa.gov | author =''[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'' | accessdate =26 February 2013}}</ref> This pattern of artificial production and later natural discovery has been repeated with several other radioactive naturally-occurring rare elements.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/text/text_stel_6.html | title =ORIGIN OF HEAVY ELEMENTS | publisher =cfa.harvard.edu | author =''[[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]]'' | accessdate =26 February 2013}}</ref>

Lists of the elements are available [[List of elements|by name]], [[Symbol (chemical element)|by symbol]], [[List of elements|by atomic number]], [[List of elements|by density]], [[List of elements|by melting point]], and [[List of elements|by boiling point]] as well as [[Molar ionization energies of the elements|ionization energies of the elements]]. The nuclides of stable and radioactive elements are also available as a [[list of nuclides]], sorted by length of half-life for those that are unstable. One of the most convenient, and certainly the most traditional presentation of the elements, is in the form of the [[periodic table]], which groups together elements with similar chemical properties (and usually also similar electronic structures).

===Atomic number===
{{main|atomic number}}
The [[atomic number]] of an element is equal to the number of protons that defines the element.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/HighSchool/Radiography/atomicmassnumber.htm | title =ATOMIC NUMBER AND MASS NUMBERS | publisher =ndt-ed.org |accessdate =17 February 2013}}</ref> For example, all carbon atoms contain 6 protons in their [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]; so the atomic number of carbon is 6.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml | title =PERIODIC TABLE OF ELEMENTS: LANL Carbon | author =periodic.lanl.gov | publisher =''[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]''}}</ref> Carbon atoms may have different numbers of neutrons; atoms of the same element having different numbers of neutrons are known as [[isotope]]s of the element.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://faculty.piercecollege.edu/yamadak/classes/Atomic%20mass.pdf | title =Atomic mass, isotopes, and mass number. | author =Katsuya Yamada | publisher =''[[Los Angeles Pierce College]]''}}</ref>

The number of protons in the atomic nucleus also determines its [[electric charge]], which in turn determines the number of [[electron]]s of the atom in its [[ionization|non-ionized]] state. The electrons are placed into [[atomic orbital]]s that determine the atom's various [[chemical property|chemical properties]]. The number of neutrons in a nucleus usually has very little effect on an element's chemical properties (except in the case of [[hydrogen]] and [[deuterium]]). Thus, all carbon isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties because they all have six protons and six electrons, even though carbon atoms may differ in number of neutrons. It is for this reason that atomic number rather than [[mass number]] or [[Relative atomic mass|atomic weight]] is considered the identifying characteristic of a chemical element.

The symbol for atomic number is ''Z''.

===Atomic mass and atomic weight===
{{main|atomic mass|relative atomic mass}}

The [[mass number]] of an element, ''A'', is the number of [[nucleon]]s (protons and neutrons) in the atomic nucleus. Different isotopes of a given element are distinguished by their mass numbers, which are conventionally written as a super-index on the left hand side of the atomic symbol (e.g., <sup>238</sup>U). The mass number is always a simple whole number and has units of "nucleons." An example of a referral to a mass number is "magnesium-24," which is an atom with 24 nucleons (12 protons and 12 neutrons).

Whereas the [[mass number]] simply counts the total number of neutrons and protons and is thus a natural (or whole) number, the [[atomic mass]] of a single atom is a [[real number]] for the mass of a particular isotope of the element, the unit being '''[[atomic mass unit|u]]'''. In general, when expressed in '''u''' it differs in value slightly from the mass number for a given nuclide (or isotope) since the mass of the protons and neutrons is not exactly 1 '''u''', since the electrons contribute a lesser share to the atomic mass as neutron number exceeds proton number, and (finally) because of the [[nuclear binding energy]]. For example, the atomic weight of chlorine-35 to five significant digits is 34.969 '''u''' and that of chlorine-37 is 36.966 '''u'''. However, the atomic mass in '''u''' of pure isotope atoms is quite close to its simple mass number (always within 1%). The only exception to the atomic mass of an isotope atom not being a [[natural number]] is <sup>12</sup>C, which by definition has a mass of exactly 12, because '''u''' is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a free neutral carbon-12 atom in the ground state.

The [[relative atomic mass]] (historically and commonly also called "atomic weight") of an element is the ''average'' of the atomic masses of all the chemical element's isotopes as found in a particular environment, weighted by isotopic abundance, relative to the [[atomic mass unit]] ('''u'''). This number may be a fraction that is ''not'' close to a whole number, due to the averaging process. For example, the relative atomic mass of chlorine is 35.453 '''u''', which differs greatly from a whole number due to being made of an average of 76% chlorine-35 and 24% chlorine-37. Whenever a relative atomic mass value differs by more than 1% from a whole number, it is due to this averaging effect resulting from significant amounts of more than one isotope being naturally present in the sample of the element in question.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotope|Stable isotope|List of nuclides}}
[[Isotope]]s are atoms of the same element (that is, with the same number of protons in their atomic nucleus), but having ''different'' numbers of [[neutron]]s. Most (66 of 94) naturally occurring elements have more than one stable isotope. Thus, for example, there are three main isotopes of carbon. All carbon atoms have 6 protons in the nucleus, but they can have either 6, 7, or 8 neutrons. Since the mass numbers of these are 12, 13 and 14 respectively, the three isotopes of carbon are known as carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14, often abbreviated to <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>14</sup>C. Carbon in everyday life and in chemistry is a mixture of <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, and (a very small fraction of) <sup>14</sup>C atoms.

Except in the case of the isotopes of hydrogen (which differ greatly from each other in relative mass—enough to cause chemical effects), the isotopes of a given element are chemically nearly indistinguishable.

All of the elements have some isotopes that are radioactive ([[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]]), although not all of these radioisotopes occur naturally. The radioisotopes typically decay into other elements upon radiating an [[Alpha particle|alpha]] or [[Beta particle|beta]] particle. If an element has isotopes that are not radioactive, these are termed "stable" isotopes. All of the known stable isotopes occur naturally (see [[primordial nuclide|primordial isotope]]). The many radioisotopes that are not found in nature have been characterized after being artificially made. Certain elements have no stable isotopes and are composed ''only'' of radioactive isotopes: specifically the elements without any stable isotopes are technetium (atomic number 43), promethium (atomic number 61), and all observed elements with atomic numbers greater than 82.

Of the 80 elements with at least one stable isotope, 26 have only one single stable isotope. The mean number of stable isotopes for the 80 stable elements is 3.1 stable isotopes per element. The largest number of stable isotopes that occur for a single element is 10 (for tin, element 50).

===Allotropes===
{{Main|Allotropy}}
Atoms of pure elements (a pure element is one that consists of only one stable isotope<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/p/pure-element.htm |title=Pure element |publisher=[[European Nuclear Society]] |accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref>) may bond to each other chemically in more than one way, allowing the pure element to exist in multiple structures (spacial arrangements of atoms), known as [[Allotropy|allotropes]], which differ in their properties. For example, carbon can be found as [[diamond]], which has a tetrahedral structure around each carbon atom; [[graphite]], which has layers of carbon atoms with a hexagonal structure stacked on top of each other; [[graphene]], which is a single layer of graphite that is very strong; [[fullerene]]s, which have nearly spherical shapes; and [[carbon nanotube]]s, which are tubes with a hexagonal structure (even these may differ from each other in electrical properties). The ability of an element to exist in one of many structural forms is known as 'allotropy'.

The [[standard state]], also known as reference state, of an element is defined as its thermodynamically most stable state at 1 bar at a given temperature (typically at 298.15 K). In [[thermochemistry]], an element is defined to have an [[Standard enthalpy of formation|enthalpy of formation]] of zero in its standard state. For example, the reference state for carbon is graphite, because the structure of graphite is more stable than that of the other allotropes.

===Properties===
Several kinds of descriptive categorizations can be applied broadly to the elements, including consideration of their general physical and chemical properties, their states of matter under familiar conditions, their melting and boiling points, their densities, their crystal structures as solids, and their origins.

====General properties====
Several terms are commonly used to characterize the general physical and chemical properties of the chemical elements. A first distinction is between [[metal]]s, which readily conduct [[electricity]],  [[nonmetal]]s, which do not, and a small group, (the ''[[metalloid]]s''), having intermediate properties and often behaving as [[semiconductor]]s.

A more refined classification is often shown in colored presentations of the periodic table. This system restricts the terms "metal" and "nonmetal" to only certain of the more broadly defined metals and nonmetals, adding additional terms for certain sets of the more broadly viewed metals and nonmetals. The version of this classification used in the periodic tables presented here includes: [[actinide]]s, [[alkali metal]]s, [[alkaline earth metal]]s, [[halogen]]s, [[lanthanide]]s, [[poor metal]]s; [[metalloid]]s, [[noble gas]]es, [[polyatomic nonmetal]]s, [[diatomic nonmetal]]s, and [[transition metal]]s. In this system, the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and transition metals, as well as the lanthanides and the actinides, are special groups of the metals viewed in a broader sense. Similarly, the polyatomic nonmetals, diatomic nonmetals  and the noble gases are nonmetals viewed in the broader sense. In some presentations, the halogens are not distinguished, with [[astatine]] identified as a metalloid and the others identified as nonmetals.

====States of matter====
Another commonly used basic distinction among the elements is their [[state of matter]] (phase), whether [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]], at a selected standard temperature and pressure ([[standard temperature and pressure|STP]]). Most of the elements are solids at conventional temperatures and atmospheric pressure, while several are gases. Only [[bromine]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] are liquids at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) and normal atmospheric pressure; [[caesium]] and [[gallium]] are solids at that temperature, but melt at 28.4 °C (83.2 °F) and 29.8 °C (85.6 °F), respectively.

====Melting and boiling points====
[[Melting point|Melting]] and [[boiling point|boiling]] points, typically expressed in degrees Celsius at a pressure of one atmosphere, are commonly used in characterizing the various elements. While known for most elements, either or both of these measurements is still undetermined for some of the radioactive elements available in only tiny quantities. Since [[helium]] remains a liquid even at [[absolute zero]] at atmospheric pressure, it has only a boiling point, and not a melting point, in conventional presentations.

====Densities====
The [[density]] at a selected standard temperature and pressure ([[standard temperature and pressure|STP]]) is frequently used in characterizing the elements. Density is often expressed in [[gram]]s per cubic centimeter (g/cm<sup>3</sup>). Since several elements are gases at commonly encountered temperatures, their densities are usually stated for their gaseous forms; when liquefied or solidified, the gaseous elements have densities similar to those of the other elements.

When an element has [[Allotropy|allotrope]]s with different densities, one representative allotrope is typically selected in summary presentations, while densities for each allotrope can be stated where more detail is provided. For example, the three familiar allotropes of [[carbon]] ([[amorphous carbon]], [[graphite]], and [[diamond]]) have densities of 1.8–2.1, 2.267, and 3.515 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively.

====Crystal structures====
The elements studied to date as solid samples have eight kinds of [[crystal]] structures: [[cubic crystal system|cubic]], [[cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]], [[cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]], [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]], [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]], [[orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]], [[Trigonal crystal system|rhombohedral]], and [[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]]. For some of the synthetically produced transuranic elements, available samples have been too small to determine crystal structures.

====Occurrence and origin on Earth====
Chemical elements may also be categorized by their origin on Earth, with the first 98 considered naturally occurring, while those with atomic numbers beyond 98 have only been produced artificially as the synthetic products of man-made nuclear reactions.

Of the 98 naturally occurring elements, 84 are considered [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] and either [[stable isotope|stable]] or [[metastability|metastable]] (apparently stable but theoretically [[Radionuclide|unstable]], or radioactive). The remaining 14 naturally occurring elements possess [[Half-life|half lives]] too short for them to have been present at the beginning of the [[Solar System]], and are therefore considered transient elements. Of these 14 transient elements, 7 ([[polonium]], [[astatine]], [[radon]], [[francium]], [[radium]], [[actinium]], and [[protactinium]]) are relatively common [[decay products]] of [[thorium]], [[uranium]], and [[plutonium]]. The remaining 7 transient elements ([[technetium]], [[promethium]], [[neptunium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], and [[californium]]) occur only rarely, as products of rare nuclear reaction processes involving uranium or other heavy elements.

Elements with atomic numbers 1 through 40 are all stable, while those with atomic numbers 41 through 82 (except technetium and promethium) are metastable. The half-lives of these metastable "[[List_of_nuclides#Nuclides_with_no_experimentally_observed_decays|theoretical radionuclides]]" are so long (at least 100 million times longer than the estimated [[age of the universe]]) that their radioactive decay has yet to be detected by experiment. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 98 are unstable to the point that their radioactive decay can be detected. Some of these elements, notably thorium (atomic number 90) and uranium (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] that produced the heavy elements before the formation of our solar system. For example, at over 1.9{{e|19}} years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, [[bismuth-209]] (atomic number 83) has the longest known [[alpha decay]] half-life of any naturally occurring element.<ref name="Dume2003"/><ref name=Marcillac2003>{{cite journal|last=de Marcillac|first=P|coauthors= Coron N, Dambier G, Leblanc J, Moalic J-P|year=2003|title=Experimental detection of alpha-particles from the radioactive decay of natural bismuth|journal=Nature|volume=422|pages=876–8|doi=10.1038/nature01541|pmid=12712201|issue=6934|bibcode = 2003Natur.422..876D }}</ref> The very heaviest elements (those beyond californium, atomic number 98) undergo radioactive decay with half-lives so short that they do not occur in nature and must be synthesized.

===The periodic table===
{{Main|Periodic table}}
{{Periodic table}}

The properties of the chemical elements are often summarized using the [[periodic table]], which powerfully and elegantly organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows ([[period (periodic table)|"periods"]]) in which the columns ([[group (periodic table)|"groups"]]) share recurring ("periodic") physical and chemical properties. The current standard table contains 118 confirmed elements as of 10 April 2010.

Although earlier precursors to this presentation exist, its invention is generally credited to the Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] in 1869, who intended the table to illustrate recurring trends in the properties of the elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time as new elements have been discovered and new theoretical models have been developed to explain chemical behavior.

Use of the periodic table is now ubiquitous within the academic discipline of chemistry, providing an extremely useful framework to classify, systematize and compare all the many different forms of chemical behavior. The table has also found wide application in [[physics]], [[geology]], [[biology]], [[materials science]], [[engineering]], [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[nutrition]], [[environmental health]], and [[astronomy]]. Its principles are especially important in [[chemical engineering]].

==Nomenclature and symbols==
{{anchor|Nomenclature}}
The various chemical elements are formally identified by their unique atomic numbers, by their accepted names, and by their symbols.

===Atomic numbers===
The known elements have atomic numbers from 1 through 118, conventionally presented as [[Arabic numerals]]. Since the elements can be uniquely sequenced by atomic number, conventionally from lowest to highest (as in a [[periodic table]]), sets of elements are sometimes specified by such notation as "through", "beyond", or "from ... through", as in "through iron", "beyond uranium", or "from lanthanum through lutetium". The terms "light" and "heavy" are sometimes also used informally to indicate relative atomic numbers (not densities!), as in "lighter than carbon" or "heavier than lead", although technically the weight or mass of atoms of an element (their atomic weights or atomic masses) do not always increase [[monotonic function|monotonically]] with their atomic numbers.

===Element names===
{{main|List of chemical element name etymologies}}
The naming of various substances now known as elements precedes the atomic theory of matter, as names were given locally by various cultures to various minerals, metals, compounds, alloys, mixtures, and other materials, although at the time it was not known which chemicals were elements and which compounds. As they were identified as elements, the existing names for anciently-known elements (e.g., gold, mercury, iron) were kept in most countries. National differences emerged over the names of elements either for convenience, linguistic niceties, or nationalism. For a few illustrative examples: German speakers use "Wasserstoff" (water substance) for "hydrogen", "Sauerstoff" (acid substance) for "oxygen" and "Stickstoff" (smothering substance) for "nitrogen", while English and some [[romance language]]s use "sodium" for "natrium" and "potassium" for "kalium", and the French, Italians, Greeks, Portuguese and Poles prefer "azote/azot/azoto" (from roots meaning "no life") for "nitrogen".

For purposes of international communication and trade, the [[Table of chemical elements|official names]] of the chemical elements both ancient and more recently recognized are decided by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC), which has decided on a sort of international English language, drawing on traditional English names even when an element's chemical symbol is based on a Latin or other traditional word, for example adopting "gold" rather than "aurum" as the name for the 79th element (Au). IUPAC prefers the British spellings "[[aluminium]]" and "caesium" over the U.S. spellings "aluminum" and "cesium", and the U.S. "sulfur" over the British "sulphur". However, elements that are practical to sell in bulk in many countries often still have locally used national names, and countries whose national language does not use the [[Latin alphabet]] are likely to use the IUPAC element names.

According to IUPAC, chemical elements are not proper nouns in English; consequently, the full name of an element is not routinely capitalized in English, even if derived from a [[proper noun]], as in [[californium]] and [[einsteinium]]. Isotope names of chemical elements are also uncapitalized if written out, ''e.g.,'' [[carbon-12]] or [[uranium-235]]. Chemical element ''symbols'' are always capitalized (see below).

In the second half of the twentieth century, physics laboratories became able to produce nuclei of chemical elements with half-lives too short for an appreciable amount of them to exist at any time. These are also named by IUPAC, which generally adopts the name chosen by the discoverer. This practice can lead to the controversial question of which research group actually discovered an element, a question that has delayed naming of elements with atomic number of 104 and higher for a considerable time. (See [[element naming controversy]]).

Precursors of such controversies involved the nationalistic namings of elements in the late 19th century. For example, ''[[lutetium]]'' was named in reference to Paris, France. The Germans were reluctant to relinquish naming rights to the French, often calling it ''cassiopeium''. Similarly, the British discoverer of ''[[niobium]]'' originally named it ''columbium,'' in reference to the [[New World]]. It was used extensively as such by American publications prior to international standardization.

===Chemical symbols===
{{for|the listing of current and not used [[Chemical symbol]]s, and other symbols that look like chemical symbols|List of elements by symbol}}

====Specific chemical elements====
Before chemistry became a [[science]], [[alchemy|alchemists]] had designed arcane symbols for both metals and common compounds. These were however used as abbreviations in diagrams or procedures; there was no concept of atoms combining to form molecules. With his advances in the atomic theory of matter, [[John Dalton]] devised his own simpler symbols, based on circles, to depict molecules.

The current system of chemical notation was invented by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|Berzelius]]. In this typographical system, chemical symbols are not mere abbreviations—though each consists of letters of the [[Latin alphabet]]. They are intended as universal symbols for people of all languages and alphabets. 

The first of these symbols were intended to be fully universal. Since Latin was the common language of science at that time, they were abbreviations based on the [[Latin]] names of metals. Cu comes from Cuprum, Fe comes from Ferrum, Ag from Argentum. The symbols were not followed by a period (full stop) as with abbreviations. Later chemical elements were also assigned unique chemical symbols, based on the name of the element, but not necessarily in English. For example, [[sodium]] has the chemical symbol 'Na' after the Latin ''natrium''. The same applies to "W" (wolfram) for [[tungsten]], "Fe" (ferrum) for [[iron]], "Hg" (hydrargyrum) for [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], "Sn" (stannum) for [[Tin (element)|tin]], "K" (kalium) for [[potassium]], "Au" (aurum) for [[gold]], "Ag" (argentum) for [[silver]], "Pb" (plumbum) for [[lead]], "Cu" (cuprum) for [[copper]], and "Sb" (stibium) for [[antimony]].

Chemical symbols are understood internationally when element names might require translation. There are sometimes differences. For example, the Germans have used "J" instead of "I" for iodine, so the character would not be confused with a [[Roman numeral]].

The first letter of a chemical symbol is always capitalized, as in the preceding examples, and the subsequent letters, if any, are always lower case (small letters). Thus, the symbols for californium or einsteinium are Cf and Es.

====General chemical symbols====
There are also symbols for series of chemical elements, for comparative formulas. These are one capital letter long, and the letters are reserved so they can't be used for names of specific elements. For example, an "'''X'''" indicates a variables group amongst a class of compounds (though usually a [[halogen]]), while "'''R'''" is a [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], meaning a compound structure such as a hydrocarbon chain. The letter "'''Q'''" is reserved for "heat" in a chemical reaction. "'''Y'''" is also often used as a general chemical symbol, although it is also the symbol of [[yttrium]]. "'''Z'''" is also frequently used as a general variable group. "'''L'''" is used to represent a general [[ligand]] in inorganic and organometallic chemistry. "'''M'''" is also often used in place of a general metal. At least two additional, two-letter generic chemical symbols are also in informal usage, "'''Ln'''" for any [[lanthanide]] element and "'''An'''" for any [[actinide]] element.

====Isotope symbols====
Isotopes are distinguished by the atomic mass number (total protons and neutrons) for a particular isotope of an element, with this number combined with the pertinent element's symbol. IUPAC prefers that isotope symbols be written in superscript notation when practical, for example <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>235</sup>U. However, other notations, such as carbon-12 and uranium-235, or C-12 and U-235, are also used.

As a special case, the three naturally occurring isotopes of the element [[hydrogen]] are often specified as '''H''' for <sup>1</sup>H ([[Hydrogen atom|protium]]), '''D''' for <sup>2</sup>H ([[deuterium]]), and '''T''' for <sup>3</sup>H ([[tritium]]). This convention is easier to use in chemical equations, replacing the need to write out the mass number for each atom. For example, the formula for [[heavy water]] may be written D<sub>2</sub>O instead of <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O.

==Origin of the elements==
[[File:080998 Universe Content 240.jpg|thumb|375px|Estimated distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe. Only the fraction of the mass and energy in the universe labeled "atoms" is composed of chemical elements.]]

Only about 4% of the total mass of the universe is made of atoms or [[ions]], and thus represented by chemical elements. This fraction is about 15% of the total matter, with the remainder of the matter (85%) being [[dark matter]]. The nature of dark matter is unknown, but it is not composed of atoms of chemical elements because it contains no protons, neutrons, or electrons. (The remaining non-matter part of the mass of the universe is composed of the even more mysterious [[dark energy]]).

The universe's 92 naturally occurring chemical elements are thought to have been produced by at least four [[cosmos|cosmic]] processes. Most of the [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] in the universe was produced primordially in the first few minutes of the [[Big Bang]]. Three recurrently occurring later processes are thought to have produced the remaining elements. Stellar [[nucleosynthesis]], an ongoing process, produces all elements from [[carbon]] through [[iron]] in atomic number, but little [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], or [[boron]]. Elements heavier in atomic number than iron, as heavy as [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]], are produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in [[supernova]]s and other cataclysmic cosmic events. [[Cosmic ray spallation]] (fragmentation) of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] is important to the production of [[lithium]], [[beryllium]] and [[boron]].

During the early phases of the [[Big Bang]], [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] of hydrogen nuclei resulted in the production of hydrogen-1 ([[protium]], <sup>1</sup>H) and helium-4 (<sup>4</sup>He), as well as a smaller amount of [[deuterium]] (<sup>2</sup>H) and very minuscule amounts (on the order of 10<sup>−10</sup>) of lithium and beryllium. Even smaller amounts of boron may have been produced in the Big Bang, since it has been observed in some very old stars, while carbon has not.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilford|first=JN|date=14 January 1992|title=Hubble Observations Bring Some Surprises|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D91F3AF937A25752C0A964958260|work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref> It is generally agreed that no heavier elements than boron were produced in the Big Bang. As a result, the primordial abundance of atoms (or ions) consisted of roughly 75% <sup>1</sup>H, 25% <sup>4</sup>He, and 0.01% [[deuterium]], with only tiny traces of lithium, beryllium, and perhaps boron.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=EL|date=12 September 2004|title=Big Bang Nucleosynthesis|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBNS.html|publisher=[[UCLA]], Division of Astronomy|accessdate=22 February 2007}}</ref> Subsequent enrichment of [[galactic spheroid|galactic halo]]s occurred due to [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].<ref name=synthesis>{{cite journal|year=1999|title=Synthesis of the elements in stars: forty years of progress|url=http://www.cococubed.com/papers/wallerstein97.pdf|journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]|volume=69|issue=4|pages=995–1084|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.995|bibcode=1997RvMP...69..995W|last1=Wallerstein|first1=George|last2=Iben|first2=Icko|last3=Parker|first3=Peter|last4=Boesgaard|first4=Ann|last5=Hale|first5=Gerald|last6=Champagne|first6=Arthur|last7=Barnes|first7=Charles|last8=Käppeler|first8=Franz|last9=Smith|first9=Verne|display-authors=8}}</ref> However, the element abundance in [[intergalactic space]] can still closely resemble primordial conditions, unless it has been enriched by some means.

On Earth (and elsewhere), trace amounts of various elements continue to be produced from other elements as products of natural [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] processes. These include some produced by [[cosmic ray]]s or other nuclear reactions (see [[cosmogenic nuclide|cosmogenic]] and [[nucleogenic]] nuclides), and others produced as [[decay product]]s of long-lived [[primordial nuclide]]s.<ref name=Earnshaw1997>{{cite book|last=Earnshaw|first=A|last2=Greenwood|first2=N|year=1997|title=Chemistry of the Elements|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|isbn=}}</ref> For example, trace (but detectable) amounts of [[carbon-14]] (<sup>14</sup>C) are continually produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays impacting [[nitrogen]] atoms, and argon-40 (<sup>40</sup>Ar) is continually produced by the decay of primordially occurring but unstable potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K). Also, three primordially occurring but radioactive [[actinide]]s, [[thorium]], [[uranium]], and [[plutonium]], decay through a series of recurrently produced but unstable radioactive elements such as radium and [[radon]], which are transiently present in any sample of these metals or their ores or compounds. Seven other radioactive elements, [[technetium]], [[promethium]], [[neptunium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], and [[californium]], occur only incidentally in natural materials, produced as individual atoms by natural [[nuclear fission|fission]] of the [[Nucleus (atomic structure)|nuclei]] of various heavy elements or in other rare nuclear processses.

[[Human]] [[technology]] has produced various additional elements beyond these first 98, with those through atomic number 118 now known.

==Abundance==
{{Main|Abundance of the chemical elements}}

The following graph (note log scale) shows the abundance of elements in our solar system. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy (estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million, by mass.<ref name=croswell>{{cite book|last=Croswell|first=K|year=1996|title=Alchemy of the Heavens|url=http://kencroswell.com/alchemy.html|publisher=Anchor|isbn=0-385-47214-5}}</ref> Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. As physical laws and processes appear common throughout the [[visible universe]], however, scientist expect that these galaxies evolved elements in similar abundance.

The abundance of elements in the [[Solar System]] is in keeping with their origin from nucleosynthesis in the [[Big Bang]] and a number of progenitor supernova stars. Very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the Big Bang, but the next three elements are rare since they had little time to form in the Big Bang and are not made in stars (they are, however, produced in small quantities by the breakup of heavier elements in interstellar dust, as a result of impact by [[cosmic ray]]s). Beginning with carbon, elements are produced in stars by buildup from alpha particles (helium nuclei), resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). In general, such elements up to iron are made in large stars in the process of becoming [[supernova]]s. Iron-56 is particularly common, since it is the most stable element that can easily be made from alpha particles (being a product of decay of radioactive nickel-56, ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei). Elements heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large stars, and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases with their atomic number.

The [[abundance of the chemical elements]] on '''Earth''' varies from air to crust to ocean, and in various types of life. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust differs from that in the universe (and also in the Sun and heavy planets like Jupiter) mainly in selective loss of the very lightest elements (hydrogen and helium) and also volatile neon, carbon, nitrogen and sulfur, as a result of solar heating in the early formation of the solar system. Aluminum is also far more common in the Earth and Earth's crust than in the universe and solar system, but the composition of Earth's mantle (which has more magnesium and iron in place of aluminum) more closely mirrors that of the universe, save for the noted loss of volatile elements.

The [[composition of the human body]], by contrast, more closely follows the composition of [[seawater]]—save that the human body has additional stores of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] necessary to form the [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acids]] characteristic of living organisms. Certain kinds of [[organism]]s require particular additional elements, for example the [[magnesium]] in [[chlorophyll]] in green plants, the [[calcium]] in [[mollusc shell]]s, or the [[iron]] in the [[hemoglobin]] in [[vertebrate|vertebrate animal]]s' red blood cells.

[[File:SolarSystemAbundances.png|thumb|600px|Abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar system. Hydrogen and helium are most common, from the Big Bang. The next three elements (Li, Be, B) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance as elements become heavier. Iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae.]]

==History==
[[File:Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table.png|300px|thumb|[[Mendeleev]]'s 1869 [[periodic table]]]]

===Evolving definitions===
The concept of an "element" as an undivisible substance has developed through three major historical phases: Classical definitions (such as those of the ancient Greeks), chemical definitions, and atomic definitions.

====Classical definitions====
[[Ancient philosophy]] posited a set of [[classical element]]s to explain observed patterns in [[nature]]. These ''elements'' originally referred to ''[[Earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[Water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[Air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[Fire (classical element)|fire]]'' rather than the chemical elements of modern science.

The term 'elements' (''stoicheia'') was first used by the Greek philosopher [[Plato]] in about 360 BCE in his dialogue [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a speculative treatise on chemistry. Plato believed the elements introduced a century earlier by [[Empedocles]] were composed of small [[regular polyhedron|polyhedral]] [[Theory of Forms|forms]]: [[tetrahedron]] (fire), [[octahedron]] (air), [[icosahedron]] (water), and [[cube]] (earth).<ref>{{cite book|author=Plato|year=2008|origyear=c. 360 BC|title=Timaeus|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xSjvowNydN8C&lpg=PP1&dq=Plato%20timaeus&pg=PA45#v=onepage&q=cube&f=false|publisher=Forgotten Books|page=45|isbn=978-1-60620-018-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hillar|first=M|year=2004|title=The Problem of the Soul in Aristotle's De anima|url=http://www.socinian.org/aristotles_de_anima.html|publisher=[[NASA]]/[[WMAP]]|accessdate=10 August 2006}}</ref>

[[Aristotle]], c. 350 BCE, also used the term ''stoicheia'' and added a fifth element called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], which formed the heavens. Aristotle defined an element as:

{{quote|Element – one of those bodies into which other bodies can decompose, and that itself is not capable of being divided into other.<ref>{{cite book|last=Partington|first=JR|year=1937|title=A Short History of Chemistry|location=New York|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|isbn=0-486-65977-1}}</ref>}}

====Chemical definitions====
In 1661, [[Robert Boyle]] proposed his theory of corpuscularism which favoured the analysis of matter as constituted by irreducible units of matter (atoms) and, choosing to side with neither Aristotle's view of the four elements nor Paracelsus' view of three fundamental elements, left open the question of the number of elements.<ref name=boyle/> The first modern list of chemical elements was given in [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s 1789 ''Elements of Chemistry'', which contained thirty-three elements, including [[light]] and caloric.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lavoisier|first=AL|year=1790|title=Elements of chemistry translated by Robert Kerr|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4BzAjCpEK4gC&pg=PA175|place=Edinburgh|pages=175–6|isbn=978-0-415-17914-0}}</ref> By 1818, [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] had determined atomic weights for forty-five of the forty-nine then-accepted elements. [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] had sixty-six elements in his [[periodic table]] of 1869.
[[File:DIMendeleevCab.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dmitri Mendeleev]]
From Boyle until the early 20th century, an element was defined as a pure substance that could not be decomposed into any simpler substance.<ref name=boyle>{{cite book|first=R|last=Boyle|year=1661|title=The Sceptical Chymist|location=London|isbn=0-922802-90-4}}</ref> Put another way, a chemical element cannot be transformed into other chemical elements by chemical processes. Elements during this time were generally distinguished by their atomic weights, a property measurable with fair accuracy by available analytical techniques.

====Atomic definitions====
[[File:Henry Moseley.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Moseley]]
The 1913 discovery by English physicist [[Henry Moseley]] that the nuclear charge is the physical basis for an atom's atomic number, further refined when the nature of protons and [[neutrons]] became appreciated, eventually led to the current definition of an element based on atomic number (number of protons per atomic nucleus). The use of atomic numbers, rather than atomic weights, to distinguish elements has greater predictive value (since these numbers are integers), and also resolves some ambiguities in the chemistry-based view due to varying properties of [[isotope]]s and [[allotropes]] within the same element. Currently, [[IUPAC]] defines an element to exist if it has isotopes with a lifetime longer than the 10<sup>−14</sup> seconds it takes the nucleus to form an electronic cloud.<ref>[http://www.kernchemie.de/Transactinides/Transactinide-2/transactinide-2.html Transactinide-2]. www.kernchemie.de</ref>

By 1914, seventy-two elements were known, all naturally occurring.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carey|first=GW|year=1914|title=The Chemistry of Human Life|publisher=|location=Los Angeles|isbn=0-7661-2840-7}}</ref> The remaining naturally occurring elements were discovered or isolated in subsequent decades, and various additional elements have also been produced synthetically, with much of that work pioneered by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]]. In 1955, element 101 was discovered and named [[mendelevium]] in honor of D.I. Mendeleev, the first to arrange the elements in a periodic manner. Most recently, the synthesis of element 118 was reported in October 2006, and the synthesis of element 117 was reported in April 2010.<ref>{{cite news|last=Glanz| first=J|date=6 April 2010|title=Scientists Discover Heavy New Element|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/science/07element.html?hp|work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>

===Discovery and recognition of various elements===
{{See also|Timeline of chemical elements discoveries}}

Ten materials familiar to various prehistoric cultures are now known to be chemical elements: [[Carbon]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[iron]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[silver]], [[sulfur]], [[tin]], and [[zinc]]. Three additional materials now accepted as elements, [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], and [[bismuth]], were recognized as distinct substances prior to 1500 AD. [[Phosphorus]], [[cobalt]], and [[platinum]] were isolated before 1750.

Most of the remaining naturally occurring chemical elements were identified and characterized by 1900, including:
* Such now-familiar [[industry|industrial]] materials as [[aluminium]], [[silicon]], [[nickel]], [[chromium]], [[magnesium]], and [[tungsten]]
* Reactive metals such as [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]]
* The [[halogen]]s [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and [[iodine]]
* Gases such as [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[helium]], [[argon]], and [[neon]]
* Most of the [[rare-earth elements]], including [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], [[gadolinium]], and [[neodymium]], and
* The more common [[radioactive]] elements, including [[uranium]], [[thorium]], [[radium]], and [[radon]]

Elements isolated or produced since 1900 include:
* The three remaining undiscovered regularly occurring stable natural elements: [[hafnium]], [[lutetium]], and [[rhenium]]
* [[Plutonium]], which was first produced synthetically in 1940 by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], but is now also known from a few long-persisting natural occurrences
* The three incidentally occurring natural elements ([[neptunium]], [[promethium]], and [[technetium]]), which were all first produced synthetically but later discovered in trace amounts in certain geological samples
* Three scarce decay products of uranium or thorium, ([[astatine]], [[francium]], and [[protactinium]]), and
* Various synthetic [[transuranic]] elements, beginning with [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], and [[californium]]

===Recently discovered elements===
The first [[transuranium element]] (element with atomic number greater than 92) discovered was [[neptunium]] in 1940. Since 1999 claims for the discovery of new elements have been considered by the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party]]. As of May 2012, only the elements up to 112, [[copernicium]], as well as element 114 [[Flerovium]] and element 116 [[Livermorium]] have been confirmed as discovered by [[IUPAC]], while claims have been made for synthesis of elements [[Ununtrium|113]], [[Ununpentium|115]], [[Ununseptium|117]]<ref name=jinr>{{cite web|last=Greiner|first=W|date=|title=Recommendations|url=http://www.jinr.ru/img_sections/PAC/NP/31/PAK_NP_31_recom_eng.pdf|work=31st meeting, PAC for Nuclear Physics|publisher=[[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]]|accessdate=}}</ref> and [[Ununoctium|118]].

==List of the 118 known chemical elements==
The following sortable table includes the 118 known chemical elements, with the names linking to the ''Wikipedia'' articles on each.
* '''Atomic number''', '''name''', and '''symbol''' all serve independently as unique identifiers.
* '''Names''' are those accepted by [[IUPAC]]; provisional names for recently produced elements not yet formally named are in parentheses.
* '''Group, period,''' and '''block''' refer to an element's position in the [[periodic table]].
* '''State of matter''' ''(solid, liquid,'' or ''gas)'' applies at standard [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] conditions ([[Standard Temperature and Pressure|STP]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* '''Occurrence''' distinguishes naturally occurring elements, categorized as either ''primordial'' or ''transient'' (from decay), and additional ''synthetic'' elements that have been produced technologically, but are not known to occur naturally.
* '''Description''' summarizes an element's properties using the broad categories commonly presented in periodic tables: [[Actinide]], [[alkali metal]], [[alkaline earth metal]], [[halogen]], [[lanthanide]], [[metal]], [[metalloid]], [[noble gas]], [[non-metal]], and [[transition metal]].
