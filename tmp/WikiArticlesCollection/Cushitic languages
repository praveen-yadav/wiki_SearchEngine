The '''Cushitic languages''' are a branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]] spoken primarily in the [[Horn of Africa]] ([[Somalia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]], and [[Ethiopia]]), as well as the [[Nile Valley]] ([[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]]), and parts of the [[African Great Lakes]] region ([[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]). The branch is named after the Biblical character [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], who was traditionally identified as an ancestor of the speakers of these specific languages as early as 947 CE (in [[Masudi]]'s Arabic history ''[[Meadows of Gold]]''). 

The most populous Cushitic language is [[Oromo language|Oromo]] (including all its variations) with about 35 million speakers, followed by [[Somali language|Somali]] with about 18 million speakers, and [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]] with about 3 million speakers. Other Cushitic languages with more than one million speakers are [[Afar language|Afar]] (1.5 million) and [[Beja language|Beja]] (1.2 million).

Somali, one of the [[official language]]s of Somalia, is the only Cushitic language accorded official status in any country. It is also one of the recognized [[national language]]s of Djibouti, the other being Afar.

==Composition==
The Cushitic languages are usually considered to include the following branches:
* [[Beja language|Beja]] (North Cushitic)
* [[Central Cushitic languages|Central Cushitic]]
* [[Highland East Cushitic languages|Highland East Cushitic]]
* [[Lowland East Cushitic languages|Lowland East Cushitic]] 
* [[Dullay languages|Dullay]]
* [[South Cushitic languages|South Cushitic]]

Lowland and Highland East Cushitic are commonly combined with Dullay into a single branch called ''East Cushitic''.

==Divergent languages==
The Beja language, or ''North Cushitic,'' is sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic. However, it is more often included within the Afro-Asiatic family's Cushitic branch.

There are also a few poorly classified languages, including [[Yaaku language|Yaaku]], [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], [[Asa language|Aasax]], [[Kw'adza language|Kw'adza]], [[Boon language|Boon]], [[Mbugu language|Mbugu]] and [[Ongota]]. There is a wide range of opinions as to how these languages are interrelated.<ref name=Hayward>Richard Hayward, "Afroasiatic", in Heine & Nurse, 2000, ''African Languages''</ref>

The positions of the Dullay languages and Yaaku are uncertain. These have traditionally been assigned to an ''East Cushitic'' branch along with Highland (Sidamic) and Lowland East Cushitic. However, Hayward believes East Cushitic may not be a valid node and that its constituents should be considered separately when attempting to work out the internal relationships of Cushitic.<ref name=Hayward/>

The Afroasiatic identity of [[Ongota language|Ongota]] is also broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to the "mixed" appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data. [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic.<ref>[http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&T=1235007315045{haupt_harrassowitz=http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_3277.ahtml?T=1235007315045} Harrassowitz Verlag - The Harrassowitz Publishing House<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Bonny Sands (2009) believes the most convincing proposal is by Savà and Tosco (2003), namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[substratum]]. In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language while retaining some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.<ref name=Sava2003>{{cite book|author1-last=Savà|author1-first=Graziano|author2-last=Tosco|author2-first=Mauro|title=Selected comparative-historical Afrasian linguistic studies|year=2003|publisher=LINCOM Europa|editor-last=Bender|editor-first=M.

[[Robert Hetzron|Hetzron]] (1980:70ff)<ref>Robert Hetzron, "The Limits of Cushitic", ''Sprache und Geschichte in Afrika'' 2. 1980, 7–126. </ref> and Ehret (1995) have suggested that the [[Rift languages]] (South Cushitic) are a part of Lowland East Cushitic, the only one of the six groups with much internal diversity.

Cushitic was traditionally seen as also including the [[Omotic languages]], then called ''West Cushitic.'' However, this view has largely been abandoned, with Omotic generally agreed to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic, primarily due to the work of [[Harold C. Fleming]] (1974) and [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|M. Lionel Bender]] (1975).
