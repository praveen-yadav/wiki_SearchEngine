'''Albert Lawrence Brooks''' (born '''Albert Lawrence Einstein'''; July 22, 1947) is an American actor, voice actor, writer, comedian, and director. He received an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1987<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/aa87.html "Academy Awards 1987"]. filmsite.org.</ref> for his role in ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]''. His voice acting credits include Marlin the [[clownfish]] in ''[[Finding Nemo]],'' and recurring guest voices for the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]],'' including Russ Cargill in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. Additionally, he has written, directed and starred in several comedy films such as ''[[Modern Romance]]'' (1981), ''[[Lost in America]]'' (1985) and ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' (1991) and is the author of the satire, ''[[2030 (novel)|2030: The Real Story of What Happens to America]]'' (2011).

==Early life==
Brooks was born in [[Beverly Hills]], California, the son of [[Thelma Leeds]] (née Goodman), a singer and actress, and [[Harry Parke|Harry Einstein]], a radio comedian who performed on [[Eddie Cantor]]'s radio program and was known as Parkyakarkus.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/60/Albert-Brooks.html Albert Brooks Biography (1947–)]. filmreference.com</ref> His brothers are comedic actor [[Bob Einstein]], better known by his stage name "[[Super Dave Osborne]]," and Cliff Einstein, a partner and longtime chief creative officer at Los Angeles advertising agency Dailey & Associates. His half-brother was [[Charles Einstein]] (1926–2007), a writer for such television programs as ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' and ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]''. Brooks is Jewish;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egothemag.com/archives/2006/01/comedy_in_the_m.htm |title=Comedy in The Muslim World |work= EGO Magazine| date=January 2006|first=Rachel |last=Astarte Piccione |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210221819/http://www.egothemag.com/archives/2006/01/comedy_in_the_m.htm |archivedate=2006-02-10}}</ref> his grandparents emigrated from [[Austria]] and [[Russia]].

''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Buffalo News]]''. Accessed April 24, 2008. "Albert Brooks, who grew up in a showbiz family and attended Beverly Hills High School, has never been interested in being an outsider."</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
Brooks attended [[Carnegie Mellon]] in [[Pittsburgh]], but dropped out after one year to focus on his comedy career. He changed his surname from ''Einstein'' (to avoid confusion with the [[Albert Einstein|famous physicist]]) and began a comedy career that quickly made him a regular on variety and talk shows during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Brooks led a new generation of self-reflective baby-boomer comics appearing on NBC's  ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. His onstage persona, that of an [[egotistical]], [[narcissistic]], nervous comic, an ironic showbiz insider who punctured himself before an audience by disassembling his mastery of comedic stagecraft, influenced other '70s [[post-modern]] comedians, including [[Steve Martin]], [[Martin Mull]] and [[Andy Kaufman]].

After two successful comedy albums, ''Comedy Minus One'' (1973) and the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated ''A Star Is Bought'' (1975), Brooks left the stand-up circuit to try his hand as a filmmaker; his first film, ''The Famous Comedians School'', was a satiric short that appeared on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and was an early example of the [[mockumentary]] sub-genre.

In 1975, he directed six short films for the first season of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'':
*October 11, 1975 episode (host: [[George Carlin]]) – "The Impossible Truth"
*October 18, 1975 episode (host: [[Paul Simon]]) – failed ''[[Candid Camera]]'' stunts and home movies
*October 25, 1975 episode (host: [[Rob Reiner]]) – heart surgery
*November 8, 1975 episode (host: [[Candice Bergen]]) – upcoming season
*December 13, 1975 episode (host: [[Richard Pryor]]) – sick
*January 9, 1976 episode (host: [[Elliott Gould]]) - audience test screening

In 1976 he appeared in his first mainstream film role, in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s landmark ''[[Taxi Driver]]''; Scorsese allowed Brooks to improvise much of his dialogue. The role reflected Brooks's decision to move to Los Angeles to enter the film business. In an interview, Brooks mentioned a conversation he'd had with ''Taxi Driver'' screenwriter Paul Schrader, in which Schrader said that Brooks's character was the only one in the movie that he could not "understand" – a remark that Brooks found amusing, as the movie's antihero was a psychotic loner.

Brooks directed his first feature film, ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'', in 1979. The film, in which Brooks obnoxiously films a typical suburban family in an effort to win both an [[Academy award|Oscar]] and a Nobel Prize, was a sendup of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''[[An American Family]]'' documentary. It has also been viewed as foretelling the future emergence of reality television.<ref>Montoya, Maria (February 28, 2009). [http://blog.nola.com/davewalker/2009/02/albert_brooks_real_life_film_i.html "Albert Brooks 'Real Life' film is an unexpected classic"]. ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''.</ref> Brooks also made a cameo appearance in the film ''[[Private Benjamin (1980 film)|Private Benjamin]]'' (1980), starring [[Goldie Hawn]].

===1980s–1990s===
Through the 1980s and 1990s, Brooks co-wrote (with longtime collaborator [[Monica Johnson]]), directed and starred in a series of well-received comedies, playing variants on his standard neurotic and self-obsessed character. These include [[1981 in film|1981's]] ''[[Modern Romance]]'', where Brooks played a film editor desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend ([[Kathryn Harrold]]). The film received a limited release and ultimately grossed under $3&nbsp;million domestically,<ref name="modgross">{{cite web | title= Modern Romance box office |publisher=boxofficemojo.com| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=modernromance.htm | accessdate=March 12, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060319105856/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=modernromance.htm| archivedate= March 19, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> but was well received by critics, with one reviewer commenting that the film was "not Brooks at his best, but still amusing".<ref name="modreviews">{{cite web | title=Modern Romance (1981) |publisher=rottentomatoes.com | work=| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/modern_romance/ | accessdate=March 12, 2006}}</ref> His best-received film, ''[[Lost in America]]'' (1985), featured Brooks and [[Julie Hagerty]] as a couple who leave their [[yuppie]] lifestyle and drop out of society to live in a motor home as they have always dreamed of doing. They meet comic disappointment.

Brooks's ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' (1991) placed his lead character in the [[afterlife]], put on trial to justify his human fears and thus determine his cosmic fate. Critics responded to the offbeat premise and the surprising chemistry between Brooks and [[Meryl Streep]] as his post-death love interest. His later efforts did not find large audiences, but still retained Brooks's touch as a filmmaker. He garnered positive reviews for ''[[Mother (1996 film)|Mother]]'' (1996), which starred Brooks as a middle-aged writer moving back home to resolve tensions between himself and his mother ([[Debbie Reynolds]]). [[1999 in film|1999's]] ''[[The Muse (1999 film)|The Muse]]'' featured Brooks as a down-and-out Hollywood screenwriter using the services of an authentic [[muse]] ([[Sharon Stone]]) for inspiration. In an interview with Brooks with regards to The Muse, Gavin Smith wrote, "Brooks's distinctive filmmaking style is remarkably discreet and unemphatic; he has a light, deft touch, with a classical precision and economy, shooting and cutting his scenes in smooth, seamless successions of medium shots, with clean, high-key lighting.<ref>Film Comment, Jan/Feb 1999, [http://www.filmcomment.com/article/all-the-choices-albert-brooks-interview All The Choices: Albert Brooks Interview]</ref>"

Brooks has appeared as a guest voice on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' five times during its run (always under the name ''A. Brooks''), and is described as the best guest star in the show's history by [[IGN]], particularly for his role as supervillain Hank Scorpio in the episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p5.html|title=Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances|accessdate=March 25, 2007|author=Goldman, Eric; Iverson, Dan; Zoromski, Brian|publisher=IGN| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070308101151/http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p5.html| archivedate= March 08 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Brooks also acted in other writers' and directors' films during the 1980s and 1990s. He had a cameo in the opening scene of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', playing a driver whose passenger ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) has a shocking secret. In [[James L. Brooks]]'s hit ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'' (1987), Albert Brooks was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] as an insecure, supremely ethical [[television network|network TV]] [[reporter]], who offers the rhetorical question, "Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?" He also won positive notices for his role in [[1998 in film|1998's]] ''[[Out of Sight (1998 film)|Out of Sight]]'', playing an untrustworthy banker and ex-convict.

===2000s===
Brooks received positive reviews for his portrayal of a dying retail store owner who befriends disillusioned teen [[Leelee Sobieski]] in ''[[My First Mister]]'' (2001). Brooks continued his voiceover work in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003), as the voice of "Marlin", one of the film's protagonists; ''Nemo'' is Brooks's largest grossing film to date.

In 2005, his film ''[[Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World]]'' was dropped by [[Sony Pictures]] due to their desire to change the title. [[Warner Independent Pictures]] purchased the film and gave it a limited release in January 2006; the film received mixed reviews and a low box office gross. The movie goes back to the days of Brooks's ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'', as Brooks once again plays himself, a filmmaker commissioned by the U.S. government to see what makes the Muslim people laugh, thus sending him on a tour of India and Pakistan.

In 2006 he appeared in the documentary film ''[[Wanderlust (2006 film)|Wanderlust]]'' as David Howard from "Lost in America". The documentary included many other well known people.  In 2007, he continued his long term collaboration with ''The Simpsons'' by voicing Russ Cargill, the central antagonist of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.

He has played Lenny Botwin, [[Nancy Botwin|Nancy Botwin's]] estranged father-in-law, on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] television series ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]''.<ref>Ausiello, Michael (April 14, 2008). [http://www.tvguide.com/news/Weeds-Scoop-Albert-8084.aspx "Weeds Scoop: Albert Brooks Is Nancy's 'Dad'"]. ''[[TV Guide]]''.</ref> [[St. Martin's Press]] published his first novel, ''[[2030 (novel)|2030: The Real Story of What Happens to America]]'', on May 10, 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=A Wry Eye on Problems of the Future|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/books/albert-brookss-2030-his-first-novel-review.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>

In 2011, Brooks costarred as a vicious gangster heavy and the main antagonist in the motion picture ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'', alongside [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Carey Mulligan]], a role that has been given much critical praise and positive reviews, with several critics proclaiming Brooks' performance as one of the film's best aspects. After receiving awards and nominations from several film festivals and critic groups, but not an Academy Award nomination, Brooks responded humorously on [[Twitter]], "And to the Academy: ‘You don't like me. You really don't like me’."<ref>{{cite news |date=January 24, 2012 |title=Albert Brooks not nominated for Oscar: ‘I got ROBBED ... I mean literally.

==Personal life==
In 1997, Brooks married Kimberly Shlain, then a 31-year old website designer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/22/movies/film-a-funnyman-whose-muse-is-in-the-mirror.html |work=The New York Times |date=August 22, 1999 |title=A Funnyman Whose Muse is in the Mirror |first=Margy |last=Rochlin}}</ref> Kimberly's father was surgeon and writer [[Leonard Shlain]].
