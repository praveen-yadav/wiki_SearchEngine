A '''church building''', often simply called a '''church''', is a building used for religious activities particularly worship services. The term in its architectural sense is most often used by [[Christian]]s to refer to their religious buildings but can be used by other religions. In traditional Christian architecture, the church is often arranged in the shape of a cross. When viewed from [[plan view]] the longest part of a cross is represented by the aisle and the junction of the cross is located at the altar area. Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the [[heaven]]s and inspiring church visitors. Modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use; and, similarly, many original church buildings have been put to other uses.

[[File:Church of Saint Simeon Stylites 01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites]] in [[Aleppo]], Syria is considered to be one of the oldest surviving church buildings in the world.]]
The [[Early Christianity|first Christians]] were, like [[Jesus]], Israelites resident in [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Roman Israel]] who worshiped on occasion in the [[Second Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]] and weekly in local synagogues. Temple worship was a ritual involving [[sacrifice]], occasionally including the [[Korban|sacrifice of animals]] in atonement for [[sin]], offered to the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]].
The [[New Testament]] includes many references to Jesus visiting the Temple, the first time as an infant with his parents, see [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]]. The early history of the synagogue is obscure, but it seems to be an institution developed for public Jewish worship during the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian captivity]] when the Jews (and Jewish [[Proselytes]]) did not have access to a Temple (the [[First Temple]] having been destroyed c. 586 BC) for ritual sacrifice. Instead, they developed a daily and weekly service of [[Torah reading|readings from the Torah]], and possibly also the [[Neviim|Prophets]], followed by [[Midrash|commentary]]. This could be carried out in a house if the attendance was small enough, and in many towns of the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] that was the case. In others, more elaborate architectural settings developed, sometimes by converting a house and sometimes by converting a previously public building. The minimum requirements seem to have been a meeting room with adequate seating, a case for the [[Torah scroll]], and a raised platform for the reader.

Jesus himself participated in this sort of service as a reader and commentator (see [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:16–24}}) and his followers probably remained worshipers in synagogues in some cities,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} for example the [[Cenacle]] in Jerusalem. However, following the [[Destruction of the Temple|destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD]], the new Christian movement and [[Rabbinic Judaism]] increasingly parted ways (see also [[List of events in early Christianity]]). The Church became overwhelmingly [[Gentile]] sometime in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], the era of [[Constantine I and Christianity]] and the later setting up of a [[state church of the Roman Empire]].

The [[Syria]]n city of [[Dura-Europos]] on the West bank of the [[Euphrates]] was an outpost town between the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Parthia]]n empires. During a siege by Parthian troops in AD 257, the buildings in the outermost blocks of the city grid were partially destroyed and filled with rubble to reinforce the [[city wall]]. Thus were preserved and securely dated an early decorated church and a synagogue decorated with extensive wall paintings. Both had been converted from earlier private buildings.

The [[Dura-Europos church]] from 235 AD has a special room dedicated for [[baptisms]] with a large [[baptismal font]].

==Etymology==

In [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' means "belonging, or pertaining, to a ''Kýrios''" ("Lord"), and the usage was adopted by early Christians of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord [[Jesus Christ]]: hence "''Kyriakós oíkos''" ("house of the Lord", church), "''Kyriakē''" ("[the day] of the Lord", i.e. [[Sunday]]), or "''Kyriakē proseukhē''" (the "[[Lord's prayer]]").   

In standard Greek usage, the older word "ecclesia" (ἐκκλησία, ''ekklesía'', literally "assembly", "congregation", or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a "'''''c'''''hurch"), and the overall community of the faithful (the "'''''C'''''hurch").  This usage was also retained in [[Latin]] and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French ''église'', Italian ''chiesa'', Spanish ''iglesia'', Portuguese ''igreja'', etc.), as well as in the [[Celtic languages]] (Welsh ''eglwys'', Irish ''eaglais'', Breton ''iliz'', etc.). 

In the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and some [[Slavic languages]], the word ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof.  In [[Old English]] the sequence of derivation started as "cirice" (Ki-ri-keh), then "churche" (kerke), and eventually "church" in its traditional pronunciation.  German ''Kirche'', Scottish ''kirk'', Russian ''tserkov'', etc., are all similarly derived.

==History==

===Antiquity===
The earliest identified Christian house church is the Dura-Europos church, founded between 233 and 256.

===Medieval times===
During the 11th through 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller parish churches occurred across Western Europe.  In addition to being a place of worship, the cathedral or parish church was used by the community in other ways.  It could serve as a meeting place for [[guilds]] or a hall for [[banquet]]s. [[Mystery plays]] were sometimes performed in cathedrals, and cathedrals might also be used for [[fair]]s.  The church could be used as a place to thresh and store grain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |title=Cathedrals and the Church |page=12}}</ref>

===Renaissance===

===Industrial era===
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}

===Modern era===
Throughout the last few centuries, the types of churches have become much more widespread. Some have gospel choirs while other are in total silence. The ornateness of churches varies widely depending on the religion of the deity being worshiped, or the praying culture of the community.  Due to various cultural and social reasons, most churches have seen a decline in attendance in recent years.

==Architecture==
{{main|Church architecture}}
[[File:Catholic Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|The [[St. Joseph's Cathedral, Asmara|St. Joseph's Cathedral]] in [[Asmara]], [[Eritrea]].]]
A common architecture for churches is the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]] (a long central rectangle, with side rectangles, and a rectangle in front for the [[altar]] space or sanctuary). These churches also often have a [[dome]] or other large [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] space in the interior to represent or draw attention to the heavens. Other common shapes for churches include a circle, to represent eternity, or an [[octagon]] or similar star shape, to represent the church's bringing light to the world. Another common feature is the [[spire]], a tall tower on the "west" end of the church or over the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]].

==Types==
===Basilica===
{{main|Basilica}}
The [[Latin]] word basilica (derived from [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Stoa Basileios|Basiliké Stoà]]'', Royal ''[[Stoa]]''), was originally used to describe a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] public building (as in [[Greece]], mainly a [[tribunal]]), usually located in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of a Roman town.

After the [[Roman Empire]] became [[Edict of Thessalonica|officially Christian]], the term came by extension to refer to a large and important church that has been given special ceremonial rights by the [[Pope]]. Thus the word retains two senses today, one architectural and the other ecclesiastical.

[[File:Catedral metropol.jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Brasilia]], projected by [[Oscar Niemeyer]], is an example of modern church.]]
===Cathedral===
{{main|Cathedral architecture of Western Europe}}

A cathedral is a church, usually Roman Catholic, [[Anglican]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]], housing the seat of a bishop. The word cathedral takes its name from ''[[cathedra]]'', or Bishop's Throne (In [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''ecclesia cathedralis''). The term is sometimes (improperly) used to refer to any church of great size.

A church that has the function of cathedral is not necessarily a large building. It might be as small as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]] in [[Oxford]], England, [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh, United States]], or [[Chur]] Cathedral in [[Switzerland]]. However, frequently, the cathedral along with some of the abbey churches, was the [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest building]] in any region.

===Alternative buildings===
Old and disused church buildings can be seen as an interesting proposition for developers as the architecture and location often provide for attractive homes<ref>{{cite news| url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/new_homes/article3047285.ece |work=The Times |location=London  | title=Church conversions | first=Lucy | last=Alexander | date=14 December 2007 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourproperty.co.uk/guides/buying_a_church_conversion.html |title=Buying a church conversion |publisher=OurProperty.co.uk |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> or city centre entertainment venues<ref>{{cite web|author=Site design and technology by Lightmaker.com |url=http://www.pitcherandpiano.com/locations/bar.cfm?area=Nottingham |title=quality food and drink |publisher=Pitcher and Piano |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> On the other hand, many newer Churches have decided to host meetings in public buildings such as schools,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familychurchchristchurch.org.uk |title=Welcome to the Family Church Christchurch Dorset |publisher=The Family Church Christchurch |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> universities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-hope.org.uk |title=Welcome to The Hope Church, Manchester...

There is another trend to convert old buildings for [[worship]] rather than face the construction costs and planning difficulties of a new build.  Unusual venues in the UK include an old Tram power station,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-church.co.uk |title=CITY CHURCH NEWCASTLE & GATESHEAD – enjoying God...making friends...changing lives – Welcome |publisher=City-church.co.uk |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> a former [[bus garage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aylshamcommunitychurch.org |title=Aylsham Community Church |publisher=Aylsham Community Church |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> an old cinema and [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]] hall,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Reg|year=2004|title=Things are different now: A short history of Winchester Family Church|publisher=Winchester Family Church|location=Winchester|page=11}}</ref> a former [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] Drill Hall,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnabascommunitychurch.com/barnabascentre.htm |title=Shrewsbury Venue Shrewsbury – Barnabas Community Church Shrewsbury |publisher=Barnabascommunitychurch.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> a former synagogue<ref>[http://www.citychurchsheffield.org.uk/jubileecentre.htm ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> and a [[St Cross Chapel, Reigate|windmill]].
