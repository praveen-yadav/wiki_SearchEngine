'''Cheddar''' is a large village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Sedgemoor]] district of the English county of [[Somerset]]. It is situated on the southern edge of the [[Mendip Hills]], {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} north-west of [[Wells]]. The civil parish includes the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s of Nyland and Bradley Cross. The village, which has its own parish council, has a population of 5,093 and the parish has an acreage of {{convert|8592 |acres}} as of 1961.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cheddar CP/AP through time acreage|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_AREA_ACRES&u_id=10423909&c_id=10001043&add=Y|work=A vision of Britain through time|accessdate=12 February 2011}}</ref>

[[Cheddar Gorge]], on the northern edge of the village, is the largest [[canyon|gorge]] in the United Kingdom and includes several [[show cave]]s including [[Gough's Cave]]. The gorge has been a centre of human settlement since [[Neolithic]] times, including a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] palace. It has a temperate climate and provides a unique geological and biological environment that has been recognised by the designation of several [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cheddar Gorge and Caves|url=http://www.bristol-link.co.uk/entertainment/cheddar-gorge.htm|publisher=Bristol-link | accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref> It is also the site of several [[limestone]] [[quarry|quarries]]. The village gave its name to [[Cheddar cheese]] and has been a centre for [[Garden strawberry|strawberry]] growing, with the crop being transported on the [[Cheddar Valley line]], which closed in the late 1960s but is now a cycle path. It is now a major tourist destination with several cultural and community facilities, including the Cheddar Show Caves Museum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chedder Man—Museum of Prehistory|url=http://www.cheddarcaves.co.uk/section.php?xSec=20 | accessdate=31 January 2011|publisher=Cheddar Caves}}</ref>

The village supports a variety of community groups including religious, sporting and cultural organisations. Several of these are based on the site of [[The Kings of Wessex Academy]], which is the largest educational establishment.

Cheddar, its surrounding villages and specifically the gorge has been subject to flooding.

The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the police, district council officers, and [[Neighbourhood Watch (UK)|neighbourhood watch]] groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic.

== Geography ==

[[File:Cheddar Village - Mendip Hills - Somerset - England - Project Gutenberg eText 12287.jpg|thumb|right|Cheddar Gorge c.&nbsp;1907]]

The area is underlain by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the [[Carboniferous]] [[Limestone]] Series, which contain [[Oolite|ooliths]] and [[fossil]] debris on top of [[Old Red Sandstone]], and by [[Dolomite|Dolomitic Conglomerate]] of the [[Keuper]]. Evidence for [[Variscan orogeny]] is seen in the sheared rock and cleaved shales. In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils.<ref name="sssi">{{cite web | title=The Cheddar Complex | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003940.pdf | accessdate=17 July 2006|format=PDF}}</ref>

=== Sites of Special Scientific Interest ===

[[File:Cheddarreser.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cheddar Reservoir]] at dusk, looking towards the western edge of the [[Mendip Hills]] and [[Crook Peak to Shute Shelve Hill|Crook Peak]]]]
There are several large and unique [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) around the village.

[[Cheddar Reservoir]] is a near-circular artificial reservoir operated by [[Bristol Water]]. Dating from the 1930s, it has a capacity of 135&nbsp;million&nbsp;gallons (614,000&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;metres).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/cheddar-info.asp|title=Cheddar Reservoir Introduction|publisher=Bristol Water|accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref> The reservoir is supplied with water taken from the [[Cheddar Yeo]], which rises in Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge and is a tributary of the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]].

[[Cheddar Wood]] and the smaller Macall's Wood form a [[biological Site of Special Scientific Interest]] from what remains of the wood of the [[Bishops of Bath and Wells]] in the 13th&nbsp;century and of [[Edmund I of England|King Edmund]] the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19th&nbsp;century, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make [[Garden strawberry|strawberry]] fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was [[coppice]]d until 1917.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Aspects of the medieval landscape of Somerset |last=Aston |first=Michael |authorlink=Mick Aston |coauthors= |year= 1988|publisher=[[Somerset County Council]] |location= |isbn=0-86183-129-2 |page=30 }}</ref> This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of [[calcareous grassland]] and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath.

By far the largest of the SSSIs is called [[Cheddar Complex]] and covers {{convert|441.3|ha|acre|1}} of the gorge, caves and the surrounding area. It is important because of both biological and geological features. It includes four SSSIs, formerly known as Cheddar Gorge SSSI, August Hole/Longwood Swallet SSSI, GB Cavern Charterhouse SSSI and Charterhouse on-Mendip SSSI.<ref name="cheddarcomplexsssi">{{cite web| title=The Cheddar Complex | publisher=[[English Nature]] | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003940.pdf | format= PDF| accessdate=17 July 2006}}</ref> It is partly owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] who acquired it in 1910<ref>{{cite web|title=Nature and the National Trust|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment/w-nature/w-nature-strategy.htm|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref> and partly managed by the [[Somerset Wildlife Trust]].<ref name="cheddarcomplexsssi"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Cheddar Complex|url=http://www.somersetwildlife.org/cheddar_complex.html|publisher=Somerset Wildlife Trust|accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref>

=== Climate ===

Along with the rest of [[South West England]], Cheddar has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country.<ref name="weather">{{cite web | title=South West England: climate | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ | accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref> The annual mean temperature is approximately {{convert|10|°C|°F|1}}. [[Temperateness|Seasonal temperature variation]] is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea, which moderates temperature. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately {{convert|21|°C|°F|1}}. In winter mean minimum temperatures of {{convert|1|°C|°F|1}} or {{convert|2|°C|°F|1}} are common.<ref name="weather"/> In the summer the [[Azores]] high-pressure system affects the south-west of England. [[Convective]] cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine; annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600&nbsp;hours.<ref name="weather"/> In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by [[Low-pressure area|Atlantic depressions]] or by [[convection]]. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which are most active during those seasons. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around {{convert|700|mm|abbr=on}}. About 8–15 days of snowfall per year is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.<ref name="weather"/>

[[File:Cheddar Cross.jpg|thumb|[[Photochrom]] of Cheddar Market Cross in the 1890s]]
The market cross in Bath Street dates from the 15th&nbsp;century, with the shelter having been rebuilt in 1834. It has a central octagonal pier, a socket raised on four steps, hexagonal shelter with six arched four-centred openings, shallow two-stage buttresses at each angle, an and embattled parapet. The shaft is crowned by an [[abacus]] with figures in niches, probably from the late 19th&nbsp;century, although the cross is now missing. It was rebuilt by [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath|Thomas, Marquis of Bath]]. It is a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] (Somerset County No&nbsp;21) and Grade&nbsp;II* [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Market Cross | work=[[Images of England]] | publisher=[[English Heritage]] | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=268772 | accessdate=9 May 2006}}</ref>

It was on the [[Cheddar Valley line]], a railway line that was opened in 1869 and closed in 1963. It became known as The Strawberry Line because of the large volume of locally-grown [[strawberries]] that it carried. It ran from [[Yatton railway station]] through {{stnlnk|Cheddar}} to [[Wells (Tucker Street) railway station]] and joined the [[East Somerset Railway]] to make a through route via [[Shepton Mallet (High Street) railway station]] to [[Witham (Somerset) railway station|Witham]]. Sections of the now-disused railway have been opened as the Strawberry Line Trail, which currently runs from Yatton to Cheddar. The Cheddar Valley line survived until the "[[Beeching Axe]]". Towards the end of its life there were so few passengers that diesel [[railcar]]s were sometimes used. The Cheddar branch closed to passengers on 9 September 1963 and to goods in 1964.<ref name="daniels"/> The line closed in the 1960s, when it became part of the Cheddar Valley Railway Nature Reserve,<ref name="Strawberry Line"/> and part of the [[National Cycle Network]] route&nbsp;26.
