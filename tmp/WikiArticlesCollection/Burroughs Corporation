The '''Burroughs Corporation''' was a major American manufacturer of business equipment. The company was founded in 1886 as the '''American [[Arithmometer]] Company''' and after the 1986 merger with [[Sperry Univac]] was renamed as [[Unisys]]. The company's history paralleled many of the major developments in [[history of computing|computing]]. At its start it produced mechanical [[adding machine]]s, and later moved into programmable ledgers and then computers. And while it was one of the largest producers of [[mainframe computer]]s in the world, Burroughs also produced related equipment as well, including [[typewriter]]s and [[Printer (computing)|printer]]s.

==Early history==

[[File:1890s adding machine.jpg|thumb|150px|Desktop model in use around 1910]]
In 1886, the American Arithmometer Company was established in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to produce and sell an [[adding machine]] invented by [[William Seward Burroughs I|William Seward Burroughs]] (grandfather of [[Beat Generation]] author [[William S. Burroughs]]). In 1904, six years after Burroughs' death, the company moved to Detroit and changed its name to the Burroughs Adding Machine Company. It soon was the biggest adding machine company in America.

==Evolving product lines==

The adding machine range began with the basic, hand-cranked P100 which was only capable of adding. The design included some revolutionary features, foremost of which was the "dashpot" - an oil-filled piston assembly designed to cushion the spring driven return of the main assembly.  The P200 offered a subtraction capability and the P300 provided a means of keeping 2 separate totals. The P400 and the P600, the top of the range of which was the P612 provided a moveable carriage and, in the case of the P600/P612 range some limited programmability based upon the position of the carriage. The range was further extended by the inclusion of the "J" series which provided a single finger calculation facility, and the "c" series of both manual and electrical assisted comptometers. In the late 60's the Burroughs sponsored "nixi-tube" provided an electronic display calculator.
Burroughs developed a range of adding machines with different capabilities, gradually increasing in their capabilities. A revolutionary adding machine was the ''Sensimatic'', which was able to perform many business functions semi-automatically. It had a moving programmable carriage to maintain [[general ledger|ledgers]]. It could store 9, 18 or 27 [[Trial balance|balances]] during the ledger posting operations and worked with a mechanical adder named a Crossfooter. The Sensimatic developed into the ''Sensitronic'' which could store balances on a [[magnetic stripe]] which was part of the ledger card. This balance was read into the accumulator when the card was inserted into the carriage. The Sensitronic was followed by the E1000, the E2000, E4000, E6000 and the E8000, which was computer system supporting [[magnetic tape]], card reader/punches and a [[line printer]].

In time, Burroughs was selling more than adding machines, including typewriters. But the biggest shift in company history came in 1953; the Burroughs Adding Machine Company was renamed the Burroughs Corporation and began moving into computer products, initially for banking institutions. This move began with Burrough's purchase, in June 1956, of the ElectroData Corporation in [[Pasadena, California]], a spinoff of the Consolidated Engineering Corporation which had designed test instruments and had a cooperative relationship with [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in Pasadena.<ref name="Sawyer">Sawyer, T.J., [http://tjsawyer.com/B205Home.htm "Burroughs 205 HomePage"]</ref> ElectroData had built the Datatron 205 and was working on the Datatron 220.<ref name="Sawyer"/> The first major computer product that came from this marriage was the B205 tube computer. In the late 1960s the D2000, D4000 range was produced (also known as the TC500—Terminal Computer 500) which had a [[golf ball printer]] and a 1K (80 bit) disk [[Memory (computers)|memory]]. These were popular as branch [[Computer terminal|terminal]]s to the B5500/6500/6700 systems, which sold well in the banking sector, where they were often connected to non-Burroughs mainframes. In conjunction with these products, Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of cheque processing equipment, normally attached as terminals to a larger system such as a B2700 or B1700.

==A force in the computing industry==
Burroughs was one of the eight major United States computer companies (with [[IBM]], the largest, [[Honeywell]], [[NCR Corporation]], [[Control Data Corporation]], [[General Electric]], [[RCA]] and [[UNIVAC]]) through most of the 1960s. In terms of sales, Burroughs was always a distant second to [[International Business Machines|IBM]]. In fact, IBM's share of the market at the time was so much larger than all of the others, that this group was often referred to as "IBM and the Seven Dwarfs."<ref>

publisher=Dvorak Uncensored|
author=[[John C. Dvorak|Dvorak, John C.]]|

accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref>  By 1972 when GE and RCA were no longer in the mainframe business, the remaining five companies behind IBM became known as the [[BUNCH]], an [[acronym]] based on their initials.

At the same time, Burroughs was very much a competitor. Like IBM, Burroughs tried to supply a complete line of products for its customers, including Burroughs-designed printers, [[disk drive]]s, [[tape drive]]s, computer printing paper, and even [[typewriter ribbon]]s.

In the 1950s, Burroughs worked with the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] on the development and computer processing of [[magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR) especially for the processing of bank cheques. Burroughs made special MICR/OCR sorter/readers which attached to their medium systems line of computers ([[Burroughs B2000|2700/3700/4700]]) and this entrenched the company in the computer side of the banking industry.

===Developments and innovations===
The Burroughs Corporation developed three highly innovative [[computer architecture|architectures]], based on the design philosophy of "language directed design". Their machine instruction sets favored one or many [[high level programming languages]], such as [[ALGOL]], [[COBOL]] or [[FORTRAN]]. All three architectures were considered [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] class machines:
* The [[Burroughs large systems]] machines started with the B5000 in 1961. The B5500 came a few years later when large rotating disks replaced drums as the main external memory media.  These B5000 Series systems used the world's first virtual memory multi-programming operating system.  They were followed by the B6500/B6700 in the later 1960s, the B7700 in the mid 1970s, and the A series in the 1980s. The underlying architecture of these machines is similar and continues today as the [[Unisys]] ClearPath MCP line of computers: [[stack machine]]s designed to be programmed in an extended [[Algol 60]]. Their [[operating system]]s, called MCP ([[MCP (Burroughs Large Systems)|Master Control Program]]&mdash;the name later borrowed by the screenwriters for ''[[Tron]]''), were programmed in [[Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language|ESPOL]] (Executive Systems Programming Oriented Language, a minor extension of ALGOL), and later in NEWP (with further extensions to ALGOL) almost a decade before [[Unix]]. The command interface developed into a compiled [[Structured programming|structured language]] with declarations, statements and procedures called WFL ([[Work Flow Language]]). Many [[computer scientist]]s consider these series of computers to be technologically groundbreaking. Stack oriented processors, with 48 bit word length where each word was defined as data or program contributed significantly to a secure operating environment, long before [[spyware]] and [[virus]]es affected computing. And the modularity of these large systems was also unique: multiple [[CPU]]s, multiple memory modules and multiple [[I/O]] and Data Comm processors permitted incremental and [[cost effective]] growth of system performance and reliability. In industries like banking, where continuous operations was mandatory, Burroughs large systems penetrated most every large bank, including the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. And Burroughs built the backbone [[switching systems]] for [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT) which sent its first message in 1977. Unisys is still the provider to SWIFT today.
* Burroughs produced the [[Burroughs B2500|B2500]] or "medium systems" computers aimed primarily at the business world. The machines were designed to execute [[COBOL]] efficiently. This included a BCD ([[Binary Coded Decimal]]) based arithmetic unit, storing and addressing the main memory using [[base 10]] numbering instead of [[Binary numeral system|binary]]. The designation for these systems was Burroughs B2500 through B49xx, followed by Unisys V-Series V340 through V560.
* Burroughs produced the [[Burroughs B1700|B1700]] or "small systems" computers that were designed to be [[microprogram]]med, with each process potentially getting its own [[virtual machine]] designed to be the best match to the [[programming language]] chosen for the program being run.
* The smallest general-purpose computers were the B700 "[[microprocessor]]s" which were used both as stand-alone systems and as special-purpose data-communications or disk-subsystem controllers.
* Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of [[Accounting Machine|accounting machines]] including both stand-alone systems such as the [[Burroughs Sensimatic|Sensimatic]], L500 and B80, and dedicated terminals including the TC500 and specialised check processing equipment.<ref>[http://www.picklesnet.com/burroughs/descriptions/b80.htm Burroughs B80 Family]</ref>
* In 1982, Burroughs began producing [[personal computer]]s, the B20 and B25 lines with the [[Intel 8086]]/[[Intel 8088|8088]] family of 8-bit chips as the processor.<ref>[http://www.oocities.org/siliconvalley/pines/4011/misc-doc/Intro.htm "B25 FAMILY OF UNIVERSAL WORKSTATIONS INTRODUCTION"], 1987</ref> These ran the [[Convergent Technologies Operating System|BTOS]] operating system, which Burroughs licensed from [[Convergent Technologies (Unisys)|Convergent Technologies]]. These machines implemented an early [[Local Area Network]] to share a [[hard disk]] between [[workgroup (computer networking)|workgroup]] users. These microcomputers were later manufactured in [[Kunming]], [[China]] for use in China under agreement with Burroughs.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/03/business/china-deal-for-burroughs.html "China Deal For Burroughs"], ''The New York Times'', [[Associated Press|AP]] story, January 3, 1985</ref>

* Burroughs collaborated with [[University of Illinois]] on a multiprocessor architecture developing the [[ILLIAC IV]] computer in the early 1960s. The ILLIAC had up to 128 parallel processors while the B6700 & B7700 only accommodated a total of 7 CPUs and/or IO units (the 8th unit was the memory tester).
* Burroughs made military computers, such as the D825 (the "D" prefix signifying it was for defense industrial use), in its Great Valley Laboratory in [[Paoli, Pennsylvania]].<ref>[http://www.smecc.org/burroughs_buic_-__an_gsa-51__sage_backup.htm "Burroughs BUIC - AN/GSA-51 SAGE Backup"], archived at SMECC</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1145/1461518.1461527}}</ref> The D825 was, according to some scholars, the first true multiprocessor computer.<ref>Enslow, Philip H., Jr., "Multiprocessor Organization - A Survey", Computing Surveys, Vol. 9, March 1977, pp.103–129.</ref> Paoli was also home to the Defense and Space Group Marketing Division.<ref>

* In 1964 Burroughs had also completed the D830 which was another variation of the D825 designed specifically for real-time applications, such as airline reservations. Burroughs designated it the B8300 after [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) ordered one in September 1965. A system with three instruction processors was installed at TWA's reservations center in [[Rockleigh, New Jersey]] in 1968. The system, which was called George, with an application programmed in [[JOVIAL]], was intended to support some 4000 terminals, but even after a fourth processor was added it couldn't handle the workload. TWA canceled the project in 1970, acquiring one [[IBM System/360]] Model 75, two IBM System/360 model 65s, and IBM's [[Programmed Airline Reservations System|PARS]] software for its reservations system. TWA sued Burroughs for non-fulfillment of the contract, but Burroughs counter-sued, stating that the basic system did work and that the problems were in TWA's applications software. The two companies reached an out-of-court settlement.<ref name="B3G">Gray, George, [http://wiki.cc.gatech.edu/folklore/index.php/Burroughs_Third-Generation_Computers "Burroughs Third-Generation Computers"], Unisys History Newsletter, Volume 3, Number 5, October, 1999</ref>
*  Burroughs developed a half-size version of the D825 called the D82, cutting the word size from 48 to 24 bits and simplifying the computer's instruction set. The D82 could have up to 32,768 words of core memory and continued the use of separate instruction and i/o processors. Burroughs sold a D82 to [[Air Canada]] to handle reservations for trips originating in [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec]]. This design was further refined and made much more compact as the D84 machine which was completed in 1965. A D84 processor/memory unit with 4096 words of memory occupied just 1.4 cubic feet. This system was used successfully in two military projects: field test systems used to check the electronics of the Air Force [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]] fighter plane and systems used to control the countdown and launch of the Army's [[MGM-31 Pershing|Pershing missile]].<ref name="B3G"/><ref>[http://umedia.lib.umn.edu/node/30883 "Title: Trade show exhibition featuring the D84; Date 1965"], University of Minnesota archives</ref>

==Merger==
In September 1986, Burroughs Corporation merged with [[Sperry Corporation]] to form [[Unisys]]. For a time, the combined company retained the Burroughs processors as the A- and V-systems lines. However, as the market for large systems shifted from proprietary architectures to common servers, the company eventually dropped the V-Series line, although customers continued to use V-series systems {{as of | 2010 | lc =on}}. {{As of | 2013}} Unisys continues to develop and market the A-Series, now known as ClearPath.<ref>

In 2010, UNISYS sold off its Payment Systems Division to Marlin Equity Partners, a California-based private investment firm, which incorporated it as Burroughs Payment Systems based in [[Plymouth, Michigan]].<ref>[http://www.burroughs.com/NewsEvents.aspx "Marlin Equity Partners acquires elements of Unisys payment systems"], Burroughs press release, February 3, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.burroughs.com Burroughs Payment Systems website].In 2012, the company changed its name to Burroughs, Inc. "The re-emergence of a company brand that began over 100 years ago solidifies our commitment to provide innovative solutions to your business needs.  Back then, the introduction of Burroughs adding machines simplified daily operations for thousands of corporations. Today, our focus on payment systems related technologies and services has resulted in countless efficiencies for financial institutions and businesses alike who process check and cash transactions."</ref>

Burroughs B205 hardware has appeared as props in many [[Hollywood]] television and film productions from the 1960s onwards. For example a B205 [[front panel|console]] was often shown in the television series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' as the ''Bat Computer''; also as the computer in ''[[Lost in Space]]''. B205 tape drives were often seen in series such as ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'' and ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]''.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/B205/onscreen.html "B205 On Screen"]</ref>
