The '''Bible''' <!--Per consensus, please do not add the word 'holy'-->(from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, "the books") is a canonical collection of texts considered sacred in [[Judaism]] as well as in [[Christianity]]. The term Bible is shared between the two religions, although the contents of each of their collections of canonical texts is not the same. Different religious groups include different books within their canons, in different orders, and sometimes divide or combine books, or incorporate [[Books of the Bible#Intertestamental books|additional material]] into canonical books.

The [[Hebrew Bible]], or ''[[Tanakh]]'', contains twenty-four books divided into three parts: the five books of the ''[[Torah]]'' ("teaching" or "law"), the ''[[Nevi'im]]'' ("prophets"), and the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' ("writings").

Christian Bibles range from the sixty-six books of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] canon to the eighty-one books of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] canon. The first part of [[Christian Bible]]s is the [[Old Testament]], which contains, at minimum, the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible divided into thirty-nine books and ordered differently than the Hebrew Bible. The [[Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] churches also hold certain [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical books and passages]] to be part of the [[development of the Old Testament canon|Old Testament canon]]. The second part is the [[New Testament]], containing twenty-seven books: the four [[Canonical gospels]], [[Acts of the Apostles]], twenty-one [[Epistle#New Testament epistles|Epistles]] or letters, and the [[Book of Revelation]].

By the 2nd century BCE Jewish groups had called the Bible books "holy," and Christians now commonly call the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible "The Holy Bible" ({{lang|grc|τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια}}, ''tà biblía tà ágia'') or "the Holy Scriptures" ({{lang|grc|η Αγία Γραφή}}, ''e Agía Graphḗ''). Many Christians consider the whole canonical text of the Bible to be [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]]. The oldest surviving complete Christian Bibles are Greek manuscripts from the 4th century. The oldest Tanakh manuscript in Hebrew and Aramaic dates to the 10th century CE,<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=M1rS4Kce_PMC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Memories of ancient Israel|first=Philip R.|last=Davies|page=7|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-664-23288-7}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> but an early 4th-century [[Septuagint]] translation is found in the [[Codex Vaticanus]]. The Bible was [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|divided into chapters]] in the 13th century by [[Stephen Langton]] and into verses in the 16th century by French printer [[Robert Estienne]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Where did the chapter and verse numbers of the Bible originate?|url=http://www.catholic.com/quickquestions/where-did-the-chapter-and-verse-numbers-of-the-bible-originate|publisher=CA}}</ref> and is now usually [[Citation|cited]] by book, chapter, and verse.

The Bible is widely considered to be the best selling book of all time,<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-1/best-selling-book-of-non-fiction/| title =Best selling book of non-fiction}}</ref> has estimated annual sales of 100 million copies,<ref>{{cite web|title=The battle of the books|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10311317?story_id=10311317&CFID=3289446&CFTOKEN=a87381115ea0752-5130AD65-B27C-BB00-012B3B9A581DD567}}</ref><ref name=RussellAsh>{{cite book|author=Ash, Russell|title=Top 10 of Everything 2002|year=2001|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=0-7894-8043-3}}</ref> and has been a major influence on literature and history, especially in the West where it was the first mass-printed book.

==Etymology==
[[File:Family-bible.jpg|thumb|upright|An American family Bible dating to 1859.]]
The English word ''[[:wikt:Bible|Bible]]'' is from the Latin ''biblia'', from the same word in [[Medieval Latin]] and [[Late Latin]] and ultimately from [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|τὰ βιβλία}} ''ta biblia'' "the books" (singular {{lang|grc|βιβλίον}} ''biblion'').<ref name="etymonline-bible">{{OEtymD|bible}}</ref>

[[Medieval Latin]] ''biblia'' is short for ''biblia sacra'' "holy book", while ''biblia'' in Greek and Late Latin is neuter plural (gen. ''bibliorum''). It gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun (''biblia,'' gen. ''bibliae'') in medieval Latin, and so the word was loaned as a singular into the vernaculars of Western Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02543a.htm|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher=Newadvent.org|year=1907|accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>
Latin ''biblia sacra'' "holy books" translates Greek {{lang|grc|τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια}} ''ta biblia ta hagia'', "the holy books".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2319917 Biblion, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A'' Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus].</ref>

The word {{lang|grc|βιβλίον}} itself had the literal meaning of "paper" or "scroll" and came to be used as the ordinary word for "[[book]]".
It is the diminutive of {{lang|grc|βύβλος}} ''bublos'', "Egyptian papyrus", possibly so called from the name of the [[Phoenicia]]n sea port [[Byblos]] (also known as Gebal) from whence Egyptian [[papyrus]] was exported to Greece.
The Greek ''ta biblia'' (lit. "little papyrus books")<ref name="Stagg">Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology.'' Nashville: Broadman, 1962. ISBN 0-8054-1613-7.</ref> was "an expression [[Hellenistic Jews]] used to describe their sacred books (the [[Septuagint]]).<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/first/scriptures.html "From Hebrew Bible to Christian Bible" by Mark Hamilton] on PBS's site [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/ From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians].</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Bible Dictionary.com etymology of the word "Bible"].</ref> Christian use of the term can be traced to ca. 223 CE.<ref name="etymonline-bible" /> The biblical scholar [[F.F. Bruce]] notes that [[Chrysostom]] appears to be the first writer (in his ''Homilies on Matthew'', delivered between 386 and 388) to use the Greek phrase ''ta biblia'' ("the books") to describe both the Old and New Testaments together.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Frederick|authorlink=F.

==Hebrew Bible==
{{Main|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}
[[File:2nd century Hebrew decalogue.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Nash Papyrus]] (2nd century BCE) contains a portion of a pre-Masoretic Text, specifically the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Shema Yisrael]] prayer.]]
The [[Masoretic Text]] is the authoritative [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] text of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. While the Masoretic Text defines the [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|books of the Jewish canon]], it also defines the precise letter-text of these biblical books, with their [[niqqud|vocalization]] and [[cantillation|accentuation]].

The oldest extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century CE,<ref>A 7th century fragment containing the Song of the Sea (Exodus 13:19-16:1) is one of the few surviving texts from the "silent era" of Hebrew biblical texts between the Dead Sea Scrolls and the [[Aleppo Codex]]. See [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178708654713&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "Rare scroll fragment to be unveiled," Jerusalem Post, May 21, 2007].</ref> and the [[Aleppo Codex]] (once the oldest complete copy of the Masoretic Text, but now missing its [[Torah]] section) dates from the 10th century.

[[Tanakh]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|תנ"ך}}) reflects the threefold division of the Hebrew Scriptures, [[Torah]] ("Teaching"), [[Nevi'im]] ("Prophets") and [[Ketuvim]] ("Writings").

===Torah===
{{Main|Torah}}
{{See also|Oral Torah}}
The Torah (תּוֹרָה) is also known as the "Five Books of [[Moses]]" or the [[Pentateuch]], meaning "five scroll-cases".<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=CakJchHfN1QC&pg=PA647&lpg=PA647&dq=Pentateuch+from+Greek+meaning+%22five+scroll-cases&source=bl&ots=iUzv6_UPBw&sig=itoLPZH_dUSbPWww1gnM1PJfk3Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BmZoUNa6IZS08ATC1oGIBw&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Pentateuch%20from%20Greek%20meaning%20%22five%20scroll-cases&f=false] The Restored New Testament: A New Translation with Commentary, Including the Gnostic Gospels Thomas, Mary, and Judas by [[Willis Barnstone]] - W. W. Norton & Company - page 647</ref> The Hebrew names of the books are derived from the [[Incipit|first words]] in the respective texts.

The Torah comprises the following five books:
* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], ''Bereshith'' (בראשית)
* [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], ''Shemot'' (שמות)
* [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], ''Vayikra'' (ויקרא)
* [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], ''Bamidbar'' (במדבר)
* [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]], ''Devarim'' (דברים)

The first eleven chapters of Genesis provide accounts of the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] (or ordering) of the world and the history of God's early relationship with humanity. The remaining thirty-nine chapters of Genesis provide an account of God's [[Biblical covenant|covenant]] with the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Biblical patriarchs]] [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]] (also called [[Israel]]) and Jacob's children, the "[[Children of Israel]]", especially [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]. It tells of how God commanded Abraham to leave his family and home in the city of [[Ur]], eventually to settle in the land of [[Canaan]], and how the Children of Israel later moved to Egypt. The remaining four books of the Torah tell the story of [[Moses]], who lived hundreds of years after the patriarchs. He leads the Children of Israel from slavery in [[Ancient Egypt]] to the renewal of their covenant with God at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation was ready to enter the land of Canaan. The Torah ends with the death of Moses.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=AzZlANCOIRgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Seymour+Rossel%22&source=bl&ots=H0fv2a4pWG&sig=NQIme41Zh-HHQP6XRxIoeYletNE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZddoUKjaLY-o8QT2zYCgDg&ved=0CDYQuwUwATgK#v=onepage&q&f=false] The Torah: Portion by Portion By [[Seymour Rossel]] - Torah Aura Productions, 2007, p. 355</ref>

The Torah contains the commandments of God, revealed at Mount Sinai (although there is some debate among traditional scholars as to whether these were all written down at one time, or over a period of time during the 40 years of the wanderings in the desert, while several modern Jewish movements reject the idea of a literal revelation, and critical scholars believe that many of these laws developed later in Jewish history).<ref>[[Mordecai Kaplan]] 1934 ''Judaism as a Civilization'' MacMillan Press</ref><ref>[[Elliot N. Dorff]] 1979 ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=diqTpD-UbW0C&lpg=PA98&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=false Conservative Judaism: Our Ancestors to Our Descendants]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}''.

Tradition states that there are [[613 commandments]] (''taryag mitzvot'').

===Nevi'im===
{{Main|Nevi'im}}
{{Books of Nevi'im}}
''Nevi'im'' ({{lang-he|נְבִיאִים ''Nəḇî'îm''}}, "Prophets") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the ''Torah'' and ''Ketuvim''. It contains two sub-groups, the Former Prophets ({{lang|he|''Nevi'im Rishonim'' נביאים ראשונים}}, the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Latter Prophets ({{lang|he|''Nevi'im Aharonim'' נביאים אחרונים}}, the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]]).

The Nevi'im tell the story of the rise of the Hebrew monarchy and its division into two kingdoms, [[ancient Israel and Judah]], focusing on conflicts between the Israelites and other nations, and conflicts among Israelites, specifically, struggles between believers in "the {{LORD}} God"<ref>{{bibleref2|1Kings.18:24;1Kings.18:37–39|9}}</ref> and believers in foreign gods,<ref>George Savran "I and II Kings" in ''The Literary Guide to the Bible'' edited by [[Robert Alter]] and [[Frank Kermode]]. "Each king is judged either good or bad in black-and-white terms, according to whether or not he "did right" or "did evil" in the sight of the Lord. This evaluation is not reflective of the well-being of the nation, of the king's success or failure in war, or of the moral climate of the times, but rather the state of cultic worship during his reign. Those kings who shun idolatry and enact religious reforms are singled out for praise, and those who encourage pagan practices are denounced." 146</ref><ref>[[Yehezkel Kaufmann]] "Israel In Canaan" in ''Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People'' edited by Leo Schwartz, The Modern Library. "The fight against Baal was initiated by the prophets" 54</ref> and the criticism of unethical and unjust behavior of Israelite elites and rulers;<ref>[[Yehezkel Kaufmann]] "The Age of Prophecy" in ''Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People'' edited by Leo Schwartz, The Modern Library. "The immediate occasion of the rise of the new prophecy was the political and social ruin caused by the wars with Israel's northerly neighbor, Aram, which continued for more than a century. They raged intensely during the reign of Ahab, and did not end until the time of Jeroboam II (784–744). While the nation as a whole was impoverished, a few&nbsp;– apparently of the royal officialdom&nbsp;– grew wealthy as a result of the national calamity. Many of the people were compelled to sell their houses and lands, with the result that a sharp social cleavage arose: on the one hand a mass of propertyless indigents, on the other a small circle of the rich. A series of disasters struck the nation&nbsp;– drought, famine, plagues, death and captivity (Amos 4: 6–11), but the greatest disaster of all was the social disintegration due to the cleavage between the poor masses and the wealthy, dissolute upper class. The decay affected both Judah and Israel ... High minded men were appalled at this development. Was this the people whom YHWH had brought out of Egypt, to whom He had given the land and a law of justice and right? it seemed as if the land was about to be inherited by the rich, who would squander its substance in drunken revelry. it was this dissolution that brought the prophetic denunciations to white heat." 57-58</ref><ref>[[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] 1955 ''The Prophets'' Harper and Row: "What manner of man is the prophet? A student of philosophy who runs from the discourses of the great metaphysicians to the orations of the prophets may feel as if he were going from the realm of the sublime to an area of trivialities. Instead of dealing with the timeless issues of being and becoming, of matter and form, of definitions and demonstrations, he is thrown into orations about widows and orphans, about the corruption of judges and affairs of the market place. Instead of showing us a way through the elegant mansions of the mind, the prophets take us to the slums. The world is a proud place, full of beauty, but the prophets are scandalized, and rave as if the whole world were a slum. They make much ado about paltry things, lavishing excessive language upon trifling subjects. What if somewhere in ancient Palestine poor people have not been treated properly by the rich? .... Indeed, the sorts of crimes and even the amount of delinquency that fill the prophets of Israel with dismay do not go beyond that which we regard as normal, as typical ingredients of social dynamics. To us a single act of injustice&nbsp;– cheating in business, exploitation of the poor – is slight; to the prophets, a disaster. To us an injustice is injurious to the welfare of the people; to the prophets it is a deathblow to existence; to us an episode; to them, a catastrophe, a threat to the world." 3–4</ref><ref>Joel Rosenberg "I and II Samuel" in ''The Literary Guide to the Bible'' edited by [[Robert Alter]] and [[Frank Kermode]]. "Samuel is thus a work of national self-criticism. It recognizes that Israel would not have survived, either politically or culturally, without the steadying presence of a dynastic royal house. But it makes both that house and its subjects answerable to firm standards of prophetic justice&nbsp;— not those of cult prophets or professional ecstatics, but of morally upright prophetic leaders in the tradition of Moses, Joshua, Deborah, Gideon, and others ..." 141</ref> in which prophets played a crucial and leading role. It ends with the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians followed by the conquest of the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.

====Former Prophets====
The Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. They contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the [[Promised Land]], and end with the release from imprisonment of the last [[king of Judah]]. Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:
* Joshua's conquest of the land of Canaan (in the [[Book of Joshua]]),
* the struggle of the people to possess the land (in the [[Book of Judges]]),
* the people's request to God to give them a king so that they can occupy the land in the face of their enemies (in the books of 1st & 2nd [[Samuel]])
* the possession of the land under the divinely appointed kings of the House of David, ending in conquest and foreign exile (1st and 2nd Kings)

=====Joshua=====
The [[Book of Joshua]] (''Yehoshua'' יהושע) contains a history of the [[Israelites]] from the death of [[Moses]] to that of [[Joshua]]. After Moses' death, Joshua, by virtue of his previous appointment as Moses' successor, receives from God the command to cross the [[Jordan River]].

The book consists of three parts:
* the history of the conquest of the land (1–12).
* allotment of the land to the different tribes, with the appointment of cities of refuge, the provision for the [[Levites]] (13–22), and the dismissal of the eastern tribes to their homes.
* the farewell addresses of Joshua, with an account of his death (23, 24).

=====Judges=====
The [[Book of Judges]] (''Shoftim'' שופטים) consists of three distinct parts:
* the introduction (1:1–3:10 and 3:12) giving a summary of the book of Joshua
* the main text (3:11–16:31), discussing the five Great Judges, [[Abimelech]], and providing glosses for a few minor Judges
* appendices (17:1–21:25), giving two stories set in the time of the Judges, but not discussing the Judges themselves.

=====Samuel=====
The [[Books of Samuel]] (''Shmu'el'' שמואל) consists of five parts:
* the period of [[God]]'s rejection of [[Eli (Biblical priest)|Eli]], [[Samuel (biblical figure)|Samuel's]] birth, and subsequent judgment (1 Samuel 1:1–7:17)
* the life of [[Saul]] prior to meeting [[David]] (1 Samuel 8:1–15:35)
* Saul's interaction with David (1 Samuel 16:1–2 Samuel 1:27)
* David's reign and the rebellions he suffers (2 Samuel 2:1–20:22)
* an appendix of material concerning David in no particular order, and out of sequence with the rest of the text (2 Samuel 22:1–24:25)

A conclusion of sorts appears at [[1 Kings]] 1-2, concerning [[Solomon]] enacting a final revenge on those who did what David perceived as wrongdoing, and having a similar narrative style. While the subject matter in the Book(s) of Samuel is also covered by the narrative in [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]], it is noticeable that the section (2 Sam. 11:2-12:29) containing an account of the matter of [[Bathsheba]] is omitted in the corresponding passage in 1 Chr. 20.

=====Kings=====
The [[Books of Kings]] (''Melakhim'' מלכים) contains accounts of the kings of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]], and the [[annal]]s of the Jewish commonwealth from the accession of Solomon until the subjugation of the kingdom by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] and the [[Babylonians]].

====Latter Prophets====
The Latter Prophets are divided into two groups, the "major" prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets, collected into a single book.

=====Isaiah=====
The 66 chapters of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] (''Yeshayahu'' [ישעיהו]) consist primarily of prophecies of the judgments awaiting nations that are persecuting Judah. These nations include [[Babylon]], [[Assyria]], [[Philistia]], [[Moab]], [[Syria]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] (the northern kingdom), [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]], [[Arabia]], and [[Phoenicia]]. The prophecies concerning them can be summarized as saying that [[Jehovah]] is the God of the whole earth, and that nations which think of themselves as secure in their own power might well be conquered by other nations, at God's command.

Chapter 6 describes Isaiah's call to be a prophet of God. Chapters 35–39 provide material about King [[Hezekiah]]. Chapters 24–34, while too complex to characterize easily, are primarily concerned with prophecies of a [[messiah]], the Lord's "chosen one", a person anointed or given power by God, and of the messiah's kingdom, where justice and righteousness will reign. This section is seen by Jews as describing an king, a descendant of their great king, David, who will make Judah a great kingdom and [[Jerusalem]] a truly holy city.

The prophecy continues with what can be characterized as a "book of comfort"<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=VeOwyTae71cC&pg=PA328&lpg=PA328&dq=the+book+of+comfort+isaiah&source=bl&ots=VOmO772O7q&sig=0bohL7s3-xxgidnD16IThNl0vKo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8eZqUPWpM-WC2wXH4oEg&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=the%20book%20of%20comfort%20isaiah&f=false] ''Ancient Israelite And Early Jewish Literature'', [[Theodoor Christiaan Vriezen]] and [[A. S. Van Der Woude]] - Brill, 2005, p. 328</ref> which begins in chapter 40 and completes the writing. In the first eight chapters of this book of comfort, Isaiah prophesies the deliverance of the [[Jew]]s from the hands of the Babylonians and restoration of Israel as a unified nation in the land promised to them by God. Isaiah reaffirms that the Jews are indeed the [[chosen people]] of God in chapter 44 and that Jehovah is the only God for the Jews as he will show his power over the gods of Babylon in due time in chapter 46. In chapter 45:1 the Persian ruler [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] is named as the [[messiah]] who will overthrow the Babylonians and allow the return of Israel to their original land. The remaining chapters of the book contain prophecies of the future glory of [[Zion]] under the rule of a righteous servant (52 and 54). Chapter 53 contains a poetic prophecy about this servant which is generally considered by [[Christians]] to refer to [[Jesus]], although Jews generally interpret it as a reference to God's people. Although there is still the mention of judgment of false worshippers and idolaters (65 & 66), the book ends with a message of hope of a righteous ruler who extends salvation to his righteous subjects living in the Lord's kingdom on earth.

=====Jeremiah=====
The [[Book of Jeremiah]] (''Yirmiyahu'' [ירמיהו]) can be divided into twenty-three subsections, and its contents organized into five sub-sections:
* the introduction, ch. 1
* scorn for the sins of Israel, consisting of seven sections, (1.) ch. 2; (2.) ch. 3–6; (3.) ch. 7–10; (4.) ch. 11–13; (5.) ch. 14–17:18; (6.) ch. 17:19–ch. 20; (7.) ch. 21–24
* a general review of all nations, foreseeing their destruction, in two sections, (1.) ch. 46–49; (2.) ch. 25; with an historical appendix of three sections, (1.) ch. 26; (2.) ch. 27; (3.) ch. 28, 29
* two sections picturing the hopes of better times, (1.) ch. 30, 31; (2.) ch. 32, 33; to which is added an historical appendix in three sections, (1.) ch. 34:1–7; (2.) ch. 34:8–22; (3.) ch. 35
# the conclusion, in two sections, (1.) ch. 36; (2.) ch. 45.

In Egypt, after an interval, [[Jeremiah]] is supposed to have added three sections, viz., ch. 37–39; 40–43; and 44. The principal messianic prophecies are found in 23:1–8; 31:31–40; and 33:14–26.

Jeremiah's prophecies are noted for the frequent repetitions found in them of the same words, phrases, and imagery. They cover the period of about 30 years. They are not in chronological order.

=====Ezekiel=====
The [[Book of Ezekiel]] (''Yehezq'el'' [יחזקאל]) contains three distinct sections.
* the Judgment on Israel – Ezekiel makes a series of denunciations against his fellow Judeans ( [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%203:22-24;&version=49; 3:22–24]), warning them of the certain destruction of Jerusalem, in opposition to the words of the false prophets ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%204:1-3;&version=49; 4:1–3]). The symbolic acts, by which the extremities to which Jerusalem would be reduced are described in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%204-5;&version=49; Chapters 4 and 5], show his intimate acquaintance with the levitical legislation.

* [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]], ''Malakhi'' (מלאכי)

===Ketuvim===
{{Main|Ketuvim}}
{{Books of Ketuvim}}
''Ketuvim'' or ''Kəṯûḇîm'' (in {{lang-hbo|כְּתוּבִים}} "writings") is the third and final section of the Tanakh. The Ketuvim are believed to have been written under the [[Ruach HaKodesh]] (the Holy Spirit) but with one level less authority than that of [[prophecy]].<ref>[[Jacob Neusner|Neusner, Jacob]], The Talmud Law, Theology, Narrative: A Sourcebook. University Press of America, 2005</ref>

====The poetic books====
In [[Masoretic]] manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel stitches in the verses, which are a function of their [[Biblical poetry|poetry]]. Collectively, these three books are known as ''Sifrei Emet'' (an acronym of the titles in Hebrew, איוב, משלי, תהלים yields ''Emet'' אמ"ת, which is also the Hebrew for "[[truth]]").

These three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of [[cantillation]] notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.

====The five scrolls (''Hamesh Megillot'')====
The five relatively short books of [[Song of Songs]], [[Book of Ruth]], the [[Book of Lamentations]], [[Ecclesiastes]] and [[Book of Esther]] are collectively known as the ''Hamesh Megillot'' ([[Five Megillot]]). These are the latest books collected and designated as "authoritative" in the Jewish canon even though they were not complete until the 2nd century CE.<ref>Coogan, Michael D. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: the Hebrew Bible in its Context''. Oxford University Press. 2009; p. 5</ref>

====Other books====
Besides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics:
* Their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e., the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion).
* The Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them.
* Two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in Tanakh with significant portions in [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]].

====Order of the books====
The following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of ''Sifrei Emet'' and ''Hamesh Megillot''.

The Three Poetic Books (''Sifrei Emet'')
* ''Tehillim'' ([[Psalms]]) תְהִלִּים
* ''Mishlei'' ([[Book of Proverbs]]) מִשְלֵי
* ''Iyyôbh'' ([[Book of Job]]) אִיּוֹב
The [[Five Megillot]] (''Hamesh Megillot'')
* ''Shīr Hashshīrīm'' ([[Song of Songs]]) or (Song of Solomon) שִׁיר הַשׁשִׁירִים ([[Passover]])
* ''Rūth'' ([[Book of Ruth]]) רוּת ([[Shābhû‘ôth]])
* ''Eikhah'' ([[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]]) איכה ([[Ninth of Av]]) [Also called ''Kinnot'' in Hebrew.]
* ''Qōheleth'' ([[Ecclesiastes]]) קהלת ([[Sukkôth]])
* ''Estēr'' ([[Book of Esther]]) אֶסְתֵר ([[Pûrîm]])
Other books
* ''Dānî’ēl'' ([[Book of Daniel]]) דָּנִיֵּאל
* ''‘Ezrā'' ([[Book of Ezra]]-[[Book of Nehemiah]]) עזרא
* ''Divrei ha-Yamim'' ([[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]]) דברי הימים

The Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in Ketuvim. The [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Bava Batra]] 14b-15a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=9NUejG2IGPMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false] The Babylonian Talmud, Vol. 7 of 9: Tract Baba Bathra (Last Gate) translated by Michael L. Rodkinson, first published 1918 - published 2008 by Forgotten Books, p. 53</ref>

In Tiberian [[Masoretic]] codices, including the [[Aleppo Codex]] and the [[Leningrad Codex]], and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Esther, Daniel, Ezra.<ref>[http://www.beitemet.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10:ketuvim&catid=39:about-the-bible&Itemid=57&fontstyle=f-smaller] Ketuvim כְּתוּבִים 30 July 2008</ref>

====Canonization====
The Ketuvim is the last of the three portions of the Tanakh to have been accepted as [[biblical canon]]. While the Torah may have been considered canon by Israel as early as the 5th century BCE and the [[Former Prophets|Former]] and [[Latter Prophets]] were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century of the [[Common Era]].<ref>[[Michael Coogan|Coogan, Michael]]. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 5</ref>

Evidence suggests, however, that the people of Israel were adding what would become the Ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets. As early as 132 BCE references suggest that the Ketuvim was starting to take shape, although it lacked a formal title.<ref>Henshaw, T. ''The Writings: The Third Division of the Old Testament Canon''. George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1963, pp. 16–17</ref> References in the four [[Gospels]] as well as other books of [[the New Testament]] that many of these texts were both commonly known and counted as having some degree of religious authority early in the 1st century CE.

Many scholars believe that the limits of the Ketuvim as canonized scripture were determined by the [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 90 CE. ''[[Against Apion]]'', the writing of [[Flavius Josephus|Josephus]] in 95 CE, treated the text of the Hebrew Bible as a closed canon to which "... no one has ventured either to add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable..."<ref>Lightfoot, Neil R. ''How We Got the Bible'', 3rd edition, rev. and expanded. Baker Book House Company. 2003, pp. 154–155.</ref> For a long time following this date the divine inspiration of Esther, [[the Song of Songs]], and [[Ecclesiastes]] was often under scrutiny.<ref>Henshaw, T. ''The Writings: The Third Division of the Old Testament Canon''. George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1963, p. 17</ref>

===Original languages===
The Tanakh was mainly written in [[biblical Hebrew]], with some portions ({{Bibleref2|Ezra|4:8–6:18}} and {{Bibleref2-nb|Ezra|7:12–26}}, {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|10:11}}, {{Bibleref2|Daniel|2:4–7:28}}) in [[biblical Aramaic]], a sister language which became the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Semitic world.<ref name="Driver">Sir Godfrey Driver. "Introduction to the Old Testament of the New English Bible." Web: 30 November 2009</ref>

==Septuagint==
{{main|Septuagint}}
{{Scriptures}}
The Septuagint, or LXX, is a translation of the Hebrew scriptures and some related texts into [[Koine Greek]], begun in the late 3rd century BCE and completed by 132&nbsp;BCE,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=owd9zig7i1oC&pg=PA369 ''Life after death: a history of the afterlife in the religions of the West'' (2004)], Anchor Bible Reference Library, [[Alan F. Segal]], p. 363</ref><ref>Gilles Dorival, Marguerite Harl, and Olivier Munnich, ''La Bible grecque des Septante: Du judaïsme hellénistique au christianisme ancien'' (Paris: Cerfs, 1988), p.111</ref><ref name="ndq" /> initially in [[Alexandria]], but in time elsewhere as well.<ref name="Jobes and Silva">{{cite book|author=[[Karen H. Jobes]] and [[Moises Silva]]|title=Invitation to the Septuagint|year=2001|publisher=[[Paternoster Press]]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OysSAQAAIAAJ&q|isbn=1-84227-061-3}}</ref> It is not altogether clear which was translated when, or where; some may even have been translated twice, into different versions, and then revised.<ref>Joel Kalvesmaki, [http://www.kalvesmaki.com/LXX/ The Septuagint]</ref>

As the work of translation progressed the canon of the Greek Bible expanded. The Torah always maintained its pre-eminence as the basis of the canon but the collection of prophetic writings, based on the ''Nevi'im'', had various [[hagiographa|hagiographical]] works incorporated into it. In addition, some newer books were included in the Septuagint, among these are the [[Books of the Maccabees|Maccabees]] and the [[Ben Sira|Wisdom of Ben Sira]]. The Septuagint version of some Biblical books, like [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Esther|Esther]], are longer than those in the Jewish canon.<ref>Rick Grant Jones, ''Various Religious Topics,'' "[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pines/7224/Rick/Septuagint/sp_books.html&date=2009-10-25+07:45:33 Books of the Septuagint]," (Accessed 2006.9.5).</ref> Some of these [[apocrypha]]l books (e.g. the [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]], and the [[2 Maccabees|second book of Maccabees]]) were not translated, but composed directly in Greek.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Since [[Late Antiquity]], once attributed to a hypothetical late 1st-century [[Council of Jamnia#Developments attributed to Jamnia|Council of Jamnia]], mainstream [[Rabbinic Judaism]] rejected the Septuagint as valid Jewish scriptural texts. Several reasons have been given for this. First, some mistranslations were claimed. Second, the Hebrew source texts used for the Septuagint differed from the Masoretic tradition of Hebrew texts, which was chosen as canonical by the Jewish rabbis.<ref>"The translation, which shows at times a peculiar ignorance of Hebrew usage, was evidently made from a codex which differed widely in places from the text crystallized by the Masorah." {{cite web|title=Bible Translations - The Septuagint|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3269-bible-translations|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> Third, the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of Christianity.<ref name="ndq">"[...] die griechische Bibelübersetzung, die einem innerjüdischen Bedürfnis entsprang [...] [von den] Rabbinen zuerst gerühmt (..) Später jedoch, als manche ungenaue Übertragung des hebräischen Textes in der Septuaginta und Übersetzungsfehler die Grundlage für hellenistische Irrlehren abgaben, lehte man die Septuaginta ab." Verband der Deutschen Juden (Hrsg.), neu hrsg. von Walter Homolka, Walter Jacob, Tovia Ben Chorin: Die Lehren des Judentums nach den Quellen; München, Knesebeck, 1999, Bd.3, S. 43ff</ref><ref>"Two things, however, rendered the Septuagint unwelcome in the long run to the Jews. Its divergence from the accepted text (afterward called the Masoretic) was too evident; and it therefore could not serve as a basis for theological discussion or for homiletic interpretation. This distrust was accentuated by the fact that it had been adopted as Sacred Scripture by the new faith [Christianity] [...] In course of time it came to be the canonical Greek Bible [...] It became part of the Bible of the Christian Church."{{cite web|title=Bible Translations - The Septuagint|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3269-bible-translations|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref>
Finally, the rabbis claimed for the Hebrew language a divine authority, in contrast to Aramaic or Greek - even though these languages were the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Jews during this period (and Aramaic would eventually be given the same holy language status as Hebrew).<ref>Mishnah Sotah (7:2–4 and 8:1), among many others, discusses the sacredness of Hebrew, as opposed to Aramaic or Greek. This is comparable to the authority claimed for the original Arabic Koran according to Islamic teaching. As a result of this teaching, translations of the Torah into Koine Greek by early Jewish [[Rabbi]]s have survived as rare fragments only.</ref>

The Septuagint is the basis for the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]], [[Old Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]], [[Syro-hexaplar version|Syriac]], Old [[Armenian language|Armenian]], Old [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] versions of the Christian [[Old Testament]].<ref name="Würthwein">Ernst Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament,'' trans. Errol F. Rhodes, Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. Eerdmans, 1995.</ref> The [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches use most of the books of the Septuagint, while [[Protestant]] churches usually do not. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], many Protestant Bibles began to follow the Jewish canon and exclude the additional texts, which came to be called [[Biblical apocrypha]]. The Apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version]] of the Bible, the basis for the [[Revised Standard Version]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/|title=NETS: Electronic Edition|publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu|date=2011-02-11|accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>

===Incorporations from Theodotion===
In most ancient copies of the Bible which contain the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, the [[Book of Daniel]] is not the original Septuagint version, but instead is a copy of [[Theodotion]]'s translation from the Hebrew, which more closely resembles the Masoretic text. The Septuagint version was discarded in favour of Theodotion's version in the 2nd to 3rd centuries CE. In Greek-speaking areas, this happened near the end of the 2nd century, and in Latin-speaking areas (at least in North Africa), it occurred in the middle of the 3rd century. History does not record the reason for this, and St. [[Jerome]] reports, in the preface to the [[Vulgate]] version of Daniel, "This thing 'just' happened."<ref name="EncBibTV">{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=TEXT AND VERSIONS|section=Text and Versions}}</ref> One of two Old Greek texts of the Book of Daniel has been recently rediscovered and work is ongoing in reconstructing the original form of the book.<ref name="Dines">Jennifer M. Dines, ''The Septuagint,'' Michael A. Knibb, Ed., London: T&T Clark, 2004.</ref>

The canonical [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] is known in the Septuagint as "Esdras B", and 1 Esdras is "Esdras A". 1 Esdras is a very similar text to the books of Ezra-Nehemiah, and the two are widely thought by scholars to be derived from the same original text. It has been proposed, and is thought highly likely by scholars, that "Esdras B" – the canonical Ezra-Nehemiah – is Theodotion's version of this material, and "Esdras A" is the version which was previously in the Septuagint on its own.<ref name="EncBibTV"/>

===Final form===
Some texts are found in the Septuagint but are not present in the Hebrew. These additional books are [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], [[Judith]], [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]], [[Sirach|Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach]], [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]], [[Letter of Jeremiah]] (which later became chapter 6 of Baruch in the Vulgate), [[additions to Daniel]] ([[The Prayer of Azariah|The Prayer of Azarias]], the [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children|Song of the Three Children]], [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] and [[Bel and the Dragon]]), additions to [[Book of Esther|Esther]], [[1 Maccabees]], [[2 Maccabees]], [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]], [[1 Esdras]], [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Odes]], including the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], the [[Psalms of Solomon]], and [[Psalm 151]].

Some books that are set apart in the Masoretic text are grouped together. For example the [[Books of Samuel]] and the [[Books of Kings]] are in the LXX one book in four parts called Βασιλειῶν ("Of Reigns"). In LXX, the [[Books of Chronicles]] supplement Reigns and it is called ''Paralipomenon'' (Παραλειπομένων—things left out). The Septuagint organizes the [[minor prophets]] as twelve parts of one Book of Twelve.<ref name="Dines"/>

{{Main|Christian biblical canons|List of English Bible translations}}
[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|right|The Bible translated into German by [[Martin Luther]]]]
A Christian Bible is a set of books that a [[Christian denomination]] regards as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]] and thus constituting [[Religious text|scripture]]. Although the [[Early Christianity|Early Church]] primarily used the Septuagint or the [[Targum]]s among [[Aramaic]] speakers, the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] did not leave a defined set of new scriptures; instead the canon of the New Testament [[Development of the New Testament canon|developed over time]]. Groups within Christianity include differing books as part of their sacred writings, most prominent among which are the biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical books.

Significant versions of the English Christian Bible include the [[Douay-Rheims Bible]], the [[Revised Standard Version]], the [[Authorized King James Version]], the [[American Standard Version]], the [[English Standard Version]], the [[New King James Version]], and the [[New International Version]].

===Old Testament===
{{Main|Old Testament}}
The books which make up the Christian Old Testament differ between the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestants churches, with the Protestant movement accepting only those books contained in the Hebrew Bible, while Catholics and Orthodox have wider canons. A few groups consider particular translations to be divinely inspired, notably the Greek Septuagint, the Aramaic [[Peshitta]], and the English King James Version.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

====Apocryphal or deuterocanonical books====
In [[Eastern Christianity]], translations based on the Septuagint still prevail. The Septuagint was generally abandoned in favour of the 10th-century Masoretic Text as the basis for translations of the Old Testament into [[Western world|Western]] languages.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Some modern Western translations since the [[Wycliffe's Bible|14th century]] make use of the Septuagint to clarify passages in the Masoretic Text, where the Septuagint may preserve a variant reading of the Hebrew text.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} They also sometimes adopt variants that appear in other texts, e.g., those discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].<ref>[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-versions-and-translations/the-masoretic-text-and-the-dead-sea-scrolls/ The Masoretic Text and the Dead Sea Scrolls] - ''biblicalarchaeology.org''.

A number of books which are part of the [[Syriac versions of the Bible|Peshitta]] or Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew (Rabbinic) Bible (i.e., among the protocanonical books) are often referred to as deuterocanonical books by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e., deutero) canon, that canon as fixed definitively by the [[Council of Trent]] 1545–1563.<ref>[http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Council of Trent: ''Decretum de Canonicis Scripturis'' "Decree Concerning the Canonical Scriptures"], from the Council's fourth session, of 4 April 1546: Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, The Fourth Session, ''Celebrated on the eighth day of the month of April, in the year 1546'', English translation by James Waterworth (London 1848).</ref><ref>The Council of Trent confirmed the identical list/canon of sacred scriptures already anciently approved by the [[Synod of Hippo]] (Synod of 393), [[Councils of Carthage]] (The Council of Carthage, 28 August 397), and [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum17.htm Council of Florence (originally Council of Basel), Session 11, 4 February 1442]&nbsp;—[Bull of union with the Copts] ''seventh paragraph down''.</ref> It includes 46 books for the Old Testament (45 if Jeremiah and Lamentations are counted as one) and 27 for the New.<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition'', '''n. 120'''. —''Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition'', Latin text copyright © 1994, 1997 Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Citta del Vaticano.

Most Protestants term these books as apocrypha. Modern [[Protestantism|Protestant]] traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles included them in Apocrypha sections until the 1820s. However, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.

The Roman Catholic Church recognizes:<ref>[[Canon of Trent#List|Canon of Trent: List of the Canonical Scriptures]].

==== Pseudepigraphal texts ====

{{Main|Pseudepigrapha}}

The term Pseudepigrapha commonly describes numerous works of Jewish religious literature written from about 300 BCE to 300 CE. Not all of these works are actually pseudepigraphical. It also refers to books of the New Testament canon whose authorship is misrepresented. The "Old Testament" Pseudepigraphal works include the following:<ref name ="Harris">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible''. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.</ref>

* [[3 Maccabees]]
* [[4 Maccabees]]
* [[Assumption of Moses]]
* Ethiopic [[Book of Enoch]] (1 Enoch)
* Slavonic [[Second Book of Enoch|Book of Enoch]] (2 Enoch)
* [[Book of Jubilees]]
* [[Greek Apocalypse of Baruch]] (3 Baruch)
* [[Letter of Aristeas]]
* [[Life of Adam and Eve]]
* [[Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah]]
* [[Psalms of Solomon]]
* [[Sibylline Oracles]]
* [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch]] (2 Baruch)
* [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]

===== Book of Enoch =====

Notable pseudepigraphal works include the Books of Enoch (such as 1 Enoch). The books named "Enoch": [[2 Enoch]], surviving only in [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] (Eng. trans. by [[R. H. Charles]] 1896)  and [[3 Enoch]] (surviving in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], c. 5th to 6th century CE).  These are ancient [[Jewish]] religious works, traditionally ascribed to the prophet [[Enoch (Biblical figure)|Enoch]], the great-grandfather of the patriarch [[Noah]]. They are not part of the [[biblical canon]] as used by [[Jews]], apart from [[Beta Israel]].  Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books of Enoch as having some historical or theological interest or significance, but they generally regard the Books of Enoch as non-canonical or non-inspired.  However, the Enoch books are treated as canonical by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].

The older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300&nbsp;BC, and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably was composed at the end of the 1st century&nbsp;BC.<ref>Fahlbusch E., Bromiley G.W. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity: P–Sh'' page 411, ISBN 0-8028-2416-1 (2004)</ref>

===== Denominational views of Pseudepigrapha =====

There arose in some Protestant biblical scholarship an extended use of the term ''pseudepigrapha'' for works that appeared as though they ought to be part of the biblical canon, because of the authorship ascribed to them, but which stood outside both the [[biblical canon]]s recognized by Protestants and Catholics. These works were also outside the particular set of books that Roman Catholics called ''deuterocanonical'' and to which Protestants had generally applied the term Apocryphal. Accordingly, the term ''pseudepigraphical'', as now used often among both Protestants and Roman Catholics (allegedly for the clarity it brings to the discussion), may make it difficult to discuss questions of pseudepigraphical authorship of canonical books dispassionately with a lay audience. To confuse the matter even more, Eastern Orthodox Christians accept books as canonical that Roman Catholics and most Protestant denominations consider pseudepigraphical or at best of much less authority. There exist also churches that reject some of the books that Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants accept. The same is true of some [[Jewish denominations|Jewish sects]]. Many works that are "apocryphal" are otherwise considered genuine.

====Role of Old Testament in Christian theology====
{{further|Sola scriptura|Christian theology}}
The Old Testament has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar [[N.T. Wright]] says "Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures."<ref>Wright, N.T.

ISBN 0-06-087261-6 / 9780060872618</ref> He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the ancient Israelites' scriptures as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus himself, generating the "new covenant" prophesied by Jeremiah.<ref name="Wright">Wright, N.T.

The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (generally minimalist), the [[Byzantine text-type]] (generally maximalist), and the [[Western text-type]] (occasionally wild). Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts.

===Development of the Christian canons===
{{Main|Development of the Old Testament canon|Development of the New Testament canon}}
The Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of [[synod]]s produced a list of texts equal to the 39, 46(51),54, or 57 book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the [[Synod of Hippo]] in AD 393. Also ''c''. 400, [[Jerome]] produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see [[Vulgate]]), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time. A definitive list did not come from an [[Ecumenical Council]] until the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Canon of the New Testament]: "The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the Tridentine Council."</ref>

During the [[Protestant Reformation]], certain reformers proposed different canonical lists to those currently in use. Though not without debate, see [[Antilegomena]], the list of New Testament books would come to remain the same; however, the Old Testament texts present in the Septuagint but not included in the Jewish canon fell out of favor. In time they would come to be removed from most Protestant canons. Hence, in a Catholic context, these texts are referred to as deuterocanonical books, whereas in a Protestant context they are referred to as the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], which means "hidden", the label applied to all texts excluded from the biblical canon but which were in the Septuagint. It should also be noted that Catholics and Protestants both describe certain other books, such as the [[Acts of Peter]], as [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Thus, the Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon—the number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division—while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Churches recognise 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 in addition to the Catholic canon. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognises a longer canon. The term "Hebrew Scriptures" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew. Both Catholics and Protestants (as well as Greek Orthodox) have the same 27-book New Testament Canon.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=gxEONS0FFlsC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=Both+Catholics+and+Protestants+have+the+same+27-book+New+Testament+Canon&source=bl&ots=t_K6gKrJKM&sig=4VIpxeGItb4s5eAyqcVZM5YzYUU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RvBtUIWiK6PY2gX0j4DIAQ&ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Both%20Catholics%20and%20Protestants%20have%20the%20same%2027-book%20New%20Testament%20Canon&f=false] ''Encyclopedia of Catholicism'', Frank K.

The three books of Meqabyan are not to be confused with the books of Maccabees. The order of the other books is somewhat different from other groups', as well. The Old Testament follows the Septuagint order for the Minor Prophets rather than the Jewish order.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Divine inspiration==
{{main|Biblical inspiration|Biblical literalism|Biblical infallibility|Biblical inerrancy}}
The Second Epistle to Timothy says that "all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness". ({{bibleref2|2 Timothy|3:16|KJV}})<ref>{{cite book|last=Grudem|first=Wayne|title=Systematic Theology|year=1994|publisher=Inter-Varsity Press|location=Leicester, England|pages=49–50}}</ref> Christians believe{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} that the Bible is the inspired word of God, that God, through the [[Holy Spirit]], intervened and influenced the words, message, and collation of the Bible. For many Christians the Bible is also [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]], and is incapable of error in matters of faith and practice, but not necessarily in historic or scientific matters. A related, but distinguishable belief is that the Bible is the [[biblical inerrancy|inerrant word of God]], without error in any aspect, spoken by God and written down in its perfect form by humans. Within these broad beliefs there are many schools of hermeneutics. "Bible scholars claim that discussions about the Bible must be put into its context within church history and then into the context of contemporary culture."<ref name="Wright" /> [[Christian fundamentalism|Fundamentalist Christians]] are associated with the doctrine of biblical literalism, where the Bible is not only inerrant, but the meaning of the text is clear to the average reader.<ref>"Beyond Biblical Literalism and Inerrancy: Conservative Protestants and the Hermeneutic Interpretation of Scripture", John Bartkowski, ''Sociology of Religion'', 57, 1996.</ref>

Timothy H. Lim, a professor of Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism at the University of Edinburgh, states that the Old Testament "was not written by one man, nor did it drop down from heaven as assumed by fundamentalists. It is not a magical book, but a collection of authoritative texts of apparently divine origin that went through a human process of writing and editing.”<ref>{{cite book |title= The Dead Sea Scrolls: A Very Short Introduction|edition= |last= Lim|first= Timothy H.|year= 2005|publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford|isbn= |page= 41}}</ref>

Belief in sacred texts is attested to in Jewish antiquity,<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''De vita Moysis'' 3.23.</ref><ref name="Josephus">Josephus, ''Contra Apion'' 1.8.</ref> and this belief can also be seen in the earliest of Christian writings.

[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|thumb|A Bible handwritten in [[Latin]], on display in [[Malmesbury Abbey]], [[Wiltshire, England]]. This Bible was transcribed in [[Belgium]] in 1407 for reading aloud in a monastery.]]
The original texts of the Tanakh were mainly in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic. In addition to the authoritative Masoretic Text, Jews still refer to the Septuagint, the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, and the [[Targum Onkelos]], an Aramaic version of the Bible. There are several different ancient versions of the Tanakh in Hebrew, mostly differing by spelling, and the traditional Jewish version is based on the version known as Aleppo Codex. Even in this version there are words which are traditionally read differently from written, because the oral tradition is considered more fundamental than the written one, and presumably mistakes had been made in copying the text over the generations.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The primary biblical text for early Christians was the Septuagint. In addition, they translated the Hebrew Bible into several other languages. Translations were made into Syriac, [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] and Latin, among other languages. The Latin translations were historically the most important for the Church in the West, while the Greek-speaking East continued to use the Septuagint translations of the Old Testament and had no need to translate the New Testament.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The earliest Latin translation was the [[Old Latin]] text, or ''[[Vetus Latina]]'', which, from internal evidence, seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time. It was based on the Septuagint, and thus included books not in the Hebrew Bible.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[Pope Damasus I]] assembled the first list of books of the Bible at the [[Council of Rome]] in AD 382. He commissioned Saint [[Jerome]] to produce a reliable and consistent text by translating the original Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin. This translation became known as the [[Vulgate|Latin Vulgate Bible]] and in 1546 at the [[Council of Trent]] was declared by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only authentic and official Bible in the [[Latin Rite]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[Bible translations]] for many languages have been made. The Bible continues to be translated to new languages, largely by Christian organisations such as [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]], [[New Tribes Mission]] and the [[Bible society]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[John Riches (Professor of Divinity and Biblical Criticism at the University of Glasgow)|John Riches ]] provides the following analysis of the Bible:

<blockquote>It has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art; it has equally fuelled some of the worst excesses of human savagery, self-interest, and narrow-mindedness. It has inspired men and women to acts of great service and courage, to fight for liberation and human development; and it has provided the ideological fuel for societies which have enslaved their fellow human beings and reduced them to abject poverty. ... It has, perhaps above all, provided a source of religious and moral norms which have enabled communities to hold together, to care for, and to protect one another; yet precisely this strong sense of belonging has in turn fuelled ethnic, racial, and international tension and conflict.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Bible: A Very Short Introduction|edition= |last= Riches|first= John|year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-285343-1|page= 134}}</ref></blockquote>

===Other religions===
{{main|Islamic view of the Christian Bible}}
In [[Islam]], the Bible is held to reflect true unfolding [[revelation]] from [[God in Islam|God]]; but revelation which had been corrupted or distorted (in Arabic: ''[[tahrif]]''); which necessitated the giving of the [[Qur'an]] to the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], to correct this deviation.

Members of other religions may also seek inspiration from the Bible. For example Rastafaris view the Bible as essential to their religion<ref>Becoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica - Page 171, Charles Price - 2009</ref> and Unitarian Universalists view it as "one of many important religious texts".<ref>Unitarian Universalism - Page 42, Zondervan Publishing, 2009</ref>

===Biblical studies===
{{Main|Biblical studies|Biblical criticism}}
[[Biblical criticism]] refers to the investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention. It is not the same as [[criticism of the Bible]], which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance, or observations that the Bible may have [[translation]] errors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baptistlink.com/creationists/expondoerrossbinvi.htm|title=Expondo Os Erros Da Sociedade Bíblica Internacional|publisher=Baptistlink.com|year=2000|accessdate=2012-01-13}}</ref>

===Higher criticism===
{{Main|Higher criticism|Lower criticism}}
In the 17th century [[Thomas Hobbes]] collected the current evidence to conclude outright that Moses could not have written the bulk of the Torah. Shortly afterwards the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] published a unified critical analysis, arguing that the problematic passages were not isolated cases that could be explained away one by one, but pervasive throughout the five books, concluding that it was "clearer than the sun at noon that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses . . ."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=xtq2ZyKf-YQC&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=clearer+than+the+sun+at+noon+that+the+Pentateuch+was+not+written+by+Moses&source=bl&ots=20Bz7dfslQ&sig=rsPuYGb80r-lWjCFAtW0U8q7LaY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7W9WUJu7DIrW9QT5vYGgBA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=clearer%20than%20the%20sun%20at%20noon%20that%20the%20Pentateuch%20was%20not%20written%20by%20Moses&f=false] ''In the Beginning: Hijacking of the Religion of God'', Volume 1 by Sami M.

==Archaeological and historical research==
{{Main|Biblical archaeology school|The Bible and history}}
Biblical archaeology is the [[archaeology]] that relates to and sheds light upon the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures (or "New Testament"). It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times. There are a wide range of interpretations in the field of biblical archaeology. One broad division includes [[biblical maximalism]] which generally takes the view that most of the Old Testament or [[Hebrew Bible]] is based on history although it is presented through the religious viewpoint of its time. It is considered the opposite of [[Biblical Minimalism|biblical minimalism]] which considers the Bible a purely [[post-exilic]] (5th century BCE and later) composition. Even among those scholars who adhere to biblical minimalism, the Bible is a historical document containing first-hand information on the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman era]]s, and there is universal scholarly consensus that the events of the 6th century BCE [[Babylonian captivity]] have a basis in history.

The historicity of the biblical account of the [[history of ancient Israel and Judah]] of the 10th to 7th-centuries BCE is disputed in scholarship. The biblical account of the 8th to 7th centuries BCE is widely, but not universally, accepted as historical, while the verdict on the earliest period of the [[United Monarchy]] (10th-century BCE) and the [[historicity of David]] is unclear. Archaeological evidence providing information on this period, such as the [[Tel Dan Stele]], can potentially be decisive. The biblical account of events of the [[Exodus from Egypt]] in the [[Torah]], and the migration to the [[Promised Land]] and the period of [[Biblical judges|Judges]] are not considered historical in scholarship.<ref>{{cite book|last=Finkelstein|first=Israel|authorlink=Israel Finkelstein|title=The Bible Unearthed|coauthors=Neil Silberman}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dever|first=William|authorlink=William G. Dever|title=[[Who Were the Early Israelites and Where Did They Come from?]]}}</ref> Regarding the [[New Testament]], the setting being the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century CE, the historical context is well established. There has been some debate on the [[historicity of Jesus]], but the mainstream opinion is that Jesus was one of several known historical itinerant preachers in 1st-century [[Roman Judea]], teaching in the context of the religious upheavals and sectarianism of [[Second Temple Judaism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of the Bible}}
In modern times, the view that the Bible should be accepted as historically accurate and as a reliable guide to morality has been questioned by many mainstream academics in the field of biblical criticism. Most Christian groups claim that the Bible is inspired by God, and some oppose interpretations of the Bible that are not traditional or "plain reading". Some groups within the most conservative Protestant circles believe that the [[Authorized King James Version]] is the only accurate English translation of the Bible, and accept it as infallible. They are generally referred to as "[[King James Only]]". Many within [[Christian fundamentalism]] – as well as much of [[Orthodox Judaism]]—strongly support the idea that the Bible is a historically accurate record of actual events and a primary source of moral guidance.

In addition to concerns about morality, inerrancy, or historicity, there remain some questions of which books should be included in the Bible (see [[Biblical canon|canon of scripture]]). Jews discount the [[New Testament]], most Christians deny the legitimacy of the [[New Testament apocrypha]], and a view sometimes referred to as [[Jesusism]] does not affirm the scriptural authority of any biblical text other than the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels.
