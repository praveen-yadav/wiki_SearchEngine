'''Beryllium''' is the [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Be''' and [[atomic number]] 4. Because any beryllium [[nucleosynthesis|synthesized]] in [[star]]s is short-lived, it is a relatively rare element in both the [[universe]] and in the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] of the Earth. It is a [[divalent]] element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable [[gemstones]] which contain beryllium include [[beryl]] ([[Aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]], [[emerald]]) and [[chrysoberyl]]. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle [[alkaline earth metal]].

Beryllium increases hardness and resistance to [[corrosion]] when [[alloy]]ed with [[aluminium]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]] (notably [[beryllium copper]]), [[iron]] and [[nickel]].<ref name=deGruyter/> In structural applications, high [[flexural rigidity]], [[thermal stability]], [[thermal conductivity]] and low [[density]] (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium a quality [[aerospace]] material for high-speed aircraft, [[missile]]s, [[space vehicle]]s and [[communication satellite]]s.<ref name=deGruyter/> Because of its low density and [[atomic mass]], beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of [[ionizing radiation]]; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and in [[particle physics experiments]].<ref name=deGruyter/> The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and [[beryllium oxide]] have led to their use in [[heat conduction|heat transport]] and [[heat sink]]ing applications.

The commercial use of beryllium presents technical challenges due to the [[toxicity]] (especially by inhalation) of beryllium-containing dusts. Beryllium is corrosive to tissue, and can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease called [[berylliosis]] in some people. The element is not known to be necessary or useful for either plant or animal life.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nchem.1033|title=A brighter beryllium|year=2011|last1=Puchta|first1=Ralph|journal=Nature Chemistry|volume=3|issue=5|pages=416|pmid=21505503|bibcode=2011NatCh...3..416P }}</ref>

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Beryllium is a steel gray and hard metal that is brittle at room temperature and has a close-packed hexagonal [[crystal structure]].<ref name=deGruyter>{{cite book

The [[modulus of elasticity]] of beryllium is approximately 50% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast [[speed of sound|sound conduction speed]] in beryllium – about 12.9&nbsp;km/s at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient conditions]]. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg<sup>−1</sup>·K<sup>−1</sup>) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m<sup>−1</sup>·K<sup>−1</sup>), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear [[thermal expansion]] (11.4×10<sup>−6</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.<ref name=Be>{{Cite book| title=Landolt-Börnstein&nbsp;– Group VIII Advanced Materials and Technologies: Powder Metallurgy Data.

===Nuclear properties===
Natural beryllium, save for slight contamination by cosmogenic radioisotopes, is essentially beryllium-9, which has a nuclear spin of 3/2-. Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 [[barn (unit)|barns]] for energies above approximately 10 KeV. Therefore, it works as a neutron reflector and [[neutron moderator]], effectively slowing the neutrons to the [[neutron temperature|thermal energy]] range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower – exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.

The single primordial beryllium isotope <sup>9</sup>Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1.9 MeV, to produce <sup>8</sup>Be, which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles. Thus, for high-energy neutrons beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs. This nuclear reaction is:<ref name ="BeMelurgy"/>
:{{Nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + n → 2({{Nuclide|Helium|4}}) + 2n

Neutrons are liberated when beryllium [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are struck by energetic [[alpha particle]]s<ref name=Be/> producing the nuclear reaction
:{{Nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + {{Nuclide|Helium|4}} → {{Nuclide|Carbon|12}} + n , where {{Nuclide|Helium|4}} is an alpha particle and {{Nuclide|Carbon|12}} is a [[carbon-12]] nucleus.<ref name ="BeMelurgy">{{Cite book| url=http://books.google.com/?id=FCnUN45cL1cC&pg=PA239|page=239|chapter=Nuclear Properties|title=Beryllium its Metallurgy and Properties|publisher=University of California Press|first=Henry H|last=Hausner| year=1965}}</ref>
Beryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope-powered [[nuclear reaction]] [[neutron source]]s for the laboratory production of free neutrons.

As a metal, beryllium is [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to most wavelengths of [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s, making it useful for the output windows of [[X-ray tube]]s and other such apparatus.

===Isotopes and nucleosynthesis===
{{Main|Isotopes of beryllium|beryllium-10}}
Both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but these do not last long. It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when [[cosmic rays]] induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ILQ7sTrRixMC&pg=PA172|title=Physics: 1981–1990|author=Ekspong, G. |publisher=World Scientific|year=1992|pages=172 ff.|isbn=978-981-02-0729-8|display-authors=1}}</ref> Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, <sup>9</sup>Be, and therefore beryllium is a [[monoisotopic element]].

[[File:Solar Activity Proxies.png|thumb|left|300px|Plot showing variations in solar activity, including variation in sunspot number (red) and <sup>10</sup>Be concentration (blue). Note that the beryllium scale is inverted, so increases on this scale indicate lower <sup>10</sup>Be levels]]
Radioactive [[cosmogenic]] <sup>10</sup>Be is produced in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere of the Earth]] by the [[cosmic ray spallation]] of [[oxygen]]<!-- NEEDS CITE and [[nitrogen]]-->.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=56}} <sup>10</sup>Be accumulates at the [[soil]] surface, where its relatively long [[half-life]] (1.36 million years) permits a long [[residence time]] before decaying to [[boron]]-10. Thus, <sup>10</sup>Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural [[soil erosion]], [[soil formation]] and the development of [[laterite|lateritic soils]], and as a [[Proxy (climate)|proxy]] for measurement of the variations in [[solar variation|solar activity]] and the age of [[ice core]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.sahra.arizona.edu/programs/isotopes/beryllium.html|title=Beryllium: Isotopes and Hydrology|publisher=University of Arizona, Tucson |accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref> The production of <sup>10</sup>Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased [[solar wind]] during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s that reach the Earth.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=56}} Nuclear explosions also form <sup>10</sup>Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with <sup>13</sup>C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at [[nuclear weapon test]] sites.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.016|year=2008|month=Feb|author=Whitehead, N; Endo, S; Tanaka, K; Takatsuji, T; Hoshi, M; Fukutani, S; Ditchburn, Rg; Zondervan, A|title=A preliminary study on the use of (10)Be in forensic radioecology of nuclear explosion sites|volume=99|issue=2|pages=260–70 |pmid=17904707|journal=Journal of environmental radioactivity}}</ref>
The isotope <sup>7</sup>Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots, much like <sup>10</sup>Be.

<sup>8</sup>Be has a very short half-life of about 7{{e|-17}}&nbsp;s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the [[Big Bang]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=R. N. |last2=Kajino |first2= T. |year=1989 |title=Can Be-9 provide a test of cosmological theories? |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=336|bibcode=1989ApJ...336L..55B |pages=L55 |doi=10.1086/185360}}</ref> This is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang's [[nucleosynthesis]] phase to produce carbon by the fusion of <sup>4</sup>He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available [[beryllium-8]]. The British [[astronomer]] Sir [[Fred Hoyle]] first showed that the energy levels of <sup>8</sup>Be and <sup>12</sup>C allow carbon production by the so-called [[triple-alpha process]] in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available. This process allows carbon to be produced in stars, but not in the Big Bang. Star-created carbon (the basis of [[carbon-based life]]) is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by [[AGB star]]s and [[supernova]]e (see also [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]), as well as the creation of all other elements with [[atomic number]]s larger than that of carbon.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=PXGWGnPPo0gC&pg=PA223|page=223|title=Supernovae and nucleosynthesis|author=Arnett, David |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=0-691-01147-8}}</ref>

The innermost electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding. Therefore, when <sup>7</sup>Be decays by [[electron capture]], it does so by taking electrons from [[atomic orbital]]s that may participate in bonding. This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its electron configuration&nbsp;– a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/decay_rates.html|title=How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates|first=Bill|last=Johnson|publisher=University of California, Riverside|accessdate =30 March 2008 |year=1993}}</ref>

The shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is <sup>13</sup>Be which decays through [[neutron emission]]. It has a half-life of 2.7&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>−21</sup> s. <sup>6</sup>Be is also very short-lived with a half-life of 5.0&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>−21</sup> s.<ref name=crc>Hammond, C. R.

==Production==
The extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed. The United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial scale extraction of beryllium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beryllium.com/sources-beryllium |title=Sources of Beryllium |work=Materion Brush Inc. |publisher=Materion Brush Inc. |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref>

Beryllium is most-commonly extracted from [[beryl]], which is either [[sintering|sintered]] using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture. The sintering process involves mixing beryl with [[sodium fluorosilicate]] and soda at 770&nbsp;°C to form [[sodium fluoroberyllate]], [[aluminium oxide]] and [[silicon dioxide]].<ref name=deGruyter/> [[Beryllium hydroxide]] is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and [[sodium hydroxide]] in water. Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to 1,650&nbsp;°C.<ref name=deGruyter/> The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated 250 to 300&nbsp;°C in concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], mostly yielding [[beryllium sulfate]] and [[aluminium sulfate]].<ref name=deGruyter/> Aqueous [[ammonia]] is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur, leaving beryllium hydroxide.

Beryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into [[beryllium fluoride]] or [[beryllium chloride]]. To form the fluoride, aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate, which is heated to 1,000°C to form beryllium fluoride.<ref name=deGruyter/> Heating the fluoride to 900&nbsp;°C with [[magnesium]] forms finely divided beryllium and additional heating to 1,300&nbsp;°C creates the compact metal.<ref name=deGruyter/> Heating beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide which becomes beryllium chloride when mixed with carbon and chloride. [[Electrolysis]] of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal.<ref name=deGruyter/>

Beryllium's chemical behavior is largely a result of its small [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic]] radii. It thus has very high [[ionization potential]]s and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are [[Covalent bond|covalent]].<ref name=deGruyter/> It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.<ref name=deGruyter/>
An oxide layer forms around beryllium that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000&nbsp;°C.<ref name=deGruyter/><ref name="Greenwood">{{Greenwood&Earnshaw}}</ref> Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming a mixture of [[beryllium oxide]] and [[beryllium nitride]].<ref name="Greenwood"/> Beryllium dissolves readily in non-[[oxidizing acid]]s, such as HCl and diluted H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, but not in [[nitric acid]] or water as this forms the oxide.<ref name=deGruyter/> This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.<ref name=deGruyter/>

[[File:BeHydrolysis.png|thumb|Beryllium hydrolysis as a function of pH<br />Water molecules attached to Be are omitted]]
The beryllium atom has the electronic configuration [He] 2s<sup>2</sup>. The two valence electrons give beryllium a +2 [[oxidation state]] and thus the ability to form two [[covalent bond]]s; the only evidence of lower valence of beryllium is in the solubility of the metal in [[beryllium dichloride|BeCl<sub>2</sub>]].<ref name="Wiberg&Holleman">{{Cite book|author=Wiberg, Egon; Holleman, Arnold Frederick|year=2001|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-12-352651-5}}</ref> Due to the [[octet rule]], atoms tend to seek a valence of 8 in order to resemble a [[noble gas]]. Beryllium tries to achieve a [[coordination number]] of 4 because its two covalent bonds fill half of this octet.<ref name=deGruyter/> A coordination of 4 allows beryllium compounds, such as the fluoride or chloride, to form polymers.

This characteristic is employed in analytical techniques using [[EDTA]] as a ligand. EDTA preferentially forms [[Octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral complexes]]&nbsp;– thus absorbing other cations such as Al<sup>3+</sup> which might interfere – for example, in the [[Liquid-liquid extraction|solvent extraction]] of a complex formed between Be<sup>2+</sup> and [[acetylacetone]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Determination of a trace amount of beryllium in water samples by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry after preconcentration and separation as a beryllium-acetylacetonate complex on activated carbon|author=Okutani, T.; Tsuruta, Y.; Sakuragawa, A. |journal=Anal.

Solutions of beryllium salts, e.g. [[beryllium sulfate]] and [[beryllium nitrate]], are acidic because of hydrolysis of the [Be(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> ion.

Other products of hydrolysis include the [[trimer (chemistry)|trimeric]] ion [Be<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>. [[Beryllium hydroxide]], Be(OH)<sub>2</sub>, is insoluble even in acidic solutions with pH less than 6, that is at biological pH. It is [[Amphoterism|amphoteric]] and dissolves in strongly [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] solutions.

Beryllium forms [[binary compound]]s with many non-metals. [[Anhydrous]] [[halide]]s are known for [[fluorine|F]], [[chlorine|Cl]], [[bromine|Br]] and [[iodine|I]]. [[beryllium fluoride|BeF<sub>2</sub>]] has a [[silica]]-like structure with corner-shared BeF<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra. [[beryllium chloride|BeCl<sub>2</sub>]] and [[beryllium bromide|BeBr<sub>2</sub>]] have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra. All beryllium halides have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase.<ref name="Greenwood"/>

[[Beryllium difluoride]], BeF<sub>2</sub>, is different than the other [[difluoride]]s.  In general, beryllium has a tendency to bond covalently, much more so than the other [[alkaline earth metal|alkaline earths]] and its fluoride is partially covalent (although still more ionic than its other halides).  BeF<sub>2</sub> has many similarities to [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]] (quartz) a mostly covalently bonded [[network solid]].

==History==
The mineral [[beryl]], which contains beryllium, has been used at least since the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of Egypt.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=535}} In the first century [[Common Era|CE]], Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned in his encyclopedia ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' that beryl and [[emerald]] ("smaragdus") were similar.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=536}} The [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis]], written in the third or fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=536}}

[[File:Louis Nicolas Vauquelin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin]] discovered beryllium]]
Early analyses of emeralds and beryls by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Torbern Olof Bergman]], [[Franz Karl Achard]], and Johann Jakob Bindheim always yielded similar elements, leading to the fallacious conclusion that both substances are [[aluminium silicate]]s.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=537}} Mineralogist [[René Just Haüy]] discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical, and he asked chemist [[Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin]] for a chemical analysis.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=535}}

In a 1798 paper read before the [[Institut de France]], Vauquelin reported that he found a new "earth" by dissolving [[aluminium hydroxide]] from emerald and beryl in an additional [[alkali]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Annales de Chimie| first=Louis-Nicolas|last=Vauquelin|title=De l'Aiguemarine, ou Béril; et découverie d'une terre nouvelle dans cette pierre| trans_title=Aquamarine or beryl; and discovery of a new earth in this stone | year=1798| volume=26|pages=155–169|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dB8AAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA155}}</ref> The editors of the journal ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'' named the new earth "glucine" for the sweet taste of some of its compounds.<ref>In a footnote on [http://books.google.com/books?id=dB8AAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false page 169] of (Vauquelin, 1798), the editors write:  "(1)  La propriété la plus caractéristique de cette terre, confirmée par les dernières expériences de notre collègue, étant de former des sels d'une saveur sucrée, nous proposons de l'appeler ''glucine'', de γλυχυς, ''doux'', γλυχύ, ''vin doux'', γλυχαιτω, ''rendre doux'' … ''Note des Rédacteurs''."  ((1)  The most characteristic property of this earth, confirmed by the recent experiments of our colleague [Vauquelin], being to form salts with a sweet taste, we propose to call it ''glucine'' from γλυχυς, ''sweet'', γλυχύ, ''sweet wine'', γλυχαιτω, ''to make sweet'' … ''Note of the editors''.)</ref> Klaproth preferred the name "beryllina" due to fact that [[yttria]] also formed sweet salts.<ref>Klaproth, Martin Heinrich, ''Beitrage zur Chemischen Kenntniss der Mineralkörper'' (Contribution to the chemical knowledge of mineral substances), vol. 3, (Berlin, (Germany):  Heinrich August Rottmann, 1802), [http://books.google.com/books?id=8A8KAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false pages 78-79]:  "Als Vauquelin der von ihm im Beryll und Smaragd entdeckten neuen Erde, wegen ihrer Eigenschaft, süsse Mittelsalze zu bilden, den Namen ''Glykine'', ''Süsserde'', beilegte, erwartete er wohl nicht, dass sich bald nachher eine anderweitige Erde finden würde, welche mit völlig gleichem Rechte Anspruch an diesen Namen machen können.  Um daher keine Verwechselung derselben mit der Yttererde zu veranlassen, würde es vielleicht gerathen seyn, jenen Namen ''Glykine'' aufzugeben, und durch Beryllerde (''Beryllina'') zu ersetzen; welche Namensveränderung auch bereits vom Hrn.

Therefore, in order to avoid confusion of it with yttria-earth, it would perhaps be advisable to abandon this name ''glycine'' and replace it with beryl-earth (''beryllina''); which name change was also recommended by Prof. Link, and for the reason that a genus of plants, ''Glycine'', already exists.)</ref>{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=538}}  The name "beryllium" was first used by Wöhler in 1828.<ref>Wöhler, F.

:BeCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 K → 2 KCl + Be
Using an alcohol lamp, Wöhler heated alternating layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder he saw that it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=539}} The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the [[electrolysis]] of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.

The direct [[electrolysis]] of a molten mixture of [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[sodium fluoride]] by [[Paul Lebeau]] in 1898 resulted in the first pure (99.5 to 99.8%) samples of beryllium.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=539}}<!-- NEEDS CITE It took until World War I (1914–18) before significant amounts of beryllium were produced, but large-scale production was not started until early 1930s.--> The first commercially-successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1932 by [[Alfred Stock]] and [[Hans Goldschmidt]].{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=539}} Their process involves the electrolysation of a mixture of beryllium fluorides and [[barium]], which causes molten beryllium to collect on a water-cooled iron [[cathode]].

A sample of beryllium was bombarded with [[alpha ray]]s from the decay of [[radium]] in a 1932 experiment by [[James Chadwick]] that uncovered the existence of the [[neutron]].{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory [[neutron source]]s that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.<ref name=Merck/>

Beryllium production saw a rapid increase during World War II, due to the rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and [[phosphor]]s for [[fluorescent light]]s. Most early fluorescent lamps used [[zinc orthosilicate]] with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium [[tungstate]] improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=A Review of Early Inorganic Phosphors|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=klE5qGAltjAC&pg=PA98|page=98|title=Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress|isbn=978-0-88173-378-5|author1=Kane, Raymond|author2=Sell, Heinz|year=2001}}</ref>

[[Electrolysis]] of a mixture of [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[sodium fluoride]] was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the [[alkali metals]]. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of [[beryllium iodide]] was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of [[zirconium]], but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/08827508808952633|title=Beryllium Extraction&nbsp;– A Review|year=1988|author=Babu, R.

Pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as [[beryllium chloride]] with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified [[magnesium]].

===Etymology===
Early usage of the word ''beryllium'' can be traced to many languages, including [[Latin]] ''Beryllus''; French ''Béry''; [[Greek language|Greek]] ''βήρυλλος'', ''bērullos'', ''beryl''; [[Prakrit]] ''veruliya'' (वॆरुलिय‌); [[Pāli]] ''veḷuriya'' (वेलुरिय), ''veḷiru'' (भेलिरु) or ''viḷar'' (भिलर्) – "to become pale", in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl. The original source is probably the [[Sanskrit]] word वैडूर्य vaidurya-, which is of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin and could be derived from the name of the modern city of [[Belur]].<ref>{{OEtymD|beryl}}</ref> For about 160 years, beryllium was also known as {{anchor|Glucinium}} '''glucinum''' or '''glucinium''' (with the accompanying chemical symbol "'''Gl'''",<ref>Black, The MacMillian Company, New York, 1937</ref>), the name coming from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for sweet: γλυκυς, due to the sweet taste of beryllium [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/4.shtml |title=Periodic Table of Elements: Los Alamos National Laboratory: Beryllium |date=2010–11 |work=Periodic Table of Elements: [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|LANL]] |publisher=[[Los Alamos National Security]] |accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref>

==Applications==
It is estimated that most beryllium is used for military applications, so information is not readily available.<ref>Petzow, Günter ''et al.'' "Beryllium and Beryllium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a04_011.pub2}}</ref>

===Radiation windows===
[[File:Beryllium target.jpg|thumb|left|Beryllium target which "converts" a proton beam into a neutron beam]]
[[File:Be foil square.jpg|thumb|right|A square beryllium foil mounted in a steel case to be used as a window between a vacuum chamber and an [[X-ray microscope]]. Beryllium is highly transparent to X-rays owing to its low [[atomic number]].]]
Because of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X-rays, the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for [[X-ray tube]]s.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of [[synchrotron]] radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]]) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100 eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.<ref name=Be/>

Low [[atomic number]] also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic [[Elementary particle|particles]]. Therefore it is used to build the [[beamline|beam pipe]] around the collision region in [[particle physics]] setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] ([[A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]], [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]], [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]], [[LHCb]]),<ref>{{Cite web| title=Installation and commissioning of vacuum systems for the LHC particle detectors|publisher=CERN|first1 =R.|last1=Veness|first2 =D.|last2 =Ramos|first3 =P.|last3 =Lepeule|first4 =A.|last4=Rossi|first5 =G.|last5 =Schneider|first6 =S.|last6 =Blanchard|url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/PAC2009/papers/mo6rfp010.pdf}}</ref> the [[Tevatron]] and the [[SLAC]]. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above [[absolute zero]], and its [[diamagnetic]] nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and [[strong focusing|focus]] the [[particle beam]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(01)01149-4|title=A new inner vertex detector for STAR|year=2001|author=Wieman, H|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section a Accelerators Spectrometers Detectors and Associated Equipment|volume=473|pages=205|bibcode=2001NIMPA.473..205W|last2=Bieser|first2=F.|last3=Kleinfelder|first3=S.|last4=Matis|first4=H.S.|last5=Nevski|first5=P.|last6=Rai|first6=G.|last7=Smirnov|first7=N.}}</ref>

===Mechanical applications===
Because of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and [[aerospace]] industries in high-speed [[aircraft]], [[guided missile]]s, [[space vehicle]]s, and [[satellite]]s. Several [[liquid-fuel rocket]]s have used [[rocket engine nozzle|rocket nozzles]] made of pure beryllium.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=IpEnvBtSfPQC&pg=PA690| title=Metals handbook|chapter=Beryllium|first=Joseph R.|last=Davis|publisher=ASM International|year=1998|isbn=978-0-87170-654-6|pages=690–691}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6fdmMuj0rNEC&pg=PA62|page=62|title=Encyclopedia of materials, parts, and finishes|author=Schwartz, Mel M. |publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=1-56676-661-3}}</ref> Beryllium powder was itself studied as a [[rocket fuel]], but this use has never materialized.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} A small number of [[bicycle frame]]s were built with beryllium, at "astonishing" prices.<ref name=museum>{{cite web|url=http://mombat.org/American.htm|title=Museum of Mountain Bike Art & Technology: American Bicycle Manufacturing}}</ref> From 1998 to 2000, the [[McLaren]] [[Formula One]] team used [[Mercedes-Benz]] engines with beryllium-aluminium-[[alloy]] pistons.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Wayne|title=Aluminium-Beryllium|url=http://www.ret-monitor.com/articles/967/aluminium-beryllium/|publisher=Ret-Monitor|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by [[Scuderia Ferrari]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Collantine|first=Keith|title=Banned! – Beryllium|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/02/08/banned-beryllium/|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref>

The high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation, e.g. in  [[inertial guidance]] systems and in the support mechanisms for optical systems.<ref name=Be/> Beryllium-copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in "Jason pistols", which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1 February 2005|accessdate=8 August 2009|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Defence-forces-face-rare-toxic-metal-exposure-risk/2005/02/01/1107228681666.html|title=Defence forces face rare toxic metal exposure risk|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

An earlier major application of beryllium was in [[brake]]s for military [[airplane]]s because of its hardness, high melting point, and exceptional ability to [[heat dissipation|dissipate heat]]. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.<ref name=Be/>

To reduce costs, beryllium can be [[alloy]]ed with significant amounts of [[aluminium]], resulting in the [[AlBeMet]] alloy  (a trade name). This blend is cheaper than pure beryllium, while still retaining many desirable properties.

===Mirrors===
Beryllium [[mirror]]s are of particular interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a [[honeycomb mirror|honeycomb support structure]], are used, for example, in [[meteorological satellite]]s where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in [[control system|optical guidance]] systems and in [[fire-control system]]s, e.g. in the German-made [[Leopard 1]] and [[Leopard 2]] [[main battle tank]]s. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard [[electroless nickel plating]] which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to [[cryogenic]] operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.<ref name=Be/>

===Magnetic applications===
Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of beryllium are used by naval or military [[explosive ordnance disposal]] teams for work on or near [[naval mine]]s, since these mines commonly have [[fuze|magnetic fuzes]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=AD0263919|title=The selection of low-magnetic alloys for EOD tools|publisher= Naval Weapons Plant Washington DC|author= Kojola, Kenneth ; Lurie, William|date=9 August 1961}}</ref> They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated by them.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EqtlqFNkWwQC&pg=PT891|page=891|title=Understanding anesthesia equipment|author=Dorsch, Jerry A. and Dorsch, Susan E.|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2007|isbn=0-7817-7603-1}}</ref> In the fields of [[radio communication]]s and powerful (usually military) [[radar]]s, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic [[klystron]]s, [[magnetron]]s, [[traveling wave tube]]s, etc., that are used for generating high levels of [[microwave]] power in the [[transmitter]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=yZ786vEild0C&pg=PA7|page=7|title=Encyclopedia of the Alkaline Earth Compounds|isbn=9780444595539|author1=Ropp|first1=Richard C|date=2012-12-31}}</ref>

===Nuclear applications===
Thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in [[nuclear weapon design]]s as the very outer layer of the [[plutonium pit]]s in the primary stages of [[thermonuclear bomb]]s, placed to surround the [[fissile]] material. These layers of beryllium are good "pushers" for the [[implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] of the [[plutonium-239]], and they are also good [[neutron reflector]]s, just as they are in beryllium-moderated [[nuclear reactors]].<ref name=weapons/>

Beryllium is also commonly used in some [[neutron source]]s in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor, or a [[particle accelerator]]-powered [[neutron generator]]). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a [[radioisotope]] such as [[polonium]]-210, [[radium]]-226, [[plutonium]]-239, or [[americium]]-241. In the nuclear reaction that occurs, a beryllium nucleus is [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading. Such [[alpha decay]] driven beryllium neutron sources, named [[Modulated neutron initiator|"urchin"]] neutron initiators, were used some in early [[atomic bomb]]s.<ref name=weapons>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=yTIOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA35|page=35|title=How nuclear weapons spread|author=Barnaby, Frank |publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=0-415-07674-9}}</ref> Neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with [[gamma ray]]s from a [[gamma decay]] radioisotope, are also used to produce laboratory neutrons.<ref>Byrne, J.

Beryllium is also used in fuel fabrication for [[CANDU]] reactors.  The fuel elements have small appendages that are resistance brazed to the fuel cladding using an induction brazing process with Be as the braze filler material.  Bearing pads are brazed on to prevent fuel bundle to pressure tube contact, and inter-element spacer pads are brazed on to prevent element to element contact.

===Acoustics===
Low weight and high rigidity of beryllium make it useful as a material for high-frequency [[speaker driver]]s. Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than [[titanium]]), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium [[tweeter]]s are limited to high-end home,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scan-speak.dk/news/20100429a.pdf |publisher=Scan Speak|accessdate=1 May 2010|title=Scan Speak offers Be tweeters to OEMs and Do-It-Yourselfers}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/speakers/232-usher-be-718-bookshelf-speakers-with-beryllium-tweeters.html|first=John E.|last=Johnson, Jr.|date=12 November 2007|accessdate =18 September 2008|title=Usher Be-718 Bookshelf Speakers with Beryllium Tweeters}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.krksys.com/krk-studio-monitor-speakers/expose.html |publisher=KRK Systems|accessdate =12 February 2009|title=Exposé E8B studio monitor}}</ref> [[pro audio]], and [[public address]] applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.focalprofessional.com/en/technologies/index.php#tabs-2|accessdate =10 July 2010|title=Beryllium use in pro audio Focal speakers}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vueaudio.com/press/|accessdate=21 May 2012|title=VUE Audio announces use of Be in Pro Audio loudspeakers}}</ref> Due to the high performance of beryllium in acoustics, for marketing purposes some products are claimed to be made of the material when they are not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/45957370/BRUSH-WELLMAN|first=Mark|last=Svilar|date=8 January 2004|accessdate =13 February 2009|title=Analysis of "Beryllium" Speaker Dome and Cone Obtained from China}}</ref>

===Electronic===
Beryllium is a [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] [[dopant]] in [[List of semiconductor materials|III-V compound semiconductors]]. It is widely used in materials such as [[gallium arsenide|GaAs]], [[AlGaAs]], [[InGaAs]] and [[InAlAs]] grown by [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=oJs6nK3TZrwC&pg=PA104|page=104|title=High-power diode lasers|author=Diehl, Roland |publisher=Springer|year=2000|isbn=3-540-66693-1}}</ref> Cross-rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for [[printed circuit board]]s in [[surface-mount technology]]. In critical electronic applications, beryllium is both a structural support and [[heat sink]]. The application also requires a coefficient of [[thermal expansion]] that is well matched to the alumina and [[glass-reinforced plastic|polyimide-glass]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrates]]. The beryllium-beryllium oxide [[metal matrix composite|composite]] "[[E-Material]]s" have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials.<ref name=Be/>

[[Beryllium oxide]] is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an [[electrical insulator]] and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in [[power semiconductor device|high-power]] [[transistor]]s in [[radio frequency]] [[transmitter]]s for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the [[thermal conductivity]] of [[uranium dioxide]] [[nuclear fuel]] pellets.<ref>{{Cite web

==Precautions==
{{Main|Beryllium poisoning}}
Approximately 35&nbsp;micrograms of beryllium is found in the human body, but this amount is not considered harmful.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=57}} Beryllium is chemically similar to [[magnesium]] and therefore can displace it from [[enzyme]]s, which causes them to malfunction.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=57}} Chronic [[berylliosis]] is a [[pulmonary]] and [[systemic circulation|systemic]] [[granuloma]]tous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium; either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment. Symptoms of the disease can take up to five years to develop; about a third of patients with it die and the survivors are left disabled.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=57}} The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) lists beryllium and beryllium compounds as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Category 1 carcinogens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol58/mono58-1.html|publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer|title=IARC Monograph, Volume 58|year=1993|accessdate =18 September 2008}}</ref>

Acute beryllium disease in the form of [[chemical pneumonitis]] was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing [[fluorescent lamp]]s in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=5}} Chronic berylliosis resembles [[sarcoidosis]] in many respects, and the [[differential diagnosis]] is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as [[Herbert L. Anderson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Photos/CP1/image5.shtml|title=Photograph of Chicago Pile One Scientists 1946|date=19 June 2006|publisher=Office of Public Affairs, Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate =18 September 2008}}</ref>

Early researchers tasted beryllium and its various compounds for sweetness in order to verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt should be made to ingest this highly toxic substance.<ref name=deGruyter/> Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust ([[lung cancer]] is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc106.htm |title=Beryllium: ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CRITERIA 106 |author=International Programme On Chemical Safety |year= 1990 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref>

A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute [[ammonium bifluoride]] for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D7458.htm|title=ASTM D7458&nbsp;–08|accessdate=8 August 2009|publisher=American Society for Testing and Materials}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1520/JAI13168|title=Development of a New Fluorescence Method for the Detection of Beryllium on Surfaces|year=2005|last1=Minogue|first1 =EM|last2=Ehler|first2=DS|last3=Burrell|first3=AK|last4= McCleskey|first4=TM|last5=Taylor|first5=TP|journal=Journal of ASTM International|volume=2|pages=13168|issue=9}}</ref>
