A '''century''' (from the [[Latin]] ''centum'', meaning ''one hundred''; abbreviated '''c.''') is [[one hundred]] [[year]]s. Centuries are numbered [[names of numbers in English#Ordinal numbers|ordinally]] in [[English language|English]] and many other languages (e.g. "the 7th century AD/CE").

==Dating units in other calendar systems==
Besides the Gregorian calendar, the [[Julian calendar]], the [[Aztec calendar]], and the [[Hindu calendar]] have cycles of years that are used to delineate whole time periods; the Hindu calendar, in particular, summarizes its years into groups of 60,<ref>{{cite web|title=www.vedavidyalaya.com|url=http://www.vedavidyalaya.com/varsham.htm|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> while the Aztec calendar considers groups of 52.<ref>{{cite web|title=www.aztec-history.com|url=http://www.aztec-history.com/aztec-calendar.html|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>

==Centuries in astronomical year numbering==
[[Astronomical year numbering]], used by [[astronomers]], includes a year [[zero]] (0).<ref>{{cite web|title=www.princeton.edu|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Astronomical_year_numbering.html|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> Consequently, the 1st century in these calendars may designate the years 0 to 99 as the 1st century, years 100 to 199 as the second etc. However, in order to regard 2000 as the first year of the [[21st century]] according to the astronomical year numbering, the astronomical year 0 has to correspond to the Gregorian year 1 BC.

==Alternative naming systems==
In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], besides the ordinal naming of centuries another system is often used based on the hundreds part of the year, and consequently centuries start at even multiples of 100. For example, Swedish ''nittonhundratalet'' (or ''1900-talet''), Danish and Norwegian ''nittenhundredetallet'' (or '' 1900-tallet'') and Finnish ''tuhatyhdeksänsataaluku'' (or ''1900-luku'') refer unambiguously to the years 1900–1999. The same system is used informally in English. For example, the years 1900–1999 are sometimes referred to as the ''nineteen hundreds'' (''1900s''). This is similar to the English decade names (''1980s'', meaning the years 1980–1989).
