[[Image:Major events in mitosis.svg|right|thumb|350px|Each turn of the cell cycle divides the [[chromosome]]s in a [[cell nucleus]].]]

'''The'''  '''cell cycle''', or '''cell-division cycle''', is the series of events that take place in a [[cell (biology)|cell]] leading to its division and duplication (replication). In cells without a nucleus ([[prokaryotic]]), the cell cycle occurs via a process termed [[binary fission]]. In cells with a nucleus ([[eukaryotes]]), the cell cycle can be divided in three periods: [[interphase]]—during which the cell grows, accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis and [[DNA replication|duplicating its DNA]]—and the mitotic (M) phase, during which the cell splits itself into two distinct cells, often called "daughter cells" and the final phase, cytokinesis, where the new cell is completely divided. The cell-division cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled [[fertilized egg]] develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which [[hair]], [[skin]], [[blood cell]]s, and some [[viscus|internal organs]] are renewed.

After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the [[interphase]] of a new cycle. Although the various stages of interphase are not usually morphologically distinguishable, each phase of the cell cycle has a distinct set of specialized biochemical processes that prepare the cell for initiation of cell division.

==G<sub>0</sub> phase==

The term "post-mitotic" is sometimes used to refer to both [[G0 phase|quiescent]] and [[Senescence#Cellular senescence|senescent]] cells. Nonproliferative cells in multicellular [[eukaryote]]s generally enter the quiescent G<sub>0</sub> state from G<sub>1</sub> and may remain quiescent for long periods of time, possibly indefinitely (as is often the case for [[neuron]]s). This is very common for cells that are fully [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]]. Cellular senescence occurs in response to DNA damage or degradation that would make a cell's progeny nonviable; it is often a biochemical reaction; division of such a cell could, for example, become cancerous. Some cells enter the G<sub>0</sub> phase semi-permanentally e.g., some liver and kidney cells.Many cells do not enter G0 and continue to divide throughout an organism's life, e.g. epithelial cells.

==Interphase==

Before a cell can enter cell division, it needs to take in nutrients. All of the preparations are done during interphase. Interphase is a series of changes that takes place in a newly formed cell and its nucleus, before it becomes capable of division again. It is also called preparatory phase or intermitosis. Previously it was called resting stage because there is no apparent activity related to cell division.Typically interphase lasts for at least 90% of the total time required for the cell cycle.

Interphase proceeds in three stages, G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub>, preceded by the previous cycle of mitosis and cytokinesis. The most significant event is the replication of genetic material (DNA) in S phase.

===G<sub>1</sub> Phase===

The first phase within interphase, from the end of the previous M phase until the beginning of DNA synthesis, is called [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub>]] (G indicating ''gap''). It is also called the growth phase. During this phase the biosynthetic activities of the cell, which are considerably slowed down during M phase, resume at a high rate. This phase is marked by the use of 20 amino acids to form millions of proteins and later on enzymes that are required in S phase, mainly those needed for DNA replication. Duration of G<sub>1</sub> is highly variable, even among different cells of the same species. It is under the control of the p53 gene.We can say that in this phase, cell increases its supply of proteins, increases the number of organelles (such as mitochondria, ribosomes), and grows in size.

===S Phase===

The ensuing [[S phase]] starts when [[DNA]] replication commences; when it is complete, all of the [[chromosome]]s have been replicated, i.e., each chromosome has two (sister) [[chromatid]]s. Thus, during this phase, the amount of DNA in the cell has effectively doubled, though the [[ploidy]] of the cell remains the same. During this phase, synthesis is completed as quickly as possible due to the exposed base pairs being sensitive to harmful external factors such as mutagens.

=== Mitosis (M phase, mitotic phase) ===
<!--[[Mitotic phase]] and [[M phase]] redirect here-->
{{Main|Mitosis}}
The relatively brief ''M phase'' consists of nuclear division ([[karyokinesis]]).It is a relatively short period of the cell cycle. M phase is complex and highly regulated. The sequence of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next. These phases are sequentially known as:
* [[prophase]],
* [[metaphase]],
* [[anaphase]],
* [[telophase]]
* [[cytokinesis]] (strictly speaking, cytokinesis is not part of mitosis but is an event that directly follows mitosis in which cytoplasm is divided into two daughter cells)

'''Mitosis''' is the process by which a [[eukaryotic]] cell separates the [[chromosome]]s in its [[cell nucleus]] into two identical sets in two nuclei.<ref>Rubenstein, Irwin, and Susan M. Wick. "Cell." World Book Online Reference Center. 2008. 12 January 2008 <http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar102240></ref> During the process of mitosis the pairs of [[chromosomes]] condense and attach to fibers that pull the [[sister chromatids]] to opposite sides of the cell.<ref>{{cite book | last = Maton | first = Anthea | authorlink = | coauthors = Hopkins, Jean Johnson, Susan LaHart, David, Quon Warner, David, Wright, Jill D | title = Cells: Building Blocks of Life | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 1997 | location = New Jersey | pages = 70–4 | isbn = 0-13-423476-6 }}</ref> It is generally followed immediately by [[cytokinesis]], which divides the nuclei, [[cytoplasm]], [[organelle]]s and [[cell membrane]] into two cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the '''mitotic (M) phase''' of the cell cycle - the [[cell division|division]] of the mother cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical to each other and to their parent cell. This accounts for approximately 10% of the cell cycle.

Mitosis occurs exclusively in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, but occurs in different ways in different species. For example, [[animal]]s undergo an "open" mitosis, where the [[nuclear envelope]] breaks down before the chromosomes separate, while [[fungi]] such as ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' and ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' ([[yeast]]) undergo a "closed" mitosis, where chromosomes divide within an intact [[cell nucleus]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=De Souza CP, Osmani SA |title=Mitosis, not just open or closed |journal=Eukaryotic Cell |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=1521–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17660363 |doi=10.1128/EC.00178-07 |pmc=2043359}}</ref> [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells, which lack a nucleus, divide by a process called [[binary fission]].

Because cytokinesis usually occurs in conjunction with mitosis, "mitosis" is often used interchangeably with "M phase". However, there are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei in a process called [[endoreplication]]. This occurs most notably among the [[fungus|fungi]] and [[slime mould]]s, but is found in various groups. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] embryonic development.<ref name=Lilly>{{cite journal | author = Lilly M, Duronio R | title = New insights into cell cycle control from the Drosophila endocycle | journal = Oncogene | volume = 24 | issue = 17 | pages = 2765–75 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15838513 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1208610}}</ref> Errors in mitosis can either kill a cell through [[apoptosis]] or cause [[mutation]]s that may lead to [[cancer]].

==Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle==
Regulation of the cell cycle involves processes crucial to the survival of a cell, including the detection and repair of genetic damage as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division. The molecular events that control the cell cycle are ordered and directional; that is, each process occurs in a sequential fashion and it is impossible to "reverse" the cycle.

===Role of cyclins and CDKs===
[[File:Paul Nurse portrait.jpg|thumb|150px|Nobel Laureate Paul Nurse]]
Two key classes of regulatory molecules, [[cyclin]]s and [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s (CDKs), determine a cell's progress through the cell cycle.<ref name="pmid7575488">{{cite journal | author = Nigg EA | title = Cyclin-dependent protein kinases: key regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle | journal = BioEssays | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 471–80 | year = 1995 | month = June | pmid = 7575488 | doi = 10.1002/bies.950170603 | url = | issn = }}</ref> [[Leland H.

Cyclins form the regulatory subunits and CDKs the catalytic subunits of an activated [[heterodimer]]; cyclins have no catalytic activity and CDKs are inactive in the absence of a partner cyclin. When activated by a bound cyclin, CDKs perform a common biochemical reaction called [[phosphorylation]] that activates or inactivates target proteins to orchestrate coordinated entry into the next phase of the cell cycle. Different cyclin-CDK combinations determine the downstream proteins targeted. CDKs are constitutively expressed in cells whereas cyclins are synthesised at specific stages of the cell cycle, in response to various molecular signals.<ref name="Robbins">{{cite book |last= Robbins and Cotran |coauthors= Kumar, Abbas, Fausto |title= Pathological Basis of Disease |publisher= [[Elsevier]] |year= 2004 |isbn= 81-8147-528-3 }}</ref>

====General mechanism of cyclin-CDK interaction====
{{refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
Upon receiving a pro-mitotic extracellular signal, G<sub>1</sub> [[cyclin-CDK]] complexes become active to prepare the cell for S phase, promoting the expression of [[transcription factor]]s that in turn promote the expression of S cyclins and of enzymes required for [[DNA replication]]. The G<sub>1</sub> cyclin-CDK complexes also promote the degradation of molecules that function as S phase inhibitors by targeting them for [[ubiquitination]]. Once a protein has been ubiquitinated, it is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the [[proteasome]].

Active S cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate proteins that make up the [[pre-replication complex]]es assembled during G<sub>1</sub> phase on DNA [[origin of replication|replication origins]]. The phosphorylation serves two purposes: to activate each already-assembled pre-replication complex, and to prevent new complexes from forming. This ensures that every portion of the cell's [[genome]] will be replicated once and only once. The reason for prevention of gaps in replication is fairly clear, because daughter cells that are missing all or part of crucial genes will die. However, for reasons related to [[gene copy number]] effects, possession of extra copies of certain genes is also deleterious to the daughter cells.

Mitotic cyclin-CDK complexes, which are synthesized but inactivated during S and G<sub>2</sub> phases, promote the initiation of [[mitosis]] by stimulating downstream proteins involved in chromosome condensation and [[mitotic spindle]] assembly. A critical complex activated during this process is a [[ubiquitin ligase]] known as the [[anaphase-promoting complex]] (APC), which promotes degradation of structural proteins associated with the chromosomal [[kinetochore]]. APC also targets the mitotic cyclins for degradation, ensuring that telophase and cytokinesis can proceed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mahmoudi|first=Morteza|coauthors=et al.|title=Effect of Nanoparticles on the Cell Life Cycle|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2011|month=01|volume=111|issue=5|pages=3407–3432|doi=10.1021/cr1003166|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr1003166}}</ref>

====Specific action of cyclin-CDK complexes====
[[Cyclin D]] is the first cyclin produced in the cell cycle, in response to extracellular signals (e.g. [[growth factor]]s). Cyclin D binds to existing [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 4|CDK4]], forming the active cyclin D-CDK4 complex. Cyclin D-CDK4 complex in turn phosphorylates the [[retinoblastoma]] susceptibility protein ([[Retinoblastoma protein|Rb]]). The hyperphosphorylated Rb dissociates from the E2F/DP1/Rb complex (which was bound to the [[E2F]] responsive genes, effectively "blocking" them from transcription), activating E2F. Activation of E2F results in transcription of various genes like [[cyclin E]], [[cyclin A]], [[DNA polymerase]], [[thymidine kinase]], etc. Cyclin E thus produced binds to [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 2|CDK2]], forming the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, which pushes the cell from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase (G<sub>1</sub>/S, which initiates the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition.<ref name="isbn0-12-324719-5">{{cite book | author = Norbury C | authorlink = | editor = Hardie, D.

=== Inhibitors ===
[[Image:Signal transduction pathways.svg|300px|thumb|right|Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in [[apoptosis]], also known as "programmed cell death".]]
Two families of genes, the ''cip/kip'' family (''CDK interacting protein/Kinase inhibitory protein'') and the INK4a/ARF (''In''hibitor of ''K''inase 4/''A''lternative ''R''eading ''F''rame) prevent the progression of the cell cycle. Because these genes are instrumental in prevention of [[tumor]] formation, they are known as [[tumor suppressor]]s.

The '''''cip/kip'' family''' includes the genes [[p21]], [[p27 (gene)|p27]] and [[P57 (gene)|p57]]. They halt cell cycle in G<sub>1</sub> phase, by binding to, and inactivating, cyclin-CDK complexes. p21 is activated by [[p53]] (which, in turn, is triggered by DNA damage e.g. due to radiation). p27 is activated by Transforming Growth Factor of β ([[TGF β]]), a growth inhibitor.

The '''INK4a/ARF family''' includes [[p16 (gene)|p16<sup>INK4a</sup>]], which binds to CDK4 and arrests the cell cycle in G<sub>1</sub> phase, and [[p19ARF]] which prevents p53 degradation.

Synthetic inhibitors of [[Cdc25]] could also be useful for the arrest of cell cycle and therefore be useful as antineoplastic and anticancer agents.<ref name="ref 1">[http://pharmaxchange.info/presentations/cdc25.html Presentation on CDC25 PHOSPHATASES: A Potential Target for Novel Anticancer Agents]</ref>

===Transcriptional regulatory network===
Evidence suggests that a semi-autonomous transcriptional network acts in concert with the CDK-cyclin machinery to regulate the cell cycle. Several gene expression studies in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' have identified approximately 800 to 1200 genes that change expression over the course of the cell cycle;<ref name="pmid9843569" /><ref name="pramilaetal2006">{{cite journal | author = Pramila T, Wu W, Miles S, Breeden L | title = The Forkhead transcription factor Hcm1 regulates chromosome segregation genes and fills the S-phase gap in the transcriptional circuitry of the cell cycle | journal = Genes Dev | volume = 20| issue = 16 | pages = 2266–227 | year = 2006 | month = August | pmid = 16912276| pmc = 1553209| doi = 10.1101/gad.1450606 | issn = }}</ref><ref name="orlandoeta1nature2008">{{cite journal | author = Orlando DA, Lin CY, Bernard A, Wang JY, Socolar JES, Iversen ES, Hartemink AJ, Haase SB | title = Global control of cell-cycle transcription by coupled CDK and network oscillators | journal = Nature | volume = 453| issue = 453 | pages = 944–947 | year = 2008 | month = June | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.1038/nature06955 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7197/full/nature06955.html | issn = |bibcode = 2008Natur.453..944O }}</ref> they are transcribed at high levels at specific points in the cell cycle, and remain at lower levels throughout the rest of the cell cycle.

Many periodically expressed genes are driven by [[transcription factors]] that are also periodically expressed. One screen of single-gene knockouts identified 48 transcription factors (about 20% of all non-essential transcription factors) that show cell cycle progression defects.<ref name="whiteetal2009">{{cite journal | author = White MA, Riles L, Cohen BA | title = A systematic screen for transcriptional regulators of the yeast cell cycle | journal = Genetics | volume = 181 | issue = 2 | pages = 435–46 | year = 2009 | month = February | pmid = 19033152 | pmc = 2644938| doi = 10.1534/genetics.108.098145 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/181/2/435 | issn = }}</ref> Genome-wide studies using high throughput technologies have identified the transcription factors that bind to the promoters of yeast genes, and correlating these findings with temporal expression patterns have allowed the identification of transcription factors that drive phase-specific gene expression.<ref name="pramilaetal2006" /><ref name="leeetal2002">{{cite journal | author = Lee T, et. al | title = Transcriptional Regulatory Networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5594 | pages = 799–804 | year = 2002 | month = October| pmid = 12399584| pmc = | doi = 10.1126/science.1075090 | url = | issn = |bibcode = 2002Sci...298..799L }}</ref> The expression profiles of these transcription factors are driven by the transcription factors that peak in the prior phase, and computational models have shown that a CDK-autonomous network of these transcription factors is sufficient to produce steady-state oscillations in gene expression).<ref name="orlandoeta1nature2008" /><ref name="simonetal2001">{{cite journal | author = Simon I, et. al | title = Serial Regulation of Transcriptional Regulators in the Yeast Cell Cycle | journal = Cell | volume = 106 | issue = 6 | pages = 697–708 | year = 2001 | month = September | pmid = 11572776| pmc = | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00494-9 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WSN-442RRFR-7/2/47b2bb3b8e41c7ca6592599402cee9b5 | issn = }}</ref>

Experimental evidence also suggests that gene expression can oscillate with the period seen in dividing wild-type cells independently of the CDK machinery. Orlando ''et al.'' used microarrays to measure the expression of a set of 1,271 genes that they identified as periodic in both wild type cells and cells lacking all S-phase and mitotic cyclins (''clb1,2,3,4,5,6''). Of the 1,271 genes assayed, 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin-deficient cells at the same time as in the wild type cells, despite the fact that the cyclin-deficient cells arrest at the border between [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub>]] and [[S phase]]. However, 833 of the genes assayed changed behavior between the wild type and mutant cells, indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK-cyclin machinery. Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and wild type cells. These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK-cyclin oscillator, they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events.<ref name="orlandoeta1nature2008" /> Other work indicates that [[phosphorylation]], a post-translational modification, of cell cycle transcription factors by [[Cdk1]] may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly control timing of target genes (Ubersax ''et al.'' 2003; Sidorova ''et al.'' 1995; White ''et al.'' 2009).<ref name="whiteetal2009" /><ref name="sidorova1995">{{cite journal | author = Sidorova JM, Mikesell GE, Breeden LL | title = Cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Swi6 controls its nuclear localization | journal = Mol Biol Cell. | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 1641–1658 | year = 1995 | month = December | pmid = 8590795| pmc = 301322| doi = }}</ref><ref name="ubersaxetal2003">{{cite journal | author = Ubersax J, et. al | title = Targets of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 | journal = Nature | volume = 425 | issue = 6960| pages = 859–864 | year = 2003 | month = October | pmid = 14574415| pmc = | doi = 10.1038/nature02062| issn = | bibcode = 2003Natur.425..859U }}</ref>

While oscillatory transcription plays a key role in the progression of the yeast cell cycle, the CDK-cyclin machinery operates independently in the early embryonic cell cycle. Before the [[midblastula transition]], zygotic transcription does not occur and all needed proteins, such as the B-type cyclins, are translated from maternally loaded [[mRNA]].<ref name="davidmorganbook2007">{{cite book | author = Morgan DO | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Cell Cycle: Principles of Control | edition = | language = | publisher = New Science Press | location = London | year = 2007 | origyear = | pages = 18 | chapter = 2-3 | quote = | isbn = 0=9539181-2-2 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

== Checkpoints ==
{{Main|Cell cycle checkpoint}}

[[Cell cycle checkpoint]]s are used by the cell to monitor and regulate the progress of the cell cycle.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/274/5293/1664 | title= Cell Cycle Checkpoints: Preventing an Identity Crisis| author= Stephen J. Elledge| journal= Science | date= 6 December 1996 | volume=274 | issue=5293| pages= 1664–1672 | pmid = 8939848 | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5293.1664 |bibcode = 1996Sci...274.1664E }}</ref> Checkpoints prevent cell cycle progression at specific points, allowing verification of necessary phase processes and repair of [[DNA damage]]. The cell cannot proceed to the next phase until checkpoint requirements have been met.

Several checkpoints are designed to ensure that damaged or incomplete DNA is not passed on to daughter cells. Two main checkpoints exist: the [[Cell_cycle_checkpoint#Restriction_Checkpoint|G<sub>1</sub>/S checkpoint]] and the [[Cell cycle checkpoint#G2 Checkpoint|G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint]]. G<sub>1</sub>/S transition is a rate-limiting step in the cell cycle and is also known as [[restriction point]].<ref name="Robbins"/> An alternative model of the cell cycle response to DNA damage has also been proposed, known as the [[postreplication checkpoint]].

[[p53]] plays an important role in triggering the control mechanisms at both G<sub>1</sub>/S and G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoints.

== Role in tumor formation ==
A disregulation of the cell cycle components may lead to [[tumor]] formation. As mentioned above, when some genes like the cell cycle inhibitors, [[Retinoblastoma protein|RB]], [[p53]] etc. mutate, they may cause the cell to multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Although the duration of cell cycle in tumor cells is equal to or longer than that of normal cell cycle, the proportion of cells that are in active cell division (versus quiescent cells in G<sub>0</sub> phase) in tumors is much higher than that in normal tissue. Thus there is a net increase in cell number as the number of cells that die by apoptosis or senescence remains the same.

The cells which are actively undergoing cell cycle are targeted in cancer therapy as the DNA is relatively exposed during cell division and hence susceptible to damage by [[Chemotherapy|drugs]] or [[Radiotherapy|radiation]]. This fact is made use of in cancer treatment; by a process known as [[debulking]], a significant mass of the tumor is removed which pushes a significant number of the remaining tumor cells from G<sub>0</sub> to G<sub>1</sub> phase (due to increased availability of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors etc.). Radiation or chemotherapy following the debulking procedure kills these cells which have newly entered the cell cycle.<ref name="Robbins"/>

The fastest cycling mammalian cells in culture, crypt cells in the intestinal epithelium, have a cycle time as short as 9 to 10 hours. Stem cells in resting mouse skin may have a cycle time of more than 200 hours. Most of this difference is due to the varying length of G<sub>1</sub>, the most variable phase of the cycle. M and S do not vary much.

In general, cells are most radiosensitive in late M and G<sub>2</sub> phases and most resistant in late S.

For cells with a longer cell cycle time and a significantly long G<sub>1</sub> phase, there is a second peak of resistance late in G<sub>1</sub>.

The pattern of resistance and sensitivity correlates with the level of sulfhydryl compounds in the cell. Sulfhydryls are natural radioprotectors and tend to be at their highest levels in S and at their lowest near mitosis.
