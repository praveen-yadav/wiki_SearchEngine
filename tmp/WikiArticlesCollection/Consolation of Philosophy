'''''Consolation of Philosophy''''' ({{lang-la|'''Consolatio Philosophiae'''}}) is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] work by [[Boethius]], written around the year 524. It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West on [[Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] [[Christianity]], and is also the last great Western work of the Classical Period.<ref>''The Consolation of Philosophy (Oxford World's Classics)'', Introduction (2000)</ref><ref name="Dante Divine">[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] placed Boethius the “last of the Romans and first of the Scholastics” among the doctors in his Paradise (see ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'') (see also below).</ref>

''Consolation of Philosophy'' was written during a one-year imprisonment Boethius served while awaiting trial &ndash; and eventual horrific execution &ndash; for the crime of [[treason]] under the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] King [[Theodoric the Great]]. Boethius was at the very heights of power in [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and was brought down by treachery. This experience inspired the text, which reflects on how evil can exist in a world governed by God (the problem of [[theodicy]]), and how happiness can be attainable amidst fickle fortune, while also considering the nature of happiness and God. It has been described as "by far the most interesting example of [[prison literature]] the world has ever seen."<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02610b.htm ''Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius'']. The quote is commonly seen in a number of sources, but without attribution; the Catholic Encyclopedia article (by William Turner, 1907) is the oldest “known” citation found. In fact the phrase is originally from [http://archive.org/details/boethiusanessay00stewuoft ''Boethius, an essay''] (1891), by H. F. Stewart, [http://archive.org/stream/boethiusanessay00stewuoft#page/107/mode/1up page 107] (past paragraph).</ref>

Even though reference is often made to God, the book is not strictly religious. A link is often assumed, yet there is no reference made to Jesus Christ or Christianity or any other specific religion other than a few oblique references to Pauline scripture, such as the symmetry between the opening lines of Book 4 Chapter 3 and 1 Corinthians 9:24. God is however represented not only as an eternal and all-knowing being, but as the source of all Good.

Boethius writes the book as a conversation between himself and Lady Philosophy. She consoles Boethius by discussing the transitory nature of fame and wealth ("no man can ever truly be secure until he has been forsaken by Fortune"), and the ultimate superiority of things of the mind, which she calls the "one true good". She contends that happiness comes from within, and that one's virtue is all that one truly has, because it is not imperilled by the vicissitudes of fortune.

Boethius engages questions such as the nature of [[predestination]] and [[free will]], why [[Problem of evil|evil men often prosper and good men fall into ruin]], [[human nature]], [[virtue]], and [[justice]]. He speaks about the nature of free will versus [[determinism]] when he asks if God knows and sees all, or does man have free will. To quote V.E. Watts on Boethius, ''God is like a spectator at a chariot race; He watches the action the charioteers perform, but this does not cause them.''<ref>''The Consolation of Philosophy'' (Penguin Classics), Introduction, xxxi, 2000. ISBN 0-14-044780-6. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0140447806&id=tdoTDYYuWSoC&pg=PR31&lpg=PR31&ots=Bxcv4SRC4K&dq=%22God+is+like+a+spectator+at+a+chariot+race%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&sig=WsI8gtbOQNjDuTixQRDfGl08vhg]</ref> On human nature, Boethius says that humans are essentially good and only when they give in to “wickedness” do they “sink to the level of being an animal.” On justice, he says criminals are not to be abused, rather treated with sympathy and respect, using the analogy of doctor and patient to illustrate the ideal relationship between prosecutor and criminal.

In the ''Consolation'', Boethius answered religious questions without reference to Christianity, relying solely on natural philosophy and the Classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] tradition. He believed in the correspondence between faith and reason. The truths found in Christianity would be no different from the truths found in philosophy.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Chadwick| first = Henry | editor = Edward Craig| encyclopedia = Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | title = Boethius, Anicius Manlius Severinus (c.480-525/6)| year = 1998| publisher = Routledge|quote=The ''Opuscula sacra'' regard faith and reason as independent but parallel and compatible ways of attaining to higher metaphysical truths, and the independent validity of logical reasoning is also an underlying presupposition throughout ''De consolatione''.}}</ref> In the words of Henry Chadwick, "If the ''Consolation'' contains nothing distinctively Christian, it is also relevant that it contains nothing specifically pagan either...[it] is a work written by a Platonist who is also a Christian, but is not a Christian work."<ref>Henry Chadwick, ''Boethius: The Consolations of Music, Logic, Theology and Philosophy'', 1990, ISBN 0-19-826549-2</ref>

From the [[Carolingian]] epoch to the end of the Middle Ages and beyond, this was the most widely copied work of secular literature in Europe. It was one of the most popular and influential philosophical works, read by statesmen, poets, and historians, as well as of philosophers and theologians. It is through Boethius that much of the thought of the Classical period was made available to the Western Medieval world. It has often been said Boethius was the “last of the Romans and the first of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]”.<ref name="Dante Divine" />

The philosophical message of the book fits well with the religious piety of the Middle Ages. Readers were encouraged not to seek worldly goods such as money and power, but to seek internalized virtues. Evil had a purpose, to provide a lesson to help change for good; while suffering from evil was seen as virtuous. Because God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.<ref name="Beck">Sanderson Beck (1996).</ref> The Middle Ages, with their vivid sense of an overruling fate, found in Boethius an interpretation of life closely akin to the spirit of Christianity. The ''Consolation of Philosophy'' stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the pagan philosophy of [[Seneca the Younger]] and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref name=Cambridge>''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', [http://www.bartleby.com/211/0605.html Volume I Ch.6.5: ''De Consolatione Philosophiae''], 1907–1921.</ref>

The book is heavily influenced by [[Plato]] and his [[Socratic Dialogue|dialogues]] (as was Boethius himself).<ref name=Cambridge/> Its popularity can in part be explained by its [[neoplatonic]] and Christian ethical messages, although current scholarly research is still far from clear exactly why and how the work became so vastly popular in the Middle Ages. Notably, the book has not received much attention in the recent modern era, possibly in part because of its foreign inward looking virtues and rejection of the modern emphasis on material productiveness.<ref name="Beck" /> As Sanderson Beck says of the Middle Ages:

[[Image:ForutuneWheel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lady Fortune]] with [[Rota Fortunae|the Wheel of Fortune]] in a medieval manuscript of a work by [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]; ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was responsible for the popularity of the goddess of Fortune and the wheel of fortune in the Middle Ages]]

: “Who can say that this inward period of humanity did not prepare the way for the productiveness of the Renaissance like a person quiets one's consciousness in contemplation and prayer before creating a great work of art or literature or science? The Middle Ages were difficult times politically and economically, but who can estimate how much happiness they inwardly received from the Consolation of Philosophy?”.<ref name="Beck" />

Translations into the [[vernacular]] were done by famous notables, including [[King Alfred]] ([[Old English language|Old English]]), [[Jean de Meun]] ([[Old French]]), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] ([[Middle English]]), [[Queen Elizabeth I]] ([[Early Modern English]]), and [[Notker Labeo]] ([[Old High German]]).

Found within ''Consolation'' are themes that have echoed throughout the Western canon: the female figure of wisdom that informs Dante, the ascent through the layered universe that is shared with Milton, the reconciliation of opposing forces that find their way into Chaucer in The Knight's Tale, and the Wheel of Fortune so popular throughout the Middle Ages.

Citations from it occur frequently in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divina Commedia]]''. Of Boethius, Dante remarked ''“The blessed soul who exposes the deceptive world to anyone who gives ear to him.”<ref>''Dante ''The Divine Comedy''. “blessed souls” inhabit Dante's Paradise, and appear as flames. (see note above).</ref>

Boethian influence can be found nearly everywhere in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s poetry, e.g. in ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'', ''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'', ''[[The Franklin's Tale]]'', ''[[The Parson's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'', in the character of Lady Nature in ''[[The Parliament of Fowls]]'' and some of the shorter poems, such as ''Truth'', ''The Former Age'' and ''Lak of Stedfastnesse''. Chaucer translated the work in his ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''.

The [[Italians|Italian]] composer [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] used some of the text in his choral work ''[[Canti di prigionia]]'' (1938).  The [[Australia]]n composer [[Peter Sculthorpe]] quoted parts of it in his opera or music theatre work ''[[Rites of Passage (Sculthorpe)|Rites of Passage]]'' (1972–73), which was commissioned for the opening of the [[Sydney Opera House]] but was not ready in time.

[[Tom Shippey]] in ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' says how “Boethian” much of the treatment of evil is in [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Shippey says that Tolkien knew well the translation of Boethius that was made by King Alfred and he quotes some “Boethian” remarks from [[Frodo]], [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].<ref>Tom Shippey, ''The Road to Middle-earth'', pg. 140, ISBN 0-395-33973-1, (1983).</ref>

Boethius and ''Consolatio Philosophiae'' are cited frequently by the main character Ignatius J. Reilly in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'' (1980).

Boethius is also referenced in the 2002 film ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'', when Tony Wilson's character is recited an excerpt of "The Consolation of Philosophy" by a panhandler to whom he has just given pocket change. This reference is related to viewing history as a wheel, with the fortunes of man rising and falling as cyclically as its spokes. It speaks largely to the wheel's allegorical metaphor to the vicissitudes of life. 

It is a [[prosimetrum|prosimetrical]] text, meaning that it is written in alternating sections of [[prose]] and metered [[Meter (poetry)|verse]]. In the course of the text, Boethius displays a virtuosic command of the forms of [[Latin poetry]]. It is classified as a [[Menippean satire]], a fusion of [[allegory|allegorical]] tale, [[platonic dialogue]], and lyrical poetry.

In the 20th century there were close to four hundred manuscripts still surviving, a testament to its former popularity.
