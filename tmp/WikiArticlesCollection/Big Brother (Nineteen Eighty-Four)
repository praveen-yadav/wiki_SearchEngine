{{DISPLAYTITLE:Big Brother (''Nineteen Eighty-Four'')}}[[File:Telescreen.png|thumb|right|350px|Big Brother's face looms from giant telescreens in Victory Square in [[Michael Radford]]'s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (film)|1984 film adaptation]] of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.]]

'''Big Brother''' is a fictional character in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. He is the enigmatic dictator of [[Oceania (1984)|Oceania]], a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state taken to its utmost logical consequence – where the ruling Party wields total power for its own sake over the inhabitants.

In the society that Orwell describes, everyone is under complete [[surveillance]] by the authorities, mainly by [[telescreen]]s. The people are constantly reminded of this by the phrase "Big Brother is watching you", which is the core "truth" of the propaganda system in this state. 

Since the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the term "Big Brother" has entered the [[lexicon]] as a synonym for abuse of government power, particularly in respect to [[civil liberties]], often specifically related to [[mass surveillance]].

==Purported origins==
In the essay section of his novel ''[[1985 (Anthony Burgess novel)|1985]]'', [[Anthony Burgess]] states that Orwell got the idea for Big Brother from advertising billboards for educational [[correspondence course]]s from a company called ''Bennett's'', current during [[World War II]]. The original posters showed J. M. Bennett himself; a kindly looking old man offering guidance and support to would-be students with the phrase "Let me be your father" attached. After Bennett's death, his son took over the company, and the posters were replaced with pictures of the son (who looked imposing and stern in contrast to his father's kindly demeanour) with the text "Let me be your big brother."

Additional speculation from Douglas Kellner of [[UCLA]] argued that Big Brother represents [[Joseph Stalin]] and that the novel portrayed life under [[totalitarian]]ism.<ref>[http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/index.html Douglas Kellner]</ref><ref>[http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/from1984toonedimensional.pdf From 1984 to One-Dimensional Man: Critical Reflections on Orwell and Marcuse]</ref>

==Appearance in the novel==

===Existence===
In the novel it is not clear whether Big Brother was ever a real person or a fiction invented by [[Ingsoc|the Party]] to personify itself.

In Party propaganda Big Brother is presented as a real person: one of the founders of the Party, along with [[Emmanuel Goldstein|Goldstein]]. At one point in ''1984'' Winston Smith, the protagonist of Orwell's novel, tries "to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London..." In the year 1984 Big Brother appears on posters and telescreens as a handsome man in his mid-40s. If the man who came to be known as Big Brother was indeed one of the leaders of the revolution, he is very probably long dead.

When Winston Smith is later arrested, [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]] describes Big Brother as a figure who will never die. When Smith asks if Big Brother exists, O'Brien describes him as "the embodiment of the Party" and that he will exist as long as the Party exists.  When Winston follows up his question by asking "Does Big Brother exist the same way I do?", O'Brien replies "You do not exist."

===Cult of personality===
A spontaneous ritual of devotion to Big Brother ("BB") is illustrated at the end of the "[[Two Minutes Hate]]":

{{quote|
At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmic chant of 'B-B! .... B-B! .... B-B!'—over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'B' and the second—a heavy murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamps of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.  For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up.  It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion.  Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.<ref>Orwell, George (1949). Nineteen Eighty-Four.</ref>}}

Though Oceania's [[Ministry of Truth]], [[Ministry of Plenty]], and [[Ministry of Peace]] each have names with meanings deliberately opposite to their real purpose, the [[Ministry of Love]] is perhaps the most straightforward: "rehabilitated thought criminals" leave the Ministry as loyal subjects who have been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] into genuinely loving Big Brother.

==Legacy==
Since the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' the phrase "Big Brother" has come into common use to describe any prying or overly-controlling authority figure, and attempts by government to increase surveillance.

Ukrainian-American comedian [[Yakov Smirnoff]] makes frequent reference to both Big Brother and other [[Orwellian]] traits in his [[Russian Reversal]] jokes.

The magazine ''Book'' ranked Big Brother No. 59 on its 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900<ref>{{cite web|author=Christine Paik |url=http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html |title=100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900 |publisher=NPR |date=2002-03-19 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref> list. ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine rated him the 75th greatest villain of all time.<ref>''Wizard'' #177</ref>

The worldwide reality television show ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' is based on the novel's concept of people being under constant [[surveillance]]. In 2000, after the [[Big Brother (U.S.)|U.S. version]] of the [[CBS]] program "Big Brother" premiered, the Estate of George Orwell sued CBS and its production company "Orwell Productions, Inc." in federal court in Chicago for copyright and trademark infringement. The case was ''Estate of Orwell v. CBS'', 00-c-5034 (ND Ill). On the eve of trial, the case settled worldwide to the parties' "mutual satisfaction"; the amount that CBS paid to the Orwell Estate was not disclosed. CBS had not asked the Estate for permission. Under current laws the novel will remain under [[copyright]] protection until 2020 in the European Union and until 2044 in the United States.

The iconic image of Big Brother (played by David Graham) played a key role in [[Apple Computers|Apple]]'s [[1984 (advertisement)|1984 television commercial]] introducing the [[Macintosh]].<ref>[http://www.zdnet.com/news/remembering-the-1984-super-bowl-mac-ad/263647 Remembering the '1984' Super Bowl Mac ad] ZDNet, 23 January 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/09/iconic_apple_ad_gets_doubletwi.html Apple's 'Big Brother' sequel] BBC News, 30 September 2009</ref> The Orwell Estate viewed the Apple commercial as a copyright infringement, and sent a cease-and-desist letter to Apple and its advertising agency.

The December 2002 issue of ''[[Gear (magazine)|Gear]]'' magazine featured a story about technologies and trends that could violate personal privacy moving society closer to a "Big Brother" state and utilised a recreation of the movie poster<ref>http://www.dallmeierart.com/user/cimage/244493fb0.jpg</ref> from the film version of ''1984'' created by Dallmeierart.com.<ref>[http://www.dallmeierart.com/bigbrother.htm Big Brother is Watching You – George Orwell 1984 Movie Prop Print DallmeierArt.com]</ref>

In 2011, media analyst and political activist [[Mark Dice]] published a non-fiction book titled ''Big Brother: The Orwellian Nightmare Come True'' which analyses the parallels between elements of the storyline in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', and current government programs, technology, and cultural trends.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Big-Brother-Orwellian-Nightmare-Come/dp/0967346614 Big Brother: The Orwellian Nightmare Come True Amazon.com]</ref>
