The '''cuisine of the United States''' refers to food preparation originating from the [[United States|United States of America]]. [[European colonization of the Americas]] yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter. The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of immigrants from many foreign nations; such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country.

==History==
===Pre-Colonial cuisine===
====Seafood====
Seafood in the United States originated with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who often ate [[Cod (food)|cod]], [[lemon sole]], [[flounder]], [[Herring (food)|herring]], [[halibut]], [[sturgeon]], [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]], [[drum (fish)|drum]] on the East Coast, and [[Oily fish|olachen]] and salmon on the West Coast. Whale was hunted by Native Americans off the Northwest coast, especially by the [[Makah people|Makah]], and used for their meat and oil.<ref>[http://ncseonline.org/nae/docs/makahfaq.html A Fact Sheet Issued by the Makah Whaling Commission]</ref> Seal and walrus were also eaten, in addition to eel from New York's [[Finger Lakes]] region. [[Catfish]] was also popular amongst native peoples, including the [[Modoc people|Modocs]]. Crustacean included [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]], [[lobster]], [[Crayfish (food)|crayfish]], and [[dungeness crab]]s in the Northwest and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]]s in the East. Other shellfish include [[abalone]] and [[geoduck]] on the West Coast, while on the East Coast the [[surf clam]], [[quahog]], and the [[soft-shell clam]]. [[Oyster]]s were eaten on both shores, as were [[mussel]]s and [[Common periwinkle|periwinkle]]s.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=21,22}}</ref>

====Cooking methods====
[[Image:Blue crab on market in Piraeus - Callinectes sapidus Rathbun 20020819-317.jpg|thumb|right|[[Callinectes sapidus|Blue crab]] was used on the eastern and southern coast of what is now the U.S. mainland.]]
Early Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American Cuisine that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form the basis of American Cuisine. [[Grilling]] meats was common. [[Spit roast]]ing over a pit fire was common as well. Vegetables, especially [[root vegetable]]s were often cooked directly in the ashes of the fire. As early Native Americans lacked  pottery that could be used directly over a fire, they developed a technique which has caused many [[anthropologist]]s to call them "[[Stone Boilers]]". They would heat rocks directly in a fire and then add the bricks to a pot filled with water until it came to a boil so that it would cook the meat or vegetables in the boiling water. In what is now the Southwestern United States, they also created [[adobe]] ovens called [[horno]]s  to bake items such as [[cornmeal]] breads, and in other parts of America, made ovens of dug pits. These pits were also used to steam foods by adding heated rocks or embers and then seaweed or corn husks placed on top to steam fish and shellfish as well as vegetables; potatoes would be added while still in-skin and corn while in-husk, this would later be referred to as a [[New England clam bake|clambake]] by the colonists.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=31,32}}</ref>

===Colonial period===
{{Main|Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies}}
[[Image:Map of territorial  growth 1775.svg|thumb|left|200px|Map of the 13 American Colonies in 1775.]]

When the [[colonist]]s came to [[History of Virginia|Virginia]], [[History of Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], or any of the other English colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America, their initial attempts at survival included planting [[crop]]s familiar to them from back home in England. In the same way, they farmed animals for clothing and meat in a similar fashion. Through hardships and eventual establishment of trade with Britain, the [[West Indies]] and other regions, the colonists were able to establish themselves in the American colonies with a cuisine similar to their previous [[British cuisine]]. There were some exceptions to the diet, such as local vegetation and animals, but the colonists attempted to use these items in the same fashion as they had their equivalents or ignore them entirely if they could. The manner of cooking for the American colonists followed along the line of British cookery up until the Revolution. The British sentiment followed in the cookbooks brought to the New World as well.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=512}}.</ref>

There was a general disdain for [[French cuisine|French]] cookery, even with the French [[Huguenot]]s in [[South Carolina]] and French-Canadians. One of the cookbooks that proliferated in the colonies was [[The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy]] written by [[Hannah Glasse]], wrote of disdain for the French style of cookery, stating “the blind folly of this age that would rather be imposed on by a French booby, than give encouragement to a good English cook!” Of the French recipes, she does add to the text she speaks out flagrantly against the dishes as she “… think it an odd jumble of trash.”<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Glasse|1750}}.</ref> Reinforcing the anti-French sentiment was the [[French and Indian War]] from 1754–1764. This created a large anxiety against the French, which influenced the English to either deport many of the French, or as in the case of the [[Acadian]]s, they migrated to [[Louisiana]]. The Acadian French did create a large French influence in the diet of those settled in Louisiana, but had little or no influence outside of Louisiana.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=512, Vol. 1}}.</ref>

====Common ingredients====
The American colonial diet varied depending on the settled region in which someone lived. Local cuisine patterns had established by the mid-18th century. The [[New England]] colonies were extremely similar in their dietary habits to those that many of them had brought from England. A striking difference for the colonists in New England compared to other regions was seasonality.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Oliver|2005|pp=16–19}}.</ref> While in the southern colonies, they could farm almost year round, in the northern colonies, the growing seasons were very restricted. In addition, colonists’ close proximity to the ocean gave them a bounty of fresh fish to add to their diet, especially in the northern colonies. [[Wheat]], however, the grain used to bake bread back in England was almost impossible to grow, and imports of wheat were far from cost productive.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|p=25}}.</ref> Substitutes in cases such as this included cornmeal. The [[Johnnycake]] was a poor substitute to some for wheaten bread, but acceptance by both the northern and southern colonies seems evident.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Oliver|2005|p=22}}.</ref>

As many of the New Englanders were originally from England game hunting was often a pastime from back home that paid off when they immigrated to the [[New World]]. Much of the northern colonists depended upon the ability either of themselves to hunt, or for others from which they could purchase game. This was the preferred method for protein consumption over animal husbandry, as it required much more work to defend the kept animals against Native Americans or the French.

=====Livestock and game=====
Commonly hunted game included deer, bear,[[American bison|buffalo]] and wild turkey. The larger muscles of the animals were roasted and served with currant sauce, while the other smaller portions went into [[soup]]s, [[stew]]s, [[sausage]]s, [[pie]]s, and pasties.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|pp=546–547, Vol. 1}}.</ref> In addition to game, colonists' protein intake was supplemented by [[mutton]]. The [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in [[Florida]] originally introduced [[sheep]] to the New World, but this development never quite reached the North, and there they were introduced by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and English. The keeping of sheep was a result of the English non-practice of [[animal husbandry]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=26, Vol. 2}}.</ref> The animals provided wool when young and mutton upon maturity after wool production was no longer desirable.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Root|De Rochemont|1981|pp=176–182}}</ref> The forage-based diet for sheep that prevailed in the Colonies produced a characteristically strong, gamy flavor and a tougher consistency, which required aging and slow cooking to tenderize.<ref>{{cite news |first=R.W. |last=Apple Jr. |title=Much Ado About Mutton, but Not in These Parts |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/29/dining/29mutt.html |work= [[New York Times]] |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=2008-01-23 |quote=Until it fell from favor after World War II, it was a favorite of most Britons, who prized mutton (defined there as the meat from sheep at least 2 years old) above lamb (from younger animals) for its texture and flavor. It has a bolder taste, a deeper color and a chewier consistency.}}</ref>

=====Fats and oils=====
A number of [[fat]]s and [[oil]]s made from animals served to cook much of the colonial foods. Many homes had a sack made of deerskin filled with bear oil for cooking, while solidified bear fat resembled [[shortening]]. Rendered [[pork]] fat made the most popular cooking medium, especially from the cooking of [[bacon]]. Pork fat was used more often in the southern colonies than the northern colonies as the Spanish introduced pigs earlier to the South. The colonists enjoyed [[butter]] in cooking as well, but it was rare prior to the [[American Revolution]], as [[cattle]] were not yet plentiful.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|pp=458–459, Vol. 2}}.</ref>

=====Alcoholic drinks=====
Prior to the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], New Englanders consumed large quantities of [[rum]] and [[beer]], as maritime trade provided them relatively easy access to the goods needed to produce these items: Rum was the distilled spirit of choice, as the main ingredient, [[molasses]], was readily available from trade with the West Indies. Further into the interior, however, one would often find colonists consuming [[whiskey]], as they did not have similar access to [[sugar cane]]. They did have ready access to corn and rye, which they used to produce their whiskey.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|p=17}}.</ref> However, until the Revolution, many considered whiskey to be a coarse alcohol unfit for human consumption, as many believed that it caused the poor to become raucous and unkempt drunkards.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Crowgey|1971|pp=18–19}}.</ref> In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, imports were seen on merchant shelves, including [[wine]] and [[brandy]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|p=18}}.</ref>

=====Southern variations=====
In comparison to the northern colonies, the southern colonies were quite diverse in their agricultural diet and did not have a central region of culture. The uplands and the lowlands made up the two main parts of the southern colonies. The slaves and poor of the south often ate a similar diet, which consisted of many of the indigenous New World crops. Salted or smoked pork often supplement the vegetable diet. Rural poor often ate [[squirrel]], [[Opossum|possum]], [[rabbit]] and other woodland animals. Those on the “rice coast” often ate ample amounts of [[rice]], while the grain for the rest of the southern poor and slaves was [[cornmeal]] used in [[bread]]s and [[porridge]]s. Wheat was not an option for most of those that lived in the southern colonies.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|pp=34–35}}.</ref>

The diet of the uplands often included [[cabbage]], [[Green bean|string beans]], white [[potato]]es, while most avoided [[sweet potato]]es and [[peanut]]s. Well-off whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because of the perceived inferiority of crops of the African slaves. Those who could grow or afford wheat often had biscuits as part of their [[breakfast]], along with healthy portions of pork. Salted pork was a staple of any meal, as it was used in the preparations of vegetables for flavor, in addition to being eaten directly as a protein.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|pp=47–48}}.</ref>

The lowlands, which included much of the Acadian French regions of Louisiana and the surrounding area, included a varied diet heavily influenced by Africans and Caribbeans, rather than just the French. As such, rice played a large part of the diet as it played a large part of the diets of the Africans and Caribbean. In addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands subsistence of protein came mostly from coastal seafood and game meats. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still does today.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pillsbury|1998|pp=48–49}}.</ref> Interestingly, although the English had an inherent disdain for French foodways, as well as many of the native foodstuff of the colonies, the French had no such disdain for the indigenous foodstuffs. In fact, they had a vast appreciation for the native ingredients and dishes.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|p=149, Vol. 2}}.</ref>

===Post-colonial cuisine===
During the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans developed many new foods. Some, such as [[Rocky Mountain oyster]]s, stayed regional; some spread throughout the nation but with little international appeal, such as [[peanut butter]] (a core ingredient of the famous [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]]); and some spread throughout the world, such as the [[cookie]], [[popcorn]], [[Coca-Cola]] and its competitors, [[fried chicken]], [[cornbread]], unleavened [[muffin]]s such as the [[poppyseed muffin]], and [[brownies]].

===Modern cuisine===
[[File:Chico's All Stars.jpg|thumb|right|A restaurant dish consisting of smaller versions of three different hamburgers available in the restaurant, each with different toppings, accompanied with French fries, coleslaw, [[jalapeños]], ketchup and sweet chili sauce.]]

During the [[Progressive Era]] (1890s–1920s) food production and presentation became more industrialized. Major railroads featured upscale cuisine in their dining cars.<ref>James D. Porterfield, ''Dining by Rail: The History and Recipes of America's Golden Age of Railroad Cuisine'' (1993) </ref>  Restaurant chains emerged with standardized decore and menus, most famously the [[Fred Harvey Company|Fred Harvey]] restaurants along the route of the Sante Fe Railroad in the Southwest.<ref>Stephen Fried, ''Appetite for America: How Visionary Businessman Fred Harvey Built a Railroad Hospitality Empire That Civilized the Wild West'' (Bantam; 2010)</ref> 

At the universities nutritionists and home economists taught a new scientific approach to food. During World War I the Progressives' moral advice about food conservation was emphasized in large-scale state and federal programs designed to educate housewives. Large-scale foreign aid during and after the war brought American standards to Europe.<ref>Helen Zoe Veit, ''Modern Food, Moral Food: Self-Control, Science, and the Rise of Modern American Eating in the Early Twentieth Century'' (2013)</ref>

Newspapers and magazines ran recipe columns, aided by research by corporate kitchens (for example, [[General Mills]], [[Campbell's]], [[Kraft Foods]]).  One characteristic of American cooking is the [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] of multiple ethnic or regional approaches into completely new cooking styles. Hamburgers and hot dogs from German cuisine, spaghetti and pizza from Italian cuisine became popular.  Since the 1960s Asian cooking has played a particularly large role in American fusion cuisine.<ref>[http://www.asian-nation.org/asian-food.shtml Asian Cuisine & Foods]</ref>

[[File:NCI Visuals Food Hot Dog.jpg|thumb|left|An American [[hot dog]]]]
Similarly, some dishes that are typically considered American have their origins in other countries. American cooks and chefs have substantially altered these dishes over the years, to the degree that the dishes now enjoyed around the world are considered to be American. [[Hot dog]]s and [[hamburger]]s are both based on traditional [[German cuisine|German]] dishes, but in their modern popular form they can be reasonably considered American dishes.<ref>[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art10695.asp Hamburgers & Hot Dogs – All-American Food]</ref> 

[[Pizza]] is based on the traditional [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] dish, brought by Italian immigrants to the United States, but varies highly in style based on the region of development since it's arrival (a "Chicago" style has focus on a thicker, more bread-like crust, whereas a "New York Slice" is known to have a much thinner crust, for example) and these types can be advertised throughout the country and are generally recognizable/well-known (with some restaurants going so far as to import New York City tap water from a thousand or more miles away to recreate the signature style in other regions).<ref>[http://www.eddieandsamspizza.com/index.php Eddie and Sams Pizza of Tampa, FL]</ref> 

Many companies in the American [[food industry]] develop new products requiring minimal preparation, such as frozen entrees.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/business/13conagra.html ConAgra’s Chief Is Moving to Revitalizny's products]</ref> Many of these recipes have become very popular. For example, the General Mills ''Betty Crocker's Cookbook'', first published in 1950 and currently in its 10th edition,<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Crocker|2005}}.</ref> is commonly found in American homes.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20071003/ai_n21022934 Face value: Fictional Betty Crocker gives big business a human touch]</ref>

A wave of [[celebrity chef]]s began perhaps with [[Julia Child]] and [[Graham Kerr]] in the 1970s, with many more following after the rise of cable channels like [[Food Network]]. Trendy food items in the 2000s and 2010s (albeit with long traditions) include doughnuts, [[cupcake]]s, [[macaroon]]s, and [[meatball]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/12/04/143107390/meatballs-a-happy-food-in-hard-times|agency=NPR|date=2011-12-04|accessdate=2012-01-04|title=Meatballs: A Happy Food In Hard Times|author=Bonny Wolf}}</ref>

==Regional cuisines==
{{Main|List of American regional and fusion cuisines}}
Given the United States's large size, numerous regions each have their own distinctive cuisines, all quite diverse.

===New England===
{{Main|Cuisine of New England}}
[[Image:Quail 07 bg 041506.jpg|thumb|New England [[clam chowder]]]]
New England is a Northeastern region of the United States, including the six states of [[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]]. The Native American cuisine became part of the cookery style that the early colonists brought with them.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} The style of New England cookery originated from its colonial roots, that is to say practical, frugal and willing to eat anything other than what they were used to from their British roots.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Smith|2004|pp=181–182}}.</ref> Much of the cuisine started with one-pot cookery, which resulted in such dishes as [[succotash]], [[chowder]], [[baked beans]], and others.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Danforth|Feierabend|Chassman|1998|p=13}}</ref>

Lobster is an integral ingredient to the cuisine, indigenous to the coastal waters of the region. Other [[shellfish]] of the coastal regions include [[Cherrystone clam#Alternative names|little neck clam]]s, [[Scallop|sea scallop]]s, [[blue mussel]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[Soft-shell clam|soft shell clam]]s and [[Atlantic jackknife clam|razor shell clam]]s. Much of this shellfish contributes to New England tradition, the [[New England clam bake|clambake]]. The clambake as known today is a colonial interpretation of an American Indian tradition.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Danforth|Feierabend|Chassman|1998|pp=12–19}}</ref>

The fruits of the region include the ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'' grapes used in [[grape juice]] made by companies such as [[Welch's]], along with [[Fruit preserves|jelly]], [[Kosher wine]] by companies like [[Mogen David]] and [[Manischewitz]] along with other wineries that make higher quality wines. [[Apple]]s from New England include the original varieties Baldwin, Lady, Mother, Pomme Grise, Porter, Roxbury Russet, Wright, Sops of Wine, Peck's Pleasant, Titus Pippin, Westfield-Seek-No-Further, and Duchess of Oldenburg. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] are another fruit indigenous to the region.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Danforth|Feierabend|Chassman|1998|pp=24–26}}</ref>

===Pacific and Hawaiian cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Hawaii}}
[[File:Bali Hai seared ahi.jpg|thumb|[[Hawaiian cuisine]]: Seared ahi with [[wasabi]] [[beurre blanc]] sauce]]

[[Hawaii regional cuisine|Hawaiian regional cuisine]] covers everything from wok-charred ahi tuna, opakapaka (snapper) with passionfruit, to Hawaiian island-raised lamb, beef and aquaculture products such as Molokai shrimp. Includes a broad variety of produce – most notably tomatoes, [[Strawberry|strawberries]], mushrooms, sweet maui onions and tropical fruits such as papayas, mangoes, lilikoi (passionfruit) and lychee.

===Midwest===
{{Main|Cuisine of the Midwestern United States}}
Midwestern cuisine covers everything from [[barbecue]] to the [[Chicago-style hot dog]].

===The American South===
{{Main|Cuisine of the Southern United States}}
[[File:Fried-Chicken-Leg.jpg|thumb|[[Fried chicken]]]]

The cuisine of the American South has been influenced by the many diverse inhabitants of the region, including Americans of European descent, Native Americans and African Americans. The cuisine of the American South, along with the rest of its culture, is one of the most distinct in all of the country.

===Cuisine in the West===
{{Main|Cuisine of the Western United States}}
Cooking in the American West gets its influence from Native American and Mexican cultures, and other European settlers into the part of the country. Common dishes vary depending on the area. For instance, the Northwest relies on local seafood, while in the Southwest, Mexican flavors are extremely common.

===Common dishes found on a regional level===

==Ethnic and immigrant influence==
{{Original research|section|date=February 2008}}
[[File:Fried Fish and French Fries.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fried fish]] and [[french fries]] in [[San Diego]], California]]

The demand for ethnic foods in the United States reflects the nation's changing diversity as well as its development over time. According to the [[National Restaurant Association]], <blockquote>
Restaurant industry sales are expected to reach a record high of $476 billion in 2005, an increase of 4.9 percent over 2004... Driven by consumer demand, the ethnic food market reached record sales in 2002, and has emerged as the fastest growing category in the food and beverage product sector, according to USBX Advisory Services. Minorities in the U.S. spend a combined $142 billion on food and by 2010, America's ethnic population is expected to grow by 40 percent.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Oralia|2005}} (par. 6).</ref>
</blockquote>

A movement began during the 1980s among popular leading chefs to reclaim America's ethnic foods within its regional traditions, where these trends originated. One of the earliest was [[Paul Prudhomme]], who in 1984 began the introduction of his influential cookbook, ''Paul Prodhomme's Louisiana Kitchen'', by describing the over 200 year history of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and Cajun cooking; he aims to "preserve and expand the Louisiana tradition."<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Prodhomme|1984}} n.p.</ref> Prodhomme's success quickly inspired other chefs. Norman Van Aken embraced a Floridian type cuisine fused with many ethnic and globalized elements in his ''Feast of Sunlight'' cookbook in 1988. The movement finally gained fame around the world when California became swept up in the movement, then seemingly started to lead the trend itself, in, for example, the popular restaurant [[Chez Panisse]] in Berkeley. Examples of the Chez Panisse phenomenon, chefs who embraced a new globalized cuisine, were celebrity chefs like Jeremiah Tower and [[Wolfgang Puck]], both former colleagues at the restaurant. Puck went on to describe his belief in contemporary, new style American cuisine in the introduction to ''The Wolfgang Puck Cookbook'':
<blockquote>
Another major breakthrough, whose originators were once thought to be crazy, is the mixing of ethnic cuisines. It is not at all uncommon to find raw fish listed next to tortillas on the same menu. Ethnic crossovers also occur when distinct elements meet in a single recipe. This country is, after all, a huge melting pot. Why should its cooking not illustrate the American transformation of diversity into unity?<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Puck|1986}} n.p.</ref>
</blockquote>

Puck's former colleague, Jeremiah Tower became synonymous with [[California Cuisine]] and the overall American [[culinary revolution]]. Meanwhile, the restaurant that inspired both Puck and Tower became a distinguished establishment, popularizing its so called "mantra" in its book by [[Paul Bertolli]] and owner [[Alice Waters]], ''Chez Panisse Cooking'', in 1988. Published well after the restaurants' founding in 1971, this new cookbook from the restaurant seemed to perfect the idea and philosophy that had developed over the years. The book embraced America's natural bounty, specifically that of California, while containing recipes that reflected Bertoli and Waters' appreciation of both northern Italian and French style foods.

===Early ethnic influences===
[[File:CornmealProducts.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Adaptation of [[Mexican food]] tailored for the mainstream American market usually is very different than [[Mexican food]] typically served in Mexico itself.]]

While the earliest cuisine of the United States was influenced by indigenous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], the [[Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies|cuisine of the thirteen colonies]] or the culture of the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] [[American South]]; the overall culture of the nation, its [[gastronomy]] and the growing [[culinary arts]] became ever more influenced by its changing [[ethnic]] mix and [[immigrant]] patterns from the 18th and 19th centuries unto the present. Some of the ethnic groups that continued to influence the cuisine were here in prior years; while others arrived more numerously during “The Great [[Transatlantic Migration]] (of 1870—1914) or other [[mass migration]]s.

Some of the ethnic influences could be found in the nation from after the [[American Civil War]] and into the [[History of United States continental expansion]] during most of the 19th century. Ethnic influences already in the nation at that time would include the following groups and their respective cuisines:
*Select nationalities of Europe and the respective developments from [[early modern European cuisine]] of the colonial age:
**[[British-American]]s and on-going developments in [[New England cuisine]], the national traditions founded in cuisine of the thirteen colonies and some aspects of other regional cuisine.
**[[Spanish American]]s and early modern [[Spanish cuisine]], as well as [[Basque-American]]s and [[Basque cuisine]].
**Early [[German-American]] or [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] and [[Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine]]
**[[French American]]s and their "[[New World]]" regional identities such as:
***[[Acadian]]
***[[Cajun]] and [[Cajun cuisine]]
**[[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine]]. Louisiana Creole (also called French Créole) refers to native born people of the New Orleans area who are descended from the Colonial French and/or Spanish settlers of Colonial French Louisiana, before it became part of the United States in 1803 with the [[Louisiana Purchase]].
*The various ethnicities originating from early social factors of [[Race in the United States]] and the [[gastronomy]] and [[cuisine]]s of the “[[New World]],” [[Latin American cuisine]] and North American cuisine:
**[[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] [[Native Americans in the United States]] and [[Native American cuisine|American Indian cuisine]]
**[[African-American]]s and “[[Soul food]].”
** [[Cuisine of Puerto Rico]]
**[[Mexican-American]]s and Mexican-American cuisine; as well as related regional cuisines:
***[[Tex-Mex]] (regional Texas and Mexican fusion)
***Cal-Mex (regional California and Mexican fusion)
***Some aspects of “[[Southwestern cuisine]].”
**[[New Mexican cuisine|Cuisine of New Mexico]]

===Later ethnic and immigrant influence===
{{Main|Immigration to the United States}}

Mass migrations of immigrants to the United States came in several waves. Historians identify several waves of migration to the United States: one from 1815–1860, in which some five million [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Scandinavia]]n, and others from [[northwestern Europe]] came to the United States; one from 1865–1890, in which some 10 million immigrants, also mainly from northwestern Europe, settled, and a third from 1890–1914, in which 15 million immigrants, mainly from [[Central Europe|central]], [[Eastern Europe|eastern]], and [[southern Europe]] (many [[Austrian people|Austrian]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Jewish people|Jewish]], [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Italian people|Italian]], and [[Romanian people|Romanian]]) settled in the United States.<ref>[http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/lectures/lecture08.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>

Together with earlier arrivals to the United States (including the indigenous Native Americans, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]], particularly in the [[Western United States|West]], [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and [[Texas]]; [[African American]]s who came to the United States in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]; and early colonial migrants from Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and elsewhere), these new waves of immigrants had a profound impact on national or regional cuisine. Some of these more prominent groups include the following:

*[[Salvadoran American]]s – [[Salvadoran cuisine]] 
*[[Irish American]]s – [[Irish cuisine]]
*[[Italian American]]s – [[Italian-American cuisine]], [[Italian cuisine]]
*[[German American]]s – [[German cuisine]] (the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], although descended from Germans, arrived earlier than the bulk of German migrants and have distinct culinary traditions)
*[[Scottish American]]s – [[Scottish cuisine]]
*[[Greek American]]s – [[Greek American cuisine]], [[Greek cuisine]], [[Mediterranean cuisine]]
*[[Portuguese American]]s – [[Portuguese cuisine]]
*[[Romanian American]]s – [[Romanian cuisine]]
*[[Polish American]]s – [[Polish cuisine]], with particular impact on [[Cuisine of the Midwestern United States|Midwest]]
*[[Russian American]]s – [[Russian cuisine]], with particular impact on [[Cuisine of the Midwestern United States|Midwest]]
*[[Lithuanian American]]s – [[Lithuanian cuisine]], with particular impact on [[Cuisine of the Midwestern United States|Midwest]]
*[[American Jews]] – [[Jewish cuisine]]
*[[Indian American]]s – [[Indian cuisine]]
*[[Pakistani American]]s – [[Pakistani cuisine]]
*[[Japanese American]]s – [[Japanese cuisine]], with influences on the [[Hawaiian cuisine]]
*[[Polynesian American]]s – [[Hawaiian cuisine]]
*[[West Indian American]]s – [[Caribbean cuisine]], [[Jamaican cuisine]]
*[[Cuban American]]s – [[Cuban cuisine]]
*[[Chinese American]]s – [[American Chinese cuisine]], [[Chinese cuisine]]
*[[Vietnamese American]]s – [[Vietnamese cuisine]]
*[[Arab American]]s, particularly [[Lebanese American]]s (the largest ethnic Arab group in the United States) – [[Arab cuisine]], [[Lebanese cuisine]]

<blockquote>
"Italian, Mexican and Chinese (Cantonese) cuisines have indeed joined the mainstream. These three cuisines have become so ingrained in the American culture that they are no longer foreign to the American palate. According to the study, more than nine out of 10 consumers are familiar with and have tried these foods, and about half report eating them frequently. The research also indicates that Italian, Mexican and Chinese (Cantonese) have become so adapted to such an extent that "authenticity" is no longer a concern to customers."<ref>Hensley, Sue, ''National Restaurant Association.''  Article/ News Release, "International Cuisine Reaches America's Main Street," 10 August 2000.</ref>

Contributions from these ethnic foods have become as common as traditional "American" fares such as hot dogs, hamburgers, beef [[steak]], which are derived from [[German cuisine]], ([[chicken-fried steak]], for example, is a variation on German [[schnitzel]]), cherry pie, [[Coca-Cola]], [[milkshake]]s, fried chicken (Fried chicken is of [[Scottish cuisine|Scottish]] and [[African]] influence) and so on. Nowadays, Americans also have a ubiquitous consumption of foods like [[pizza]] and [[pasta]], [[taco]]s and [[burrito]]s to "[[General Tso's chicken]]" and [[fortune cookie]]s. Fascination with these and other ethnic foods may also vary with region.

==Notable American chefs==
American [[chef]]s have been influential both in the food industry and in popular culture. An important 19th Century American chef was [[Charles Ranhofer]] of [[Delmonico's Restaurant]] in [[New York City]]. American cooking has been exported around the world, both through the global expansion of restaurant chains such as [[T.G.I. Friday's]] and [[McDonald's]] and the efforts of individual restaurateurs such as Bob Payton, credited with bringing American-style pizza to the UK.<ref>Bob Payton, 50, Restaurateur, Dies. New York Times July 16, 1994, Obituary, p 28.[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10611FF355B0C758DDDAE0894DC494D81]</ref>

The first generation of television chefs such as [[Robert Carrier (chef)|Robert Carrier]] and [[Julia Child]] tended to concentrate on cooking based primarily on European, especially French and Italian, cuisines. Only during the 1970s and 1980s did television chefs such as [[James Beard]] and [[Jeff Smith (TV personality)|Jeff Smith]] shift the focus towards home-grown cooking styles, particularly those of the different ethnic groups within the nation. Notable American restaurant chefs include [[Thomas Keller]], [[Charlie Trotter]], [[Grant Achatz]], [[Alfred Portale]], [[Paul Prudhomme]], [[Paul Bertolli]], [[Frank Stitt]], [[Alice Waters]], [[Patrick O'Connell (chef)|Patrick O’Connell]] and [[celebrity chef]]s like [[Mario Batali]], [[Alton Brown]], [[Emeril Lagasse]], [[Cat Cora]], [[Michael Symon]], [[Bobby Flay]], [[Ina Garten]], [[Todd English]], [[Sandra Lee (cook)|Sandra Lee]], [[Anthony Bourdain]], and [[Paula Deen]].

Regional chefs are emerging as localized celebrity chefs with growing broader appeal, such as [[Peter Merriman]] (Hawaii Regional Cuisine), [[Jerry Traunfeld]], [[Alan Wong]] (Pacific Rim cuisine), Norman Van Aken (New World Cuisine – fusion Latin, Caribbean, Asian, African and American), and Mark Miller (American Southwest cuisine).
