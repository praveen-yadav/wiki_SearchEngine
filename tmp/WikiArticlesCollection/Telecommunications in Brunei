===Broadband access===
[[Brunei]]'s internet service is monopolized by a recently incorporated company TelBru under their "[http://www.brunet.bn/ Brunet]" department. ADSL speeds range from 512 kbit/s to the maximum speed of 1 Mbit/s through [[ADSL]] broadband. 1 Mbit/s was only recently introduced in 2006 and priced at BND$128 per month (Equivalent to Singapore currency). It is known that the Brunei's broadband ranging from 512 kbit/s to 1 Mbit/s is one the most expensive in the world. The limited market in Brunei means that development in the telecommunications sector is stagnant. Currently only about 11000 users out of a population of 380,000 have any connection to the Internet. More and more{{quantify|date=October 2010}} users are subscribing to 3G Mobile services. Broadband coverage has spanned the whole of Brunei since the release of "E-Speed 2".

Currently as of 2012, TelBru is deploying its high speed FTTH network capable of 100Mbit/s through a contract awarded to HuaWei. It aims to provide FTTH coverage to around 87% of the population by 2017.

Deployment of 4G LTE Internet is scheduled for the year 2013.[http://www.bt.com.bn/business-national/2012/12/31/fibre-home-4g-part-initiative]
