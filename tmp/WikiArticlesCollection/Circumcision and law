There exist laws restricting or regulating [[circumcision]], some dating back to ancient times.  In a number of modern states, circumcision is presumed to be legal, but under certain circumstances, more general laws, such as laws about assault or child custody, may sometimes be interpreted as applying to situations involving circumcision.  Some countries have placed restrictions on circumcision.

==History==
{{See also|Brit milah}}
There are ancient religious requirements for [[circumcision]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] commands [[Jew]]s to circumcise their male children on the eighth day of life, and to circumcise their male slaves ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:11-12|HE}}).

Laws banning circumcision are also ancient. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] prized the foreskin and disapproved of the Jewish custom of circumcision.<ref name=Hodges2001>{{cite journal |last=Hodges |first=Frederick M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |month= |title=The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme |journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume=75 |issue= 3|pages=375&ndash;405 |id= |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/ |accessdate=22 January 2008 |quote=|doi=10.1353/bhm.2001.0119 |pmid=11568485}}</ref>  [[1 Maccabees]], 1:60–61 states that [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|King Antiochus IV]] of [[Syria]], the occupying power of [[Judea]] in 170 BCE, outlawed circumcision on penalty of death.<ref>[[1 Maccabees]], 1:60–61</ref> one of the grievances leading to the [[Maccabean Revolt]].<ref name = "Miller">{{cite journal

| quote       = Ritual circumcision of boys is a durable tradition. Jews of ancient times refused to abandon the practice despite enormous pressure to do so. In 167 BCE the Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV, as part of a campaign to Hellenise the Jews, condemned to death every Hebrew who allowed a son to be circumcised. The Jews responded with the Maccabean revolt, a campaign of guerrilla warfare that resulted in major victories for the rebels and, eventually, a peace treaty that restored Jewish ritual prerogatives.

According to the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', the [[Roman empire|Roman]] emperor [[Hadrian]] issued a decree banning circumcision in the empire,<ref>[http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/ The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and some modern scholars argue that this was a main cause of the Jewish [[Bar Kokhba's revolt|Bar Kokhba]] revolt of 132 CE.<ref>See, e.g., Alfredo M. Rabello, The Ban on Circumcision as a Cause of Bar Kokhba’s Rebellion, 29 ISRAEL L. REV. 176 (1995) (Arguing that the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Roman rule was primarily motivated by the superimposition of foreign religious standards, rather than by some important notion of independence or sovereignty).</ref> The Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]], however, made no mention of such a law, and blamed the Jewish uprising instead on Hadrian's decision to rebuild [[Jerusalem]] as [[Aelia Capitolina]], a city dedicated to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]].

[[Antoninus Pius]] permitted Jews to circumcise their own sons. However, he forbade the circumcision of non-Jews that were either foreign-slaves or non-Jewish members of the household, contrary to {{bibleverse||Genesis|17:12|HE}} He also made it illegal for a man to convert to Judaism.<ref>[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2004/2004-03-29.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2004.03.29<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Antoninus Pius exempted the [[Egypt]]ian priesthood from the otherwise universal ban on circumcision.

==Modern Law==
===Australia===
In 1993, a non-binding research paper of the [[Queensland Law Reform Commission]] (''Circumcision of Male Infants'') concluded that "On a strict interpretation of the assault provisions of the [[Queensland]] Criminal Code, routine circumcision of a male infant could be regarded as a criminal act", and that doctors who perform circumcision on male infants may be liable to civil claims by that child at a later date.<ref>[http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/QLRC/ QLRC: Circumcision of Male Infants<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  No prosecutions have occurred in Queensland, and circumcisions continue to be performed.

In a case of [[sexual assault]] in [[Queensland, Australia]] (1997), a district court awarded a man damages for nervous shock after a botched attempt to circumcise him with a broken beer bottle in a drunken attack. Making Australian legal history, the award was made against the assailant for unlawful wounding.<ref>[http://www.dispatch.co.za/1997/10/09/page%2015.htm "Man sues for circumcision", (9 October 1997) ''Daily Dispatch'']{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>

In 1999, a [[Perth]] man won A$360,000 in damages after a doctor admitted he botched a circumcision operation at birth which left the man with a badly deformed penis.<ref>[http://www.cirp.org/news/perth1/ Man Receives $360,000 Compensation for Childhood Circumcision<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2002, Queensland police charged a father with grievous bodily harm for having his two sons, then aged nine and five, circumcised without the knowledge and against the wishes of the mother. The mother and father were in a family court dispute. The charges were dropped when the police prosecutor revealed that he did not have all family court paperwork in court and the magistrate refused to grant an adjournment.<ref>[http://www.cirp.org/news/thesundaymail08-11-02/ Mother's Fury as Boys Circumcised]</ref>

Cosmetic circumcision for newborn males is currently banned in all Australian public hospitals, South Australia being the last state to adopt the ban in 2007; the procedure was not forbidden from being performed in private hospitals.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pengelley|first=J|title=SA to ban most circumcisions in state hospitals|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/sa-to-ban-most-circumcisions-in-state-hospitals/story-e6frfkvr-1111114853797|accessdate=7 April 2012|newspaper=The Advertiser|date=12 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22744548-5006787,00.html|title=Public hospitals ban circumcision |date=12 November 2007 |publisher=The Australian |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}.</ref> In the same year, the Tasmanian President of the [[Australian Medical Association]], Haydn Walters, stated that they would support a call to ban circumcision for non-medical, non-religious reasons.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/12/09/2113665.htm |title=Doctors back call for circumcision ban |date=9 December 2007 |publisher=ABC News}}</ref> In 2009, the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute released its Issues Paper investigating the law relating to male circumcision in Tasmania, it "highlights the uncertainty in relation to whether doctors can legally perform circumcision on infant males".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.utas.edu.au/reform/malecircumcision.htm |title=Male circumcision |publisher=Tasmanian Law Reform Institute}}</ref>

===Bulgaria===
Male circumcision was very strongly discouraged in Bulgaria in the 1980s as part of attempts to pressure the country's Muslim minority but there was no actual legislation against the practice.<ref>'Under the Fez and the Foreskin', p113, ''The Orient Within'' (Cornell University Press, 2004) http://theorientwithin.com/</ref>

===Canada===
According to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia:

::"To date, the legality of infant male circumcision has not been tested in the Courts. It is thus assumed to be legal if it is performed competently, in the child’s best interest, and after valid consent has been obtained."

::"At all times the physician must perform the procedure with competence and at all times, the parent and physician must act in the best interests of the child. Signed parental consent for any treatment is assumed to be valid if the parent understands the nature of the procedure and its associated risks and benefits. However, proxy consent by parents is now being questioned. Many believe it should be limited to consent for diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, and that it is not relevant for non-therapeutic procedures."<ref name="cpsbc">[https://www.cpsbc.ca/files/u6/Circumcision-Infant-Male.pdf Circumcision (Infant Male)] In: ''Professional Standards and Guidelines''.

===England and Wales===
Male circumcision has traditionally been presumed to be legal under British law,<ref>{{cite book |title=English Criminal Law and Ethnic Minority Customs |last=Poulter |first=Sebastian |publisher=Butterworths,London |isbn=0-406-18000-8<!-- ISBN shown in the cited webpage is erroneous and invalid. --> |year=1986 |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/poulter/|quote=<small> , no amount of parental agreement or support can legitimise the circumcision, excision or infibulation of a young girl in this country, unless the operation is for therapeutic purposes.<small>}}</ref> however some authors have argued that there is no solid foundation for this view in English law.<ref name="cirp">[http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/UKlaw/fox-thomson2005/ A covenant with the status quo?

The passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] has led to some speculation that the lawfulness of the circumcision of male children is unclear.<ref>[http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/edge1/ Circumcision After the Human Rights Act 1998<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

One 1999 case, ''Re "J" (child's religious upbringing and circumcision)''<ref>[http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/Re_J/ Re J (child's religious upbringing and circumcision)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> said that circumcision in Britain required the consent of all those with parental responsibility, or the permission of the court, acting for the best interests of the child, and issued an order prohibiting the circumcision of a male child of a non-practicing [[Muslim]] father and non-practicing [[Christian]] mother with custody. The reasoning included evidence that circumcision carried some medical risk; that the operation would be likely to weaken the relationship of the child with his mother, who strongly objected to circumcision without [[medical necessity]]; that the child may be subject to ridicule by his peers as the odd one out and that the operation might irreversibly reduce sexual pleasure, by permanently removing some sensory nerves, even though cosmetic foreskin restoration might be possible. The court did not rule out circumcision against the consent of one parent. It cited a hypothetical case of a Jewish mother and an agnostic father with a number of sons, all of whom, by agreement, had been circumcised as infants in accordance with Jewish laws; the parents then have another son who is born after they have separated; the mother wishes him to be circumcised like his brothers; the father refuses his agreement. In such a case, a decision in favor of circumcision was said to be likely.

In 2001 the General Medical Council had found a doctor who had botched circumcision operations guilty of abusing his professional position and that he had acted "inappropriately and irresponsibly",<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1502729.stm | work=BBC News | title=Circumcision doctors 'abused position' | date=21 August 2001 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> and struck him off the register.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2003/3/3/101692.html Circumcision case GP told he can resume career<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  A doctor who had referred patients to him, and who had pressured a mother into agreeing to the surgery, was also condemned.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> He was put on an 18 month period of review and retraining, and was allowed to resume unrestricted practice as a doctor in March 2003, after a committee found that he had complied with conditions it placed on him. According to the ''Northern Echo'', he "told the committee he has now changed his approach to circumcision referrals, accepting that most cases can be treated without the need for surgery.".<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Fox and Thomson (2005) argue that consent cannot be given for non-therapeutic circumcision.<ref name="cirp" /> They say there is "no compelling legal authority for the common view that circumcision is lawful."

In 2005 a Muslim man had his son circumcised against the wishes of the child's mother who was the custodial parent. He was found not guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm by a majority verdict of the jury.<ref>[http://icsurreyonline.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0400crawley/tm_objectid=15505735&method=full&siteid=50101&headline=father-cleared-of-assault-name_page.html icNetwork - Local and regional news, sport, entertainment and classifieds across the UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050523125330/http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=4497150 | title=Muslim Accused of Assaulting Son Through Circumcision | date=3 May 2005 | accessdate=5 June 2011 | first=James | last=Tapsfield | publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]''}}</ref>

In 2009 it was reported that a 20 year old man whose father had him ritually circumcised as a baby is preparing to sue the doctor who circumcised him. This is believed to be the first time a person who was circumcised as an infant has made a claim in the UK. The case is expected to be heard in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/11/17/snip-op-illegal-115875-21828059/|title=Ritual circumcisions 'illegal'|work=[[Daily Mirror]]}}</ref>

===Europe===
On 1 October 2013, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] adopted a resolution in which they state they are "particularly worried about a category of violation of the physical integrity of children," and include in this category "circumcision of young boys for religious reasons."<ref>Parliamentary Assembly, Council of Europe.

===Finland===
In August 2006, a [[Finland|Finnish]] court ruled that the circumcision of a four-year-old boy arranged by his mother, who is Muslim, to be an illegal assault. The boy's father, who had not been consulted, reported the incident to the police.  A local prosecutor stated that the prohibition of circumcision is not gender-specific in Finnish law.  A lawyer for the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health stated that there is neither legislation nor prohibition on male circumcision, and that "the operations have been performed on the basis of common law."  The case was  appealed <ref name="Helsingin Sanomat">{{cite web |title=Court rules circumcision of four-year-old boy illegal |url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Court+rules+circumcision+of+four-year-old+boy+illegal/1135220958830}}</ref> and in October 2008 the Finnish Supreme Court ruled that the circumcision, " carried out for religious and social reasons and in a medical manner, did not have the earmarks of a criminal offence. It pointed out in its ruling that the circumcision of Muslim boys is an established tradition and an integral part of the identity of Muslim men".<ref>http://yle.fi/news/id104896.html</ref> In 2008, the Finnish government was reported to be considering a new law to legalise circumcision if the practitioner is a doctor and if the child consents.<ref>{{cite web

In February 2010, a Jewish couple were fined for causing bodily harm to their then infant son who was circumcised in 2008 by a [[mohel]] brought in from the UK. Normal procedure for persons of Jewish faith in Finland is to have a locally certified mohel who works in Finnish healthcare perform the operation. In the 2008 case, the infant was not anesthetized and developed complications that required immediate hospital care. The parents were ordered to pay 1500 euros in damages to their child.<ref>{{cite web

The [[Roman Catholic]] [[archbishop]] of [[Aachen]], [[Heinrich Mussinghoff]], said that the ruling was "very surprising", and the contradiction between "basic rights on freedom of religion and the well-being of the child brought up by the judges is not convincing in this very case."

In July, in Berlin, a criminal complaint was lodged against Rabbi Yitshak Ehrenberg for "causing bodily harm" by performing religious circumcision, and for vocal support of the continuation of the practice. In September, the prosecutors dismissed the complaint, concluding that "there is no proof to establish that the rabbi’s conduct met the 'condition of a criminal' violation."<ref name=JPost_Ehrenberg>{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=283252 | title=Berlin prosecutor nixes circumcision complaint | publisher=Jerusalem Post | date=30 August 2012 | accessdate=6 September 2012 | author=WEINTHAL, BENJAMIN}}</ref>

On 12 December 2012, following a series of hearings and consultations, the Bundestag adopted the proposed law explicitly permitting non-therapeutic circumcision to be performed under certain conditions; it is now §1631(d) in the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]]. The vote tally was 434 ayes, 100 noes, and 46 abstentions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beschneidung von Jungen jetzt gesetzlich geregelt |url=http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2012/42042381_kw50_de_beschneidung/index.html |language=German}}</ref> Following approval by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] and signing by the [[President of Germany|Bundespräsident]], the new law became effective on 28 December 2012 a day after its publication in the [[Bundesgesetzblatt|Federal Gazette]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gesetz über den Umfang der Personensorge bei einer Beschneidung des männlichen Kindes |url=http://www.bgbl.de/Xaver/media.xav?SID=anonymous3567343041308&bk=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl&name=bgbl%2FBundesgesetzblatt%20Teil%20I%2F2012%2FNr.%2061%20vom%2027.12.2012%2Fbgbl112s2749.pdf |language=German}}</ref>

===Ireland===
In October 2005 a [[Nigeria]]n man was cleared of a charge of reckless endangerment over the death of a baby from haemorrhage and shock after he had circumcised the child. The judge directed the jury not to "bring what he called their white western values to bear when they were deciding this case" and after deliberating for an hour and a half they found the defendant not guilty.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1007/igbinediono.html | work=RTÉ News | title=Nigerian cleared over circumcision death | date=7 October 2005}}</ref>

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], Jewish circumcision is entirely legal, as is posthumous circumcision.

In September 2013, the [[Children's Ombudsman|Children's ombudsmen]] in all the Nordic countries issued a common statement where they called for a ban on circumcision on minors, stating that such circumsions violate the right of children after the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] to co-determination and protection from harmful traditions.<ref>Lise Marit Kalstad (2 October 2013): [http://www.vl.no/samfunn/vil-la-gutter-bestemme-omskjaring-selv/ Vil la gutter bestemme omskjæring selv] ''[[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]]''. {{no icon}}</ref>

===South Africa===
The [[Children's Act 2005]] makes the circumcision of male children under 16 unlawful except for religious or medical reasons. In the [[Eastern Cape]] province the Application of Health Standards in Traditional Circumcision Act, 2001, regulates traditional circumcision, which causes the death or mutilation of many youths by traditional surgeons each year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=73278|title=SOUTH AFRICA: Clamping down on botched circumcisions|date=1 August 2007|work=IRIN In-Depth|location=MTHATA}}</ref> Among other provisions, the minimum age for circumcision is age 18.

In 2004, a 22 year old Rastafarian convert was forcibly circumcised by a group of [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] tribal elders and relatives. When he first fled, two police returned him to those who had circumcised him.<ref>{{cite web

===Sweden===
In 2001, the [[Parliament of Sweden]] enacted a law allowing only persons certified by the National Board of Health to circumcise infants. It requires a medical doctor or an anesthesia nurse to accompany the circumciser and for anaesthetic to be applied beforehand. After the first two months of life circumcisions can only be performed by a [[physician]]. The stated purpose of the law was to increase the safety of the procedure.<ref name="SR">{{cite news |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1316&artikel=974694 |newspaper=[[Sveriges Radio]] |date=22 October 2006 |title=Snitt som kostar - om omskärelse av pojkar |language=Swedish}}</ref>

===United States===
Circumcision of adults who grant personal informed consent for the surgical operation is not at issue and is unquestionably lawful.

In the United States, non-therapeutic circumcision of male children has long been assumed to be lawful in every jurisdiction provided that one parent grants surrogate informed consent, however Adler (2013) has recently challenged the validity of this assumption.<ref>Peter W. Adler. [http://rjolpi.richmond.edu/archive/Adler_Formatted.pdf Is Circumcision Legal?] 16(3) Richmond J. L. & Pub.

'''Disputes between parents'''

Occasionally the courts are asked to make a ruling when parents cannot agree on whether or not to circumcise a child.

In January  2001 a dispute between divorcing parents in New Jersey was resolved when the mother, who sought to have the boy circumcised withdrew her request. The boy had experienced two instances of foreskin inflammation and she wanted to have him circumcised. The father, who had experienced a traumatic circumcision as a child objected and they turned to the courts for a decision. The Medical Society of New Jersey and the Urological Society of New Jersey both opposed any court ordered medical treatment. As the parties came to an agreement, no precedent was set.<ref>[http://www.cirp.org/news/star-ledger01-25-01/ Accord Not To Circumcise Son Still Leaves Heated Legal Debate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In June 2001 a Nevada court settled a dispute over circumcision between two parents but put a strict gag order on the terms of the settlement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/cgi-bin/printable.cgi?/lvrj_home/2001/Jun-25-Mon-2001/news/16387263.html|title=Gag order issued|last=Thevemot|first=Carri Geer|date=25 June 2001|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]}}</ref> In July 2001 a dispute between parents in [[Kansas]] over circumcision was resolved when the mother's request to have the infant circumcised was withdrawn.

On 24 July 2001 the parents reached agreement that the infant would not be circumcised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cirp.org/news/wichitaeagle07-24-01 |title=Agreement reached in circumcision case |date=25 July 2001 |publisher=The Wichita Eagle |accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cirp.org/news/wichitaeagle07-13-01/ |title=Wichitans fight over their son's circumcision |author=Alex Branch |date=13 July 2001 |publisher=The Wichita Eagle}}</ref>

In November 2007, the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] heard arguments from a divorced [[Oregon]] couple over the circumcision of their son. The father wanted his son, who turned 13 on 2 March 2008, to be circumcised in accordance with the father's religious views; the child's mother opposes the procedure.  The parents dispute whether the boy is in favor of the procedure. A group opposed to circumcision filed briefs in support of the mother's position, while some Jewish groups filed a brief in support of the father.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gerstein |first=Josh |title=Ore.

'''Other disputes'''

In September 2004 the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] rejected a mother's attempt to prosecute her doctor for circumcising her child without fully informing her of the consequences of the procedure. The judge and jury found that the defendants were adequately informed of possible complications, and the jury further found that it is not incumbent on the doctors to describe every "insignificant" risk.<ref name = "FargoForum2004">{{cite news

The justices rejected Flatt's argument that she received inadequate information before consenting to her son's circumcision shortly after his birth in 1997. If she had had more information, she would not have consented, she said.…Jurors agreed with defense attorneys' arguments that Flatt had been told of the possible complications and that there is no need for doctors to outline every possible "insignificant" risk.

===USSR===
Before [[glasnost]], according to an article in [[The Jewish Press]], Jewish ritual circumcision was forbidden in the [[USSR]].<ref>Barbara Oka, [http://www.russianjewry.org/about/media/jp9.php "Soviet Jews Of All Ages Seek Circumcision"], ''The Jewish Press'', 14 March 1991.</ref> However, David E. Fishman, professor of Jewish History at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], states that, whereas the ''[[Cheder|heder]]'' and ''[[yeshiva]]'', the organs of Jewish education, "were banned by virtue of the law separating church and school, and subjected to tough police and administrative actions," circumcision was not proscribed by law or suppressed by executive measures.<ref>David E. Fishman, "Judaism in the USSR, 1917-1930: The Fate of Religious Education," in: Yaacov Ro'i, ed., ''Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union'' (Cummings Center Series; London: Cass, 1995), 251-262; pp. 251-252.</ref>
Jehoshua A. Gilboa writes that while circumcision was not officially or explicitly banned, pressure was exerted to make it difficult. ''[[Mohel]]s'' in particular were concerned that they could be punished for any health issue that might develop, even if it arose some time after the circumcision.<ref>"There was no official prohibition of circumcision and, on the whole, even the propaganda attacks on it were relatively restrained, apparently out of consideration for the presence of many millions of Moslems [...] in the Soviet Union. But at the same time numerous pressures were exerted to make observance of this precept [i.e., circumcision] difficult. Needless to say, Jewish members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] were in an embarrassing situation when they personally faced the question whether to circumcise their sons [...] And the uncertainty weighed heaviest on the ''mohalim'' themselves [...] Any health problem developing in the baby some time after circumcision could serve to incriminate the ''mohel''. It is easy to imagine, for example, the impact of news items on the death of children because of [...] circumcision (and the punishments imposed on ''mohalim''), even if there were no explicit legal bans on circumcision." Jehoshua A. Gilboa, ''A Language Silenced: The Suppression of Hebrew Literature and Culture in the Soviet Union'' (London: Associated University Press, 1982), pp. 34-35.</ref>
