'''Apollinarism''' or '''Apollinarianism''' was a view proposed by [[Apollinaris of Laodicea]] (died 390) that [[Jesus]] could not have had a human mind; rather, that Jesus had a [[human]] body and lower soul (the seat of the emotions) but a [[God|divine]] mind. 

The [[Trinity]] had been recognized at the Council of Nicea in 325, but debate about exactly what it meant continued. A rival to the more common belief that Jesus Christ had two natures was [[monophysitism]] ("one nature"), the doctrine that Christ had only one nature. Apollinarism and [[Eutychianism]] were two forms of monophysitism. Apollinaris' rejection that Christ had a human mind was considered an over-reaction to [[Arianism]] and its teaching that Christ was not divine.<ref>McGrath, Alistair. 1998.

[[Theodoret]] charged Apollinaris with confounding the persons of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], and with giving in to the heretical ways of [[Sabellius]]. [[Basil of Caesarea]] accused him of abandoning the literal sense of the scripture, and taking up wholly with the allegorical sense. His views were condemned in a [[Synod]] at [[Alexandria]], under [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], in 362, and later subdivided into several different heresies, the main ones of which were the [[Polemian]]s and the [[Antidicomarianite]]s.

It was declared to be a [[Christian heresy|heresy]] in 381 by the [[First Council of Constantinople]], since Christ was officially depicted as fully human and fully God. Followers of Apollinarianism were accused of attempting to create a [[tertium quid]] ("third thing," neither God nor man).

Apollinaris further taught, following [[Tertullian]], that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of men were propagated by other souls, as well as their bodies (see [[traducianism]]). {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
