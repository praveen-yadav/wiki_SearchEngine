==Etymology==
The word was coined from the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ἀνδρ- 'man' and the suffix ''[[Wiktionary:-oid|-oid]]'' 'having the form or likeness of'.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision, December 2008</ref>

The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' traces the earliest use (as "Androides") to [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]],'' in reference to an [[automaton]] that St. [[Albertus Magnus]] allegedly created.<ref name="Stableford2006"/><ref>''OED'' at "android" citing Ephraim Chambers, ''Cyclopædia; or, a universal dictionary of arts and sciences.'' 1728.</ref> The term "android" appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=QhIAAAAAEBAJ&dq=patent:40891%7C|title=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Patent# 40891, ''Toy Automation''|publisher=[[Google Patents]]| accessdate = 2007-01-07}}</ref> The term ''android'' was used in a more modern sense by the French author [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]] in his work ''[[The Future Eve|Tomorrow's Eve]]'' (1886).<ref name="Stableford2006"/> This story features an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly. As said by the officer in the story, "In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls." The term made an impact into English [[pulp science fiction]] starting from [[Jack Williamson]]'s ''[[The Cometeers]]'' (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s [[Captain Future]] (1940–1944).<ref name="Stableford2006"/>

Although [[Karel Čapek|Karel Čapek's]] robots in ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' (1921)&nbsp;– the play that introduced the word ''[[robot]]'' to the world&nbsp;– were organic artificial humans, the word "robot" has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.<ref name="Stableford2006"/> The term "android" can mean either one of these,<ref name="Stableford2006"/> while a [[cyborg]] ("cybernetic organism" or "bionic man") would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.

The term "[[Droid (robot)|droid]]", coined by [[George Lucas]] for the original ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' film and now used widely within science fiction, originated as an abridgment of "android", but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot, including distinctly non-human form machines like [[R2-D2]]. The word "android" was used in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode ''What Are Little Girls Made Of?'' The abbreviation "andy", coined as a [[pejorative]] by writer [[Philip K. Dick]] in his novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', has seen some further usage, such as within the TV series ''[[Total Recall 2070]]''.<ref name="TR2070">{{Cite episode|title=Rough Whimper of Insanity|url=http://www.fancast.com/tv/Total-Recall-2070/10604/full-episodes|series=Total Recall 2070|serieslink=Total Recall 2070|credits=Levin, Drew S. (exec. prod.)|network=[[Channel Zero Inc.|Channel Zero]]|station=[[CHCH-TV]]|city=[[Toronto]]|airdate=February 23, 1999|season=1|number=7|minutes=2:10}}</ref>

Authors have used the term ''android'' in more diverse ways than ''[[robot]]'' or ''[[cyborg]]''. In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics.<ref name="Stableford2006"/> In other stories, authors have used the word "android" to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.<ref name="Stableford2006"/> Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.<ref name="Stableford2006"/>

Eric G. Wilson, who defines androids as a "synthetic human being", distinguishes between three types of androids, based on their body's composition:
* the mummy type - where androids are made of "dead things" or "stiff, inanimate, natural material", such as mummies, puppets, dolls and statues
* the golem type - androids made from flexible, possibly organic material, including golems and homunculi
* the automaton type - androids which are a mix of dead and living parts, including automatons and robots<ref name="Wilson2006"/>

Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[Simulacrum|simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[Automata theory|automata]]'' (devices that have independence).

==Projects==

===Japan===
[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|DER 01, a Japanese [[actroid]]]]
The Intelligent Robotics Lab, directed by [[Hiroshi Ishiguro]] at [[Osaka University]], and Kokoro Co., Ltd. have demonstrated the [[Actroid]] at [[Expo 2005]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]], Japan. In 2006, Kokoro Co. developed a new ''DER 2'' android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165&nbsp;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The "air servosystem" which Kokoro Co. developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.

The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the [[Tokyo University of Science]], has developed an android head called ''Saya'', which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in [[Yokohama]], Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is ''working'' at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.

The [[Waseda University]] (Japan) and [[NTT docomo|NTT Docomo's]] manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot ''WD-2''. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To "copy" a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.

===Korea===
[[File:Ever-2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[EveR-2]], the first android that has the ability to [[singing|sing]]]]

[[KITECH]] researched and developed [[EveR-1]], an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial "musculature" and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words. She is {{nowrap|160 cm}} tall and weighs {{nowrap|50 kg}}, matching the average figure of a Korean women in her twenties. EveR-1's name derives from the [[Eve|Biblical Eve]], plus the letter ''r'' for ''robot''. EveR-1's advanced computing processing power enables [[speech recognition]] and vocal synthesis, at the same time processing [[lip synchronization]] and visual recognition by 90-degree micro-[[charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras with [[facial recognition system|face recognition technology]]. An independent microchip inside her artificial brain handles gesture expression, body coordination, and emotion expression. Her whole body is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly silicon and with 60 artificial joints in her face, neck, and lower body; she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing. In South Korea, the [[Ministry of Information and Communication (South Korea)|Ministry of Information and Communication]]  has an ambitious plan to put a robot in every household by 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/09/060906-robots.html |title=A Robot in Every Home by 2020, South Korea Says |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref> Several robot cities have been planned for the country: the first will be built in 2009 at a cost of 500 billion won, of which 50 billion is direct government investment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/27/south-korea-set-to-build-robot-land/ |title=South Korea set to build "Robot Land" |publisher=Engadget |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref> The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers, as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions. The country's new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future, setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers, as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070316-robot-ethics.html |title=Robot Code of Ethics to Prevent Android Abuse, Protect Humans |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref>

[[David Hanson (robotics designer)|Hanson Robotics, Inc.]], of Texas and [[KAIST]] produced an android portrait of [[Albert Einstein]], using Hanson's facial android technology mounted on KAIST's life-size walking bipedal robot body. This Einstein android, also called "[[Albert Hubo]]", thus represents the first full-body walking android in history (see video at <ref>[http://www.hansonrobotics.wordpress.com Einstein Video<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>). Hanson Robotics, the FedEx Institute of Technology,<ref>[http://www.fedex.memphis.edu FedEx Institute of Technology :: FedEx Institute of Technology :: University of Memphis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the University of Texas at Arlington also developed the android portrait of sci-fi author [[Philip K. Dick]] (creator of ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', the basis for the film ''[[Blade Runner]]''), with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the author's works.<ref>[http://www.pkdandroid.org/about.htm About the Philip K Dick Android]</ref> In 2005, the PKD android won a first place [[artificial intelligence]] award from [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]].

===United Kingdom===
In 2001, [[Steve Grand]] OBE, creator of the computer game ''Creatures'', created an android, or anthropoid, he named Lucy. The intention was that she would have to learn everything, including how to use her mechanical [[vocal chord]]s to speak. Her systems were made to be similar to a human's.

<!-- Please add descriptions of individual androids to that list, not here, so as to avoid duplication. Thanks! -->

Androids are a staple of [[science fiction]]. [[Isaac Asimov]] pioneered the fictionalization of the science of [[robotics]] and [[artificial intelligence]], notably in his 1950s series ''[[I, Robot]]'' and ''[[Foundation and Empire]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jonathan Barra|first=Roger Caille et al|title=The Android Generation|url=http://midnighttracks.net/2012/2012_rdr_8.html|publisher=West Coast Midnight Run/Citadel Consulting Group LLC|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> One thing common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots&nbsp;– such as the creation of [[Strong AI|strong artificial intelligence]]&nbsp;– are assumed to have been solved.<ref name="Van Riper 11">Van Riper, op.cit., p. 11.</ref> Fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans&nbsp;– moving, thinking and speaking as fluidly as them.<ref name="Stableford2006"/><ref name="Van Riper 11"/>

The tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance&nbsp;– or even human ambitions&nbsp;– of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions.<ref name="Wilson2006"/><ref name="Van Riper 11"/> Some android heroes seek, like [[Pinocchio]], to become human, as in the films ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'', ''[[Hollywood (Kannada film)|Hollywood]]'', ''[[Enthiran]]'' and ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'',<ref name="Van Riper 11" /> or [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Others, as in the film ''[[Westworld]]'', rebel against abuse by careless humans.<ref name="Van Riper 11"/> Android hunter [[Deckard]] in ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' and its film adaptation ''[[Blade Runner]]'' discovers that his targets are, in some ways, more human than he is.<ref name="Van Riper 11"/> Android stories, therefore, are not essentially stories "about" androids; they are stories about the [[human condition]] and what it means to be human.<ref name="Van Riper 11"/>

One aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring [[racism]] in society, as in ''Blade Runner''.<ref name="Dinello76">{{Cite book|last=Dinello|first=Daniel|title=Technophobia!: Science Fiction Visions of Posthuman Technology|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BA_1sOD40K4C&pg=PA76|accessdate=22 November 2011|year=2005|page=76}}</ref> Perhaps the clearest example of this is [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner's]] 1968 novel ''[[Into the Slave Nebula]]'', where the blue-skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|last= D'Ammassa|first=Don|year=2005|publisher=Facts on File|page = 58|isbn = 978-0-8160-5924-9}}</ref> More recently, the androids [[Bishop (Aliens)|Bishop]] and Annalee Call in the films ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an "[[Other]]".<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1353/cj.2005.0011|last=Nishime|first=LeiLani|title=The Mulatto Cyborg: Imagining a Multiracial Future|journal = Cinema Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=34–49|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|date=Winter 2005|accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref>

Female androids, or "[[gynoid]]s", are often seen in science fiction, and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical "perfect woman".<ref name=melzer202>{{Cite book|title=Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought|last=Melzer|first=Patricia|year=2006|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|page=202|isbn= 978-0-292-71307-9}}</ref> Examples include the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of ''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]'' and [[Maschinenmensch|the female robot Maria]] in [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. Some gynoids, like Pris in [[Blade Runner]], are designed as sex-objects, with the intent of "pleasing men's violent sexual desires,<ref>Melzer, p. 204</ref>" or as submissive, servile companions, such as in ''[[The Stepford Wives]]''. Fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing "essentialist ideas of femininity",<ref>{{Cite book|title = SciFi in the mind's eye: reading science through science fiction|last=Grebowicz|first=Margret|authorlink= |coauthors= L.
