Cellulose is mainly used to produce [[paperboard]] and [[paper]]. Smaller quantities are converted into a wide variety of derivative products such as [[cellophane]] and [[rayon]]. Conversion of cellulose from [[energy crop]]s into [[biofuel]]s such as [[cellulosic ethanol]] is under investigation as an alternative fuel source. Cellulose for industrial use is mainly obtained from [[wood pulp]] and [[cotton]].<ref name="Klemm"/>

Some animals, particularly [[ruminant]]s and [[termite]]s, can [[digestion|digest]] cellulose with the help of [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] micro-organisms that live in their guts, such as [[Trichonympha]]. Humans can digest cellulose to some extent,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Slavin|first1=JL|last2=Brauer|first2=PM|last3=Marlett|first3=JA|title=Neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose and cellulose digestibility in human subjects|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=111|issue=2|pages=287–97|year=1981|pmid=6257867}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01089198|last1=Joshi|first1=S|last2=Agte|first2=V|title=Digestibility of dietary fiber components in vegetarian men|journal=Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)|volume=48|issue=1|pages=39–44|year=1995|pmid=8719737}}</ref> however it mainly acts as a [[hydrophilic]] bulking agent for [[feces]] and is often referred to as "[[dietary fiber]]".

== History ==

Cellulose was discovered in 1838 by the French chemist [[Anselme Payen]], who isolated it from plant matter and determined its chemical formula.<ref name=Crawford /><ref>Payen, A. (1838) "Mémoire sur la composition du tissu propre des plantes et du ligneux" (Memoir on the composition of the tissue of plants and of woody [material]), ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 7, pp. 1052–1056. Payen added appendices to this paper on December 24, 1838 (see: ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 8, p. 169 (1839)) and on February 4, 1839 (see: ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 9, p. 149 (1839)). A committee of the French Academy of Sciences reviewed Payen's findings in : Jean-Baptiste Dumas (1839) "Rapport sur un mémoire de M. Payen, relatif à la composition de la matière ligneuse" (Report on a memoir of Mr. Payen, regarding the composition of woody matter), ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 8, pp. 51–53. In this report, the word "cellulose" is coined and author points out the similarity between the empirical formula of cellulose and that of "dextrine" (starch). The above articles are reprinted in: Brongniart and Guillemin, eds., ''Annales des sciences naturelles'' ..., 2nd series, vol. 11 (Paris, France: Crochard et Cie., 1839), [http://books.google.com/books?id=VDRsFWwgUo4C&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21 pp. 21–31].</ref><ref name="Young">{{cite book

Production to [[rayon]] ("artificial silk") from cellulose began in the 1890s and [[cellophane]] was invented in 1912. [[Hermann Staudinger]] determined the polymer structure of cellulose in 1920. The compound was first chemically synthesized (without the use of any biologically derived [[enzyme]]s) in 1992, by Kobayashi and Shoda.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kobayashi|first=Shiro|coauthors=Kashiwa, Keita; Shimada, Junji; Kawasaki, Tatsuya; Shoda, Shin-ichiro|title=Enzymatic polymerization: The first in vitro synthesis of cellulose via nonbiosynthetic path catalyzed by cellulase|journal=Makromolekulare Chemie.

== Structure and properties ==

Cellulose has no taste, is odorless, is [[hydrophilic]] with the [[contact angle]] of 20–30,<ref>{{cite book|title=Vacuum deposition onto webs, films, and foils|editor=Bishop, Charles A. |year=2007|isbn=0-8155-1535-9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vP9E3z7o6iIC&pg=PA165|page=165}}</ref> is insoluble in [[water]] and most organic [[solvent]]s, is [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and is [[biodegradation|biodegradable]]. It can be broken down chemically into its glucose units by treating it with concentrated acids at high temperature.

Cellulose is derived from [[Glucose|<small>D</small>-glucose]] units, which [[condensation reaction|condense]] through β(1→4)-[[glycosidic bond]]s. This linkage motif contrasts with that for α(1→4)-glycosidic bonds present in [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and other carbohydrates. Cellulose is a straight chain polymer: unlike starch, no coiling or branching occurs, and the molecule adopts an extended and rather stiff rod-like conformation, aided by the equatorial conformation of the glucose residues. The multiple [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl groups]] on the glucose from one chain form [[hydrogen bond]]s with oxygen atoms on the same or on a neighbor chain, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming ''microfibrils'' with high [[tensile strength]]. This confers tensile strength in [[cell wall]]s, where cellulose microfibrils are meshed into a polysaccharide ''matrix''.

[[File:cellulose spacefilling model.jpg|thumb|A triple strand of cellulose showing the hydrogen bonds (cyan lines) between glucose strands]]
Compared to starch, cellulose is also much more [[crystallinity|crystalline]]. Whereas starch undergoes a crystalline to [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] transition when heated beyond 60–70&nbsp;°C in water (as in cooking), cellulose requires a temperature of 320&nbsp;°C and pressure of 25 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]] to become amorphous in water.<ref name=Deguchi>{{cite journal|last1=Deguchi|first1=Shigeru|last2=Tsujii|first2=Kaoru|last3=Horikoshi|first3=Koki|title=Cooking cellulose in hot and compressed water|journal=Chemical Communications|page=3293|year=2006|doi=10.1039/b605812d|issue=31}}</ref>

Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Natural cellulose is cellulose I, with structures I<sub>α</sub> and I<sub>β</sub>. Cellulose produced by bacteria and algae is enriched in I<sub>α</sub> while cellulose of higher plants consists mainly of I<sub>β</sub>. Cellulose in regenerated cellulose fibers is cellulose II. The conversion of cellulose I to cellulose II is irreversible, suggesting that cellulose I is [[Metastability|metastable]] and cellulose II is stable. With various chemical treatments it is possible to produce the structures cellulose III and cellulose IV.<ref>[http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/glyco3d/lessons/cellulose/index.html Structure and morphology of cellulose] by Serge Pérez and William Mackie, CERMAV-[[CNRS]], 2001. Chapter IV.</ref>

Many properties of cellulose depend on its chain length or [[degree of polymerization]], the number of glucose units that make up one polymer molecule. Cellulose from wood pulp has typical chain lengths between 300 and 1700 units; cotton and other plant fibers as well as bacterial cellulose have chain lengths ranging from 800 to 10,000 units.<ref name="Klemm"/>  Molecules with very small chain length resulting from the breakdown of cellulose are known as [[cellodextrin]]s; in contrast to long-chain cellulose, cellodextrins are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

Plant-derived cellulose is usually found in a mixture with [[hemicellulose]], [[lignin]], [[pectin]] and other substances, while [[microbial cellulose]] is quite pure, has a much higher water content. Both consist of long chains.

Cellulose is soluble in [[Schweizer's reagent]], [[cupriethylenediamine]] (CED), [[cadmiumethylenediamine]] (Cadoxen), [[N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide|''N''-methylmorpholine ''N''-oxide]] and [[lithium chloride]] / [[dimethylformamide]].<ref>{{cite book |last1= Stenius |first1= Per |title= Forest Products Chemistry |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume=Vol. 3 |year= 2000 |publisher= Fapet OY |location= Finland |isbn= 952-5216-03-9 |page= 35 |chapter=Ch. 1}}</ref> This is used in the production of regenerated celluloses (such as [[viscose]] and [[cellophane]]) from [[dissolving pulp]].

Cellulose consists of [[crystalline]] and [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] regions. By treating it with strong acid, the amorphous regions can be broken up, thereby producing [[nanocellulose|nanocrystalline cellulose]], a novel material with many desirable properties.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Chemistry and applications of nanocrystalline cellulose and its derivatives: A nanotechnology perspective|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=89|issue=5|pages=1191–1206|url=http://www.arboranano.ca/pdfs/Chemistry%20and%20applications%20of%20nanocrystalline%20cellulose%20and%20its%20derivatives%20A%20nanotechnology%20perspective-2011.pdf|author=Peng, B. L., Dhar, N., Liu, H. L. and Tam, K. C.|doi=10.1002/cjce.20554}}</ref> Recently, [[nanocrystalline cellulose]] was used as the filler phase in bio-based [[polymer]] matrices to produce [[nanocomposite]]s with superior thermal and mechanical properties.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1021/ma8020213}}</ref>

==Processing==
=== Assay ===

Given a cellulose-containing material, the carbohydrate portion that does not dissolve in a 17.5% solution of [[sodium hydroxide]] at 20&nbsp;°C is ''α cellulose'', which is true cellulose{{Clarify|date=May 2013}}. Acidification of the extract precipitates ''β cellulose''. The portion that dissolves in base but does not precipitate with acid is ''γ cellulose''{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

Cellulose can be [[assay]]ed using a method described by Updegraff in 1969, where the fiber is dissolved in [[acetic acid|acetic]] and [[nitric acid]] to remove [[lignin]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[xylosan]]s. The resulting cellulose is allowed to react with [[anthrone]] in [[sulfuric acid]]. The resulting coloured compound is assayed [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometrically]] at a wavelength of approximately 635 [[1 E-9 m|nm]].

In addition, cellulose is represented by the difference between acid detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL).

=== Biosynthesis ===

In [[vascular plant]]s cellulose is synthesized at the [[plasma membrane]] by rosette terminal complexes (RTCs). The RTCs are [[oligomer|hexameric]] protein structures, approximately 25 [[nanometre|nm]] in diameter, that contain the cellulose [[synthase]] enzymes that synthesise the individual cellulose chains.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3871010|last1=Kimura|first1=S|last2=Laosinchai|first2=W|last3=Itoh|first3=T|last4=Cui|first4=X|last5=Linder|first5=CR|last6=Brown Jr|first6=RM|title=Immunogold labeling of rosette terminal cellulose-synthesizing complexes in the vascular plant vigna angularis|journal=The Plant cell|volume=11|issue=11|pages=2075–86|year=1999|pmid=10559435|pmc=144118|jstor=3871010}}</ref> Each RTC floats in the cell's plasma membrane and "spins" a microfibril into the [[cell wall]].

RTCs contain at least three different cellulose synthases, encoded by ''CesA'' genes, in an unknown [[stoichiometry]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=N. G.|title=Interactions among three distinct CesA proteins essential for cellulose synthesis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=100|page=1450|year=2003|doi=10.1073/pnas.0337628100|issue=3 }}</ref> Separate sets of ''CesA'' genes are involved in primary and secondary cell wall biosynthesis.

Cellulose synthesis requires chain initiation and elongation, and the two processes are separate.
''CesA'' [[glucosyltransferase]] initiates cellulose polymerization using a [[steroid]] primer, [[beta-sitosterol|sitosterol]]-beta-[[glucoside]], and UDP-glucose.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=L|last2=Kawagoe|first2=Y|last3=Hogan|first3=P|last4=Delmer|first4=D|title=Sitosterol-beta-glucoside as primer for cellulose synthesis in plants|journal=Science|volume=295|issue=5552|pages=147–50|year=2002|pmid=11778054|doi=10.1126/science.1064281}}</ref> [[cellulose synthase (UDP-forming)|Cellulose synthase]] utilizes [[Uridine diphosphate|UDP]]-D-glucose precursors to elongate the growing cellulose chain. A [[cellulase]] may function to cleave the primer from the mature chain.

Cellulose is also synthesised by animals, particularly in the [[test (biology)|test]]s of [[ascidian]]s (where the cellulose was historically termed "tunicine") although it is also a minor component of [[mammal]]ian [[connective tissue]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Endean, R|url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/s3-102/57/107.full.pdf |title=The Test of the Ascidian, ''Phallusia mammillata''|journal= Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science|volume=102|issue=1|pages=107–117|year= 1961}}</ref>

=== Breakdown (cellulolysis) ===

Cellulolysis is the process of breaking down cellulose into smaller polysaccharides called [[cellodextrin]]s or completely into glucose units; this is a [[hydrolysis]] reaction. Because cellulose molecules bind strongly to each other, cellulolysis is relatively difficult compared to the breakdown of other polysaccharides.<ref>{{cite web|author=Barkalow, David G. and Whistler, Roy L.|title=Cellulose|publisher= AccessScience, McGraw-Hill|url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=118200&referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d118200}}</ref> However, this process can be significantly intensified in a proper solvent, e.g. in an ionic liquid.
<ref name=Synthesis of glucose esters from cellulose in ionic liquids>{{cite journal|last=Ignatyev|first=Igor|coauthors=Charlie Van Doorslaer, Pascal G.N. Mertens, Koen Binnemans, Dirk. E. de Vos|journal=Holzforschung|year=2011|volume=66|issue=4|pages=417-425|title=Synthesis of glucose esters from cellulose in ionic liquids|doi=10.1515/hf.2011.161|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/hfsg.2012.66.issue-4/hf.2011.161/hf.2011.161.xml}}</ref> 
Most mammals have only very limited ability to digest dietary fibres such as cellulose. Some [[ruminant]]s like cows and sheep contain certain [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria (like ''[[Cellulomonas]]'') in the flora of the rumen, and these bacteria produce [[enzyme]]s called [[cellulase]]s that help the microorganism to break down cellulose; the breakdown products are then used by the bacteria for proliferation. The bacterial mass is later digested by the ruminant in its digestive system (stomach and small intestine). Similarly, lower [[termite]]s contain in their [[hindgut]]s certain [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]] which produce such enzymes; higher termites contain bacteria for the job. Some termites may also produce cellulase of their own.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Hidden cellulases in termites: revision of an old hypothesis|journal=Biology Letters|volume=3|pages=336–339|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0073|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/3/336.long|date=22 June 2007|author8=Tokuda, Gaku and Hirofumi Watanabe|issue=3|pmid=17374589|last1=Tokuda|first1=G|last2=Watanabe|first2=H|pmc=2464699|postscript=<!-- None -->}}</ref> [[Fungus|Fungi]], which in nature are responsible for recycling of nutrients, are also able to break down cellulose.

The enzymes utilized to [[wikt:cleave|cleave]] the [[glycosidic linkage]] in cellulose are [[glycoside hydrolase]]s including endo-acting [[cellulase]]s and exo-acting [[glucosidase]]s. Such enzymes are usually secreted as part of multienzyme complexes that may include [[dockerin]]s and [[carbohydrate-binding module]]s.<ref name=Bras>{{Cite journal

== Hemicellulose ==
{{Main|Hemicellulose}}
[[Hemicellulose]] is a [[polysaccharide]] related to cellulose that comprises about 20% of the biomass of most plants. In contrast to cellulose, hemicellulose is derived from several sugars in addition to [[glucose]], especially [[xylose]] but also including [[mannose]], [[galactose]], [[rhamnose]], and [[arabinose]]. Hemicellulose consists of shorter chains&nbsp;– around 200 sugar units. Furthermore, hemicellulose is branched, whereas cellulose is unbranched.

== Derivatives ==

The [[hydroxyl]] groups (-OH) of cellulose can be partially or fully reacted with various [[reagent]]s to afford derivatives with useful properties like mainly cellulose [[ester]]s and cellulose [[ether]]s (-OR). In principle, though not always in current industrial practice, cellulosic polymers are renewable resources.

Ester derivatives include:

|}

The sodium carboxymethyl cellulose can be [[cross-linked]] to give the [[croscarmellose sodium]] (E468) for use as a [[Excipient|disintegrant]] in pharmaceutical formulations.

== Applications ==
[[File:Cotton.JPG|thumb|[[Cotton]] fibres represent the purest natural form of cellulose, containing more than 90% of this [[polysaccharide]].]]
{{see also|dissolving pulp|pulp (paper)}}

Cellulose for industrial use is mainly obtained from [[wood pulp]] and [[cotton]].<ref name="Klemm"/> The [[kraft process]] is used to separate cellulose from [[lignin]], another major component of plant matter.

=== Paper products ===

Cellulose is the major constituent of [[paper]], [[paperboard]], and [[card stock]].

=== Fibers ===

Cellulose is the main ingredient of [[textile]]s made from [[cotton]], [[linen]], and other [[plant fiber]]s. It can be turned into [[rayon]], an important fiber that has been used for textiles since the beginning of the 20th century. Both cellophane and rayon are known as "regenerated [[cellulose fiber]]s"; they are identical to cellulose in chemical structure and are usually made from [[dissolving pulp]] via [[viscose]]. A more recent and environmentally friendly method to produce a form of rayon is the [[Lyocell]] process.

=== Consumables ===

[[Microcrystalline cellulose]] ([[E number|E460i]]) and powdered cellulose (E460ii) are used as inactive [[Excipient#Fillers and diluents|fillers]] in drug tablets<ref>

and as thickeners and stabilizers in processed foods. Cellulose powder is for example used in [[Kraft Foods|Kraft's]][[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan cheese]] to prevent caking inside the tube.

=== Science ===

Cellulose is used in the laboratory as a stationary phase for [[Chromatography|thin layer chromatography]]. [[Cellulose fiber]]s are also used in liquid [[filtration]], sometimes in combination with [[diatomaceous earth]] or other filtration media, to create a filter bed of inert material.

=== Energy crops ===
{{Main|Energy crop}}
The major [[combustion|combustible]] component of non-food [[energy crop]]s is cellulose, with [[lignin]] second. Non-food energy crops produce more usable energy than edible energy crops (which have a large [[starch]] component), but still compete with food crops for agricultural land and water resources.<ref>Holt-Gimenez, Eric (2007). ''Biofuels: Myths of the Agrofuels Transition''. ''Backgrounder''. Institute for Food and Development Policy, Oakland, CA. 13:2 [http://www.foodfirst.org/en/node/2638] [http://www.foodfirst.org/fr/node/1712] </ref> Typical non-food energy crops include [[hemp|industrial hemp]] (though outlawed in some countries), [[switchgrass]], ''[[Miscanthus]]'', ''Salix''([[willow]]), and ''Populus'' ([[poplar]]) species.

TU-103, a strain of ''[[Clostridium]]'' bacteria found in Zebra waste, can convert nearly any form of cellulose into [[butanol]] fuel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_082511.cfm |title=Cars Could Run on Recycled Newspaper, Tulane Scientists Say |author=Kathryn Hobgood Ray |date=August 25, 2011 |work=Tulane University news webpage |publisher=Tulane University |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2012/01/zebra-butanol-biofuel/ |title=Put a Zebra in Your Tank: A Chemical Crapshoot? |author=Laurie Balbo |date=January 29, 2012 |work= |publisher=Greenprophet.com |accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref>

=== Building material ===

Hydroxyl bonding of cellulose in water produces a sprayable, moldable material as an alternative to the use of plastics and resins. The recyclable material can be made water- and fire-resistant. It provides sufficient strength for use as a building material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/zeoform-cellulose-water/28796 |title=Zeoform: The eco-friendly building material of the future? |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>

[[Cellulose insulation]] made from recycled paper is becoming popular as an environmentally preferable material for [[building insulation]]. It can be treated with [[boric acid]] as a [[fire retardant]].
 
=== Miscellaneous ===

Cellulose can be converted into [[cellophane]], a thin transparent film.

Cellulose is the raw material in the manufacture of [[nitrocellulose]] (cellulose nitrate) which is used in [[smokeless powder|smokeless gunpowder]]. It is the base material for the [[celluloid]] that was used for photographic and movie films until the mid-1930s.

Cellulose is used to make water-soluble [[adhesives]] and [[binder (material)|binders]] such as [[methyl cellulose]] and [[carboxymethyl cellulose]] which are used in [[wallpaper paste]].

Cellulose is further used to make [[hydrophilic]] and highly absorbent sponges.
