'''Dianetics''' is a set of ideas and practices regarding the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] relationship between the mind and body which was created by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and is practiced by followers of [[Scientology]] and separate independent Dianeticist groups.  Hubbard coined ''Dianetics'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] stems ''dia'', meaning "through," and ''nous'', meaning "[[mind]]".  Dianetics has achieved no acceptance as a [[scientific theory]], and is an example of a [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Dianetics divides the mind into three parts: the conscious "analytical mind," the subconscious "[[reactive mind]]," and the [[somatic]] mind.<ref>Encyclopedia of Religious Freedom, Catharine Cookson, Taylor & Francis, 2003, ISBN 0-415-94181-4.(page 430/431)</ref> The goal of Dianetics is to remove the "reactive mind," which [[Scientologists]] believe prevents people from becoming more ethical, more aware, happier and saner. The Dianetics procedure to achieve this is called "[[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]".<ref>Philosophers and Religious Leaders: An Encyclopedia of People Who Changed the World, Christian D. Von Dehsen & Scott L. Harris, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, ISBN 1-57356-152-5. (page 90).</ref> Auditing is a process whereby a series of questions are asked by the Scientology auditor, in an attempt to rid the audited person of the painful experiences of the past, which Scientologists believe to be the cause of the "reactive mind".

When Hubbard formulated Dianetics, he described it as "a mix of Western technology and Oriental philosophy".<ref name="James R.

==History==
{{Main|History of Dianetics}}
Hubbard always claimed that his ideas of Dianetics originated in the 1920s and 1930s. By his own account,<ref name="urban2006">Urban, Hugh B. "Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America." ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'' '''74''':2 (2006)</ref> he spent a great deal of time in the [[Naval Hospital Oakland|Oak Knoll Naval Hospital's]] library, where he would have encountered the work of Freud and other [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]]. In April 1950, Hubbard and several others established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] to coordinate work related for the forthcoming publication. Hubbard first introduced Dianetics to the public in the article ''[[Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science]]'' published in the May 1950 issue of the magazine ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''.<ref name="Creation">{{cite web | url = http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/skent/creation.htm?FACTNet#txtref02 | title = The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology | publisher = Religious Studies and Theology | accessdate = 2006-05-08}} Originally published by Stephen A. Kent in December, 1999.</ref> Hubbard wrote ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' at that time, allegedly completing the 180,000-word book in six weeks.<ref>"L.R.H. Biography," Sea Org Flag Information Letter 67, 31 October 1977</ref>

The success of selling ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' brought in a flood of money, which Hubbard used to establish Dianetics foundations in six major American cities. The scientific and medical communities were far less enthusiastic about Dianetics, viewing it with bemusement, concern, or outright derision. Complaints were made against local Dianetics practitioners for allegedly practicing medicine without a license. This eventually prompted Dianetics advocates to disclaim any medicinal benefits in order to avoid regulation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Hubbard explained the backlash as a response from various entities trying to co-opt Dianetics for their own use. Hubbard blamed the hostile press coverage in particular on a plot by the [[American Communist Party]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} In later years, Hubbard decided that the psychiatric profession was the origin of all of the criticism of Dianetics, as he believed it secretly controlled most of the world's governments.<ref>Hubbard, "Ron's Journal 67," taped message of 20 September 1969</ref>

By the autumn of 1950, financial problems had developed, and by November 1950, the six foundations had spent around one million dollars and were more than $200,000 in debt.<ref>''Dianetics and the Professions'', A.E. van Vogt, 1953</ref> Disagreements emerged over the direction of the Dianetic Foundation's work, and relations between the board members became strained, with several leaving, even to support causes critical of Dianetics. One example was [[Harvey Jackins]], founder of [[Re-evaluation Counseling#Origins of RC as an adaptation of Dianetics|Re-evaluation Counselling]], originally a sort of discrete reworking of Dianetics, which L Ron Hubbard later declared [[Suppressive Person|suppressive]] to Scientology.

In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth for teaching medicine without a licence.<ref>''Bulletin of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation'', Elizabeth, NJ. January 1951</ref> The Foundation closed its doors, causing the proceedings to be vacated, but its creditors began to demand settlement of its outstanding debts. Don Purcell, a millionaire Dianeticist from [[Wichita, Kansas]], offered a brief respite from bankruptcy, but the Foundation's finances failed again in 1952.<ref name="barefaced">{{cite book | author=Miller, Russell | authorlink=Russell Miller| title=Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L.

Bankrolling and Bankruptcy | chapterurl=http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfm11.htm}}</ref>

Because of a sale of assets resulting from the bankruptcy, Hubbard no longer owned the rights to the name "Dianetics",<ref name="barefaced"/> but its philosophical framework still provided the seed for Scientology to grow. Scientologists refer to the book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' as "Book One." In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as "Scientology, a religious philosophy." Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas: Where the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his [[reactive mind]] [[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], the stated goal of Scientology is to rehabilitate the individual's spiritual nature so that he may reach his full potential.

In 1978, Hubbard released ''New Era Dianetics'' (NED), a revised version supposed to produce better results in a shorter period of time. The course consists of 11 [[rundown (Scientology)|rundowns]] and requires a specifically trained auditor.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.auditing.org/13-ned.htm| title=New Era Dianetics Auditing| accessdate=2006-10-05}}</ref> It is run (processed) exactly like Standard Dianetics, widely practiced before the advent of NED, except the pre-clear (parishioner) is encouraged to find the "postulate" he made as a result of the incident.<ref>L. Ron Hubbard ''New Era Dianetics Series 7RA'', HCOB 28 June 1978RA revised 15 September 1978, Hubbard Communications Office (HCO).</ref>  ("Postulate" in Dianetics and Scientology has the meaning of "a conclusion, decision or resolution made by the individual himself; to conclude, decide or resolve a problem or to set a pattern for the future or to nullify a pattern of the past"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.ie/p_jpg/wis/wiseng/gloss.htm#p |title=The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary |publisher=Scientology.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref> in contrast to its conventional meanings.)

New Era Dianetics is really only a prelude to what is available at the high levels of the Bridge including the [[incident (Scientology)|incidents]]: New Era Dianetics for [[OT (Scientology)|OTs]] also known as [[NOTs|NOTS]]. It is available after the now well known [[Operating Thetan Level III|First Wall of Fire]]. NOTS is also known as the [[Operating Thetan#OT V: New Era Dianetics for OTs|Second Wall of Fire]].

==Basic concepts==
In the book, ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'', Hubbard describes techniques that he suggests can rid individuals of fears and psychosomatic illnesses. A basic idea in Dianetics is that the mind consists of two parts: the "analytical mind" and the "[[reactive mind]]." The "reactive mind", the mind which operates when a person is physically unconscious, acts as a record of shock, trauma, pain, and otherwise harmful memories. Experiences such as these, stored in the "reactive mind" are dubbed "[[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]". Dianetics is a proposed method to erase these "engrams" in the "reactive mind" to achieve what is referred to in Scientology as a state of "Clear". A "Clear" is one who is thought to no longer possess his reactive mind.<ref name="James R. Lewis 1997, page 287"/>

By his own admission, Hubbard made what he considered was one of the greatest mistakes of his life when he used the biological definition of engram as a "trace on a cell", which was not in line with the proper [[biology|biological]] definition.<ref>[[Pitirim Alexandrovich Sorokin]] ''The Ways and Power of Love'', pp. 186-187, Templeton Foundation Press, 2002 ISBN 978-1-890151-86-7; first edition 1954: Harvard Research Center in Creative Altruism</ref>

Hubbard described Dianetics as "an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of [[natural law]]s on the order of those of the physical sciences".<ref>Winter, J.A. ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 18 (Julian Press, 1987 reprint)</ref> These Dianetic "axioms" can be found in Hubbard books such as ''Scientology 0-8: The Book of Basics'' and ''Advanced Procedure and Axioms''. Unlike conventional therapies, Hubbard said, Dianetics would work every time if applied properly and "will invariably cure all psychosomatic ills and human aberrations."{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In April 1950, before the public release of Dianetics, he wrote: "To date, over two hundred patients have been treated; of those two hundred, two hundred cures have been obtained."<ref>Hubbard, "Dianetics". ''Astounding Science Fiction'', May 1950.</ref>

In Dianetics, the unconscious or reactive mind is described as a collection of "mental image pictures," which contain the recorded experience of past moments of unconsciousness, including all sensory perceptions and feelings involved, ranging from [[pre-natal]] experiences, infancy and childhood, even the traumatic feelings associated events from past lives and alien cultures. The type of mental image picture created during a period of [[unconsciousness]] involves the exact recording of a painful experience. Hubbard called this phenomenon an [[engram (Dianetics)|engram]], and defined it as "a complete recording of a moment of unconsciousness containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions."<ref>[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]] page 79 and Glossary</ref>

Hubbard proposed that, via pain, physical or mental traumas caused "aberrations" (deviations from rational thinking) in the mind, which produced adverse physical and emotional effects. The conscious or analytical mind, out of a desire for survival, would instinctively shut down during moments of stress. The memories recorded during this period would be stored as engrams in the unconscious or reactive mind.  (In Hubbard's earliest publications on the subject, engrams were variously referred to as "Norns",<ref name="Creation"/> "Impediments," and "comanomes" before "engram" was adapted from its existing usage at the suggestion of [[Joseph Winter]].)<ref name="Blue Sky">{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X| page=109}}</ref> Some commentators noted Dianetics' blend of science fiction and [[occult]] orientations at the time.<ref name="Creation"/>

Dianetics claims that these engrams are the cause of almost all psychological and physical problems. In addition to containing the experience of physical pain, engrams can also include words or phrases overheard by the patient while he was unconscious. For instance, Winter cites the example of a patient with a persistent headache supposedly tracing the problem to a doctor saying "Take him now" during the preclear's birth. (wordy/unclear) <ref>Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 165</ref>  Hubbard similarly claims that the cause of [[leukemia]] is traceable to "an engram containing the phrase 'It turns my blood to water.'"<ref>Hubbard, ''A History of Man'', p.20. American Saint Hill Organization, 1968</ref>  While it is sometimes claimed that the Church of Scientology no longer stands by Hubbard's claims that Dianetics can treat physical conditions, it still publishes them:  "... when the knee injuries of the past are located and discharged, the [[arthritis]] ceases, no other injury takes its place and the person is finished with arthritis of the knee."<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron. [http://www.smi.org/route/page06.htm "The Discoveries of Dianetics"].  Retrieved 22 April 2006.</ref> "[The reactive mind] can give a man arthritis, [[bursitis]], [[asthma]], [[allergy|allergies]], [[sinusitis]], [[Coronary circulation|coronary]] trouble, high [[blood pressure]] ... And it is the only thing in the human being which can produce these effects ... Discharge the content of [the reactive mind] and the arthritis vanishes, [[myopia]] gets better, heart illness decreases, asthma disappears, stomachs function properly and the whole catalog of ills goes away and stays away."<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron. [http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/info/01/pg003.html "What is the Reactive Mind?"].  Retrieved 28 April 2006.</ref>

Some of the [[psychometrics|psychometric]] ideas in Dianetics can be traced to [[Sigmund Freud]], whom Hubbard credited as an inspiration and was said to have used as a source.<ref>Letter from John W. Campbell, cited in Winter, p. 3 - "His approach is, actually, based on some very early work of Freud"</ref> Freud had speculated 40 years previously that traumas with similar content join together in "chains," embedded in the unconscious mind, to cause irrational responses in the individual. Such a chain would be relieved by inducing the patient to remember the earliest trauma, "with an accompanying expression of emotion."<ref>Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud, "Studies in Hysteria", Vol II of the ''Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Hogarth Press, London (1955).</ref><ref>L. Ron Hubbard ''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', PAB 92, 10 July 1956.</ref>

According to Bent Corydon, Hubbard created the illusion that Dianetics was the first [[psychotherapy]] to address [[traumatic experience]]s in their own time, but others had done so as standard procedure.

One treatment method Hubbard drew from in developing Dianetics was [[abreaction therapy]].  [[Abreaction]] is a [[psychoanalytical]] [[technical terminology|term]] that means bringing to [[consciousness]], and thus adequate expression, material that has been unconscious." It includes not only the recollection of forgotten memories and [[experience]], but also their reliving with appropriate emotional display and discharge of effect. This process is usually facilitated by the patient's gaining awareness of the [[causal relationship]] between the previously undischarged [[emotion]] and his [[symptom]]s."<ref>Bent Corydon ''L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?'', pp. 283-4, Barricade Books Inc., 1992 ISBN 0-942637-57-7</ref>

According to Hubbard, before Dianetics psychotherapists may have been able to deal with very light and superficial incidents (e.g. an incident that reminds you of a moment of loss), but with Dianetic therapy, the patient can actually erase moments of pain and unconsciousness. He emphasizes: "The discovery of the engram is entirely the property of Dianetics. Methods of its erasure are also owned entirely by Dianetics..."<ref>''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', ibid. Pab 92</ref>

With the use of Dianetics techniques, Hubbard claimed, the reactive mind could be processed and all stored engrams could be refiled as experience. The central technique was "auditing," a two-person [[talk therapy|question-and-answer therapy]] designed to isolate and dissipate engrams (or "mental masses"). An auditor addresses questions to a subject, observes and records the subject's responses, and returns repeatedly to experiences or areas under discussion that appear painful until the troubling experience has been identified and confronted. Through repeated applications of this method, the reactive mind could be "cleared" of its content having outlived its usefulness in the [[Process (science)|process]] of [[evolution]]; a person who has completed this process would be "Clear".

The benefits of going Clear, according to Hubbard, were dramatic. A Clear would have no compulsions, repressions, [[psychosis|psychoses]] or [[neurosis|neuroses]], and would enjoy a near-perfect memory as well as a rise in [[IQ]] of as much as 50 points. He also claimed that "the atheist is activated by engrams as thoroughly as the zealot".<ref>Hubbard, "Dianetics and Religion," ''Dianetic Auditor's Bulletin'' vol. 1 no. 4, October 1950</ref> He further claimed that widespread application of Dianetics would result in "A world without [[insanity]], without criminals and without war."<ref>Hubbard, ''Science of Survival: Prediction of Human Behavior'' p. 1, Bridge Publications, 1990 (reissue).</ref>

According to the Scientology journal ''The Auditor'', the total number of "Clears" as of May 2006 stands at 50,311.<ref>"The Auditor," The Monthly Journal of Scientology, published by the American Saint Hill Organization, 1413 L. Ron Hubbard Way, Los Angeles, CA 90027, Issue 330, May 2006, page 7.</ref>

==Scientific evaluation and criticisms==

Hubbard's original book on Dianetics attracted highly critical reviews from science and medical writers and organizations. The [[American Psychological Association]] passed a resolution in 1950 calling "attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by [[empiricism|empirical]] evidence of the sort required for the establishment of scientific generalizations."<ref>"Psychologists Act Against Dianetics", ''New York Times'', 9 September 1950</ref><ref name=timeapa>{{cite news | title = Tests &amp; Poison | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813284,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 1950-09-18 | accessdate = 2008-02-10 }}</ref> Subsequently, Dianetics has achieved no acceptance as a [[scientific theory]] and scientists cite Dianetics as an example of a [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=":0">See e.g. Gardner, ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''; Bauer, ''Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method'' and ''Science Or Pseudoscience: Magnetic Healing, Psychic Phenomena, and Other Heterodoxies''; Corsini ''et al.'', ''The Dictionary of Psychology''.</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite book|chapter=Demise of the Dogmatic Universe|title=Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences|author=Ari Ben-Menahem|isbn=978-3-540-68831-0|year=2009|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-68832-7|pages=4301–4302}}</ref>

Few scientific investigations into the effectiveness of Dianetics have been published. Professor [[John A. Lee (professor)|John A. Lee]] states in his 1970 evaluation of Dianetics:

:Objective experimental verification of Hubbard's [[physiology|physiological]] and psychological doctrines is lacking. To date, no regular scientific agency has established the validity of his theories of prenatal perception and engrams, or cellular memory, or Dianetic reverie, or the effects of Scientology auditing routines. Existing knowledge contradicts Hubbard's theory of recording of perceptions during periods of unconsciousness.<ref>Lee, John A. ''Sectarian Healers and Hypnotherapy'', 1970, Ontario</ref>

The [[MEDLINE]] database records two independent scientific studies on Dianetics, both conducted in the 1950s under the auspices of [[New York University]]. Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetics therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not effect any significant changes in intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or the degree of personality conflicts;<ref>Fischer, Harvey Jay. "Dianetic therapy: an experimental evaluation. A statistical analysis of the effect of dianetic therapy as measured by group tests of intelligence, mathematics and personality." Abstract of Ph.D. thesis, 1953, New York University ([http://home.snafu.de/tilman/krasel/dianetics_test2.html Excerpt])</ref> Jack Fox tested Hubbard's thesis regarding recall of engrams, with the assistance of the Dianetic Research Foundation, and could not substantiate it.<ref>Fox, J.; Davis, A.E.; Lebovits, B. "An experimental investigation of Hubbard's engram hypothesis (dianetics)". ''Psychological Newsletter'', New York University. 10 1959, 131-134</ref>

Hubbard claimed, in an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'' in November 1950, that "he had already submitted proof of claims made in the book to a number of scientists and associations." He added that the public as well as proper organizations were entitled to such proof and that he was ready and willing to give such proof in detail.<ref>"Psychologists Act Against Dianetics", New York Times, 9 September 1950</ref> In January 1951, the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation of [[Elizabeth, NJ]] published ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', a booklet providing the results of psychometric tests conducted on 88 people undergoing Dianetics therapy. It presents case histories and a number of [[X-ray]] plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured "aberrations" including [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], asthma, [[arthritis]], [[colitis]] and "overt homosexuality," and that after Dianetic processing, test subjects experienced significantly increased scores on a standardized IQ test. The report's subjects are not identified by name, but one of them is clearly Hubbard himself ("Case 1080A, R. L.").<ref>Benton, Peggy; Ibanex, Dalmyra.; Southon, Gordon; Southon, Peggy. ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, 1951</ref>

The authors provide no qualifications, although they are described in Hubbard's book ''Science of Survival'' (where some results of the same study were reprinted) as psychotherapists. Critics of Dianetics are skeptical of this study, both because of the bias of the source and because the researchers appear to ascribe all physical benefits to Dianetics without considering possible outside factors; in other words, the report lacks any [[scientific control]]s. J.A. Winter, M.D., originally an associate of Hubbard and an early adopter of Dianetics, had by the end of 1950 cut his ties with Hubbard and written an account of his personal experiences with Dianetics. He described Hubbard as "absolutistic and authoritarian",<ref name=departure/> and criticized the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for failing to undertake "precise scientific research into the functioning of the mind".<ref>Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 40</ref> He also recommended that auditing be done by experts only and that it was dangerous for laymen to audit each other.<ref name=departure>{{cite news | title = Departure in Dianetics | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821638,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 1951-09-03 | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}</ref> Hubbard writes: "Again, Dianetics is not being released to a profession, for no profession could encompass it."<ref>L. Ron Hubbard ''Dianetics: the Modernd Science of Mental Health'', p. 204, Bridge Publications Inc., 2007 ISBN 978-1-4031-4484-3; 1st ed. 1950</ref>

Commentators from a variety of backgrounds have described Dianetics as an example of pseudoscience&mdash;that is, information presented as scientific that fails to meet the criteria for science. For example, [[philosophy]] professor [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]] points to Dianetics' lack of empirical evidence:

:What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn't even clear what such "data" would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations ... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science.<ref>[[Robert Todd Carroll|Carroll, Robert T.]] [http://skepdic.com/dianetic.html "Dianetics"], ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''</ref>

[[W. Sumner Davis]] similarly comments that

:Dianetics is nothing more than an example of pseudoscience trying to legitimize itself ... Hubbard, had he indeed been a scientist, would have known that truth is not built on axioms, and facts cannot be found from some a-priori knowledge. A true science is constructed on [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], which are arrived at by the virtue of observed phenomena. Scientific knowledge is gained by observation and testing, not believing from some [[subconscious]] stipulation, as Hubbard would have us believe.<ref>Davis, W. Sumner.

==Procedure in practice==
[[File:Dianetics demo at Union Station.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Scientologist]]s promoting Dianetics at [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] in Washington, D.C.]]
The procedure of Dianetics therapy (known as ''auditing'') is a two-person activity. One person, the "auditor", guides the other person, the "preclear". The preclear's job is to look at the mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the preclear says and controls the process so the preclear may put his full attention on his work.

The auditor and preclear sit down in chairs facing each other. The process then follows in eleven distinct steps:<ref>This description is based on "[http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html The Dianetics Procedure - 10 Simple Steps]"</ref>

:1. The auditor assures the preclear that he will be fully aware of everything that happens during the session.

:2. The preclear is instructed to close his eyes for the session, entering a state of "dianetic reverie", signified by "a tremble of the lashes". During the session, the preclear remains in full possession of his will and retains full recall thereafter.

:3. The auditor installs a "canceller", an instruction intended to absolutely cancel any form of positive suggestion that could accidentally occur. This is done by saying "In the future, when I utter the word 'cancelled,' everything I have said to you while you are in a therapy session will be cancelled and will have no force with you. Any suggestion I may have made to you will be without force when I say the word 'cancelled.' Do you understand?"

:4. The auditor then asks the preclear to locate an exact record of something that happened to the preclear in his past: "Locate an incident that you feel you can comfortably face."

:5. The preclear is invited by the auditor to "Go through the incident and say what is happening as you go along."

:6a. The auditor instructs the preclear to recall as much as possible of the incident, going over it several times "until the preclear is cheerful about it".

:6b. When the preclear is cheerful about an incident, the auditor instructs the preclear to locate another incident: "Let's find another incident that you feel you can comfortably face." The process outlined at steps 5 and 6a then repeats until the auditing session's time limit (usually two hours or so) is reached.

:7. The preclear is then instructed to "return to present time".

:8. The auditor checks to make sure that the preclear feels himself to be in "present time", i.e., not still recalling a past incident.

:9. The auditor gives the preclear the canceller word: "Very good. Cancelled."

:10. The auditor tells the preclear to feel alert and return to full awareness of his surroundings: "When I count from five to one and snap my fingers you will feel alert. Five, four, three, two, one." (snaps fingers)

Auditing sessions are kept confidential. This has come into question, though, that confidential information has been used to blackmail possible defectors (see [[Church of Scientology|Fair Game]]). A few transcripts of auditing sessions with [[Sanitization (classified information)|confidential information removed]] have been published as demonstration examples. Some extracts can be found in Dr. J.A. Winter's book ''[[Dianetics: A Doctor's Report]]''. Other, more comprehensive, transcripts of auditing sessions carried out by Hubbard himself can be found in volume 1 of the ''Research & Discovery Series'' (Bridge Publications, 1980). Examples of public group processing sessions can be found throughout the ''Congresses'' lecture series.

According to Hubbard, auditing enables the preclear to "contact" and "release" engrams stored in the reactive mind, relieving him of the physical and mental aberrations connected with them. The preclear is asked to inspect and familiarize himself with the exact details of his own experience; the auditor may not tell him anything about his case or evaluate any of the information the preclear finds.

The validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer [[Martin Gardner]] asserts that "nothing could be clearer from the above dialogue than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it."<ref>Gardner, Martin. '' Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''. Dover, 1957</ref>

Other critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of [[hypnosis]],<ref>"Never believe a hypnotist - An investigation of L. Ron Hubbard's statements about hypnosis and its relationship to his Dianetics.", Jon Atack</ref><ref>"Psychologist says church appeared to use hypnosis", ''Irish Times'', 13 March 2003</ref><ref>"The 'Scientology Organization' (SO) as of July 2003", chapter 2, Landesamt für Verfassungsschutz Baden-Wuerttemberg, 2003</ref> although the Church of Scientology has strongly denied that hypnosis forms any part of Dianetics.<ref>"[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/news-media/faq/pg005.html What is auditing?]", Church of Scientology International</ref> To the contrary, L. Ron Hubbard expressly warns not to use any hypnosis or hypnosis-like methods, because a person under hypnosis would be receptive to suggestions. This would decrease his self-determinism instead of increasing it, which is one of the prime goals of Dianetics.<ref>"[[Science of Survival]]", L. Ron Hubbard, p. 461 (2007 edition).</ref> Winter [1950] comments that the leading nature of the questions asked of a preclear "encourage fantasy", a common issue also encountered with hypnosis, which can be used to form [[confabulation|false memories]]. The auditor is instructed not to make any assessment of a recalled memory's reality or accuracy, but instead to treat it as if it were objectively real. Professor [[Richard Ofshe|Richard J. Ofshe]], a leading expert on false memories, suggests that the feeling of well-being reported by preclears at the end of an auditing session may be induced by post-hypnotic [[suggestion]].<ref>"A Very Brief Overview of Scientology", Richard E. Ofshe, Ph.D.</ref> According to Hubbard: "Laughter is definitely the relief of painful emotion."<ref>''Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health'', ibid. p. 147</ref>

==Autocontrol==
According to Hubbard, the majority of the people interested in the subject believed they could accomplish therapy alone. "It cannot be done" and he adds: "If a patient places himself in [[Self-hypnosis|autohypnosis]] and regresses himself in an effort to reach illness or birth or prenatals, the only thing he will get is ill".<ref>Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health -5oth anniversary edition- pp. 443-4.</ref>
