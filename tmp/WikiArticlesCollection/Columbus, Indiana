It is also the principal city of the Columbus, Indiana, [[metropolitan statistical area]] which encompasses all of Bartholomew County.

Columbus is currently ranked 11th in the US on the list of safest cities per population.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} [[National Geographic Traveler]] ranked Columbus 11th on its historic destinations list in late 2008, describing the city as "authentic, unique, and unspoiled."<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Destinations Rated – North America|url=http://traveler.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/historic-destinations-rated/north-america-text/8|publisher=National Geographic Traveler|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> Columbus won the national contest "America in Bloom" in 2006,<ref>{{cite news|last=Minnis|first=Paul|title=Columbus wins America in Bloom|url=http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.net/main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID=62&ArticleID=29639|accessdate=July 23, 2011|newspaper=The Republic|date=October 2, 2006}}</ref> and in 2004 it was named one of "The Ten Most Playful Towns" by [[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Jr.]] Family Magazine.<ref>{{cite news|title=Top Ten Playful Towns in America Revealed Today by Nick Jr. Magazine|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/top-ten-playful-towns-in-america-revealed-today-by-nick-jr-family-magazine-72159072.html|accessdate=July 23, 2011|newspaper=PR Newswire|date=March 22, 2004}}</ref> The July 2005 edition of [[GQ Magazine]] named Columbus one of the "62 Reasons to Love Your Country."<ref>{{cite web|title=Columbus features in national publications|url=http://columbus.in.us/static/index.cfm?contentID=489|publisher=Columbus, Indiana Convention and Visitors Bureau|accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref> Columbus is the headquarters of the engine company [[Cummins|Cummins, Inc.]]

==History==
The land which is now Columbus was bought by General [[John Tipton]] and Luke Bonesteel in 1820. General Tipton built a log cabin on Mt. Tipton, a small hill overlooking [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] and the surrounding flat, heavily forested and swampy valley. The town was known as Tiptonia, named in honor of General Tipton. The town's name was changed to Columbus on March 20, 1821. General Tipton was upset by the name change and decided to leave the newly founded town. He later became the Highway Commissioner for the [[State of Indiana]] and was assigned to building a highway from [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]] to [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. When the road reached Columbus, Tipton constructed the first bypass road ever built; it detoured south around the west side of Columbus en route to [[Seymour, Indiana|Seymour]].

Joseph McKinney was the first to plot the town of Columbus, but no date was recorded.

It was recorded for years in the local history books that the land on which Columbus sits was donated by General Tipton; however, a deed purporting to show a sale of the land was acquired in 2003 by [http://www.historiccolumbusindiana.org Historic Columbus Indiana]. The deed indicated that General Tipton actually sold the land.

A ferry was established to avoid crossing both the [[Flatrock River|Flatrock]] and Driftwood rivers, which join only a short distance above the site of the ferry. This became a village of three or four log cabins, and a store was added in 1821. Later that year, Bartholomew County was organized by an act of the [[Indiana General Assembly|State Legislature]] and named to honor the famous Hoosier militiaman, [[Joseph Bartholomew (General)|General Joseph Bartholomew]]. Columbus was incorporated on June 28, 1864.

The first railroad in Indiana reached Columbus from [[Madison, Indiana]] in 1844. This was the Madison branch of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. The railroad fostered the growth of the community into one of the largest communities in Indiana, and three more railroads reached the city by 1850.

Columbus is host to the oldest theater in the State of Indiana, the [http://www.historiccolumbusindiana.org/jscrump.htm Crump Theatre], which was built in 1889 by John Crump. Today the building is an historical landmark and an all-ages venue with occasional musical performances. Columbus also is host to the former oldest continually operated bookstore in Indiana: Cummins Bookstore. The bookstore first began operations in 1892 and closed in late 2007.

The Irwin Union Bank building was built in 1954. It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[National Park Service]] in 2001 in recognition of its unique architecture. The building consists of a one-story bank structure adjacent to a three-story office annex. A portion of the office annex was built along with the banking hall in 1954. The remaining larger portion, designed by [[Roche-Dinkeloo|Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates]], was built in 1973. [[Eero Saarinen]] designed the bank building with its glazed hall to be set off against the blank background of its three-story brick annex. Two steel and glass vestibule connectors lead from the north side of this structure to the annex. The building was designed to distance the [[Irwin Union Bank and Trust|Irwin Union Bank]] from traditional banking architecture, which mostly echoed imposing, neoclassical style buildings of brick or stone. Tellers were behind iron bars and removed from their customers. Saarinen worked to develop a building that would welcome customers rather than intimidate them.

Columbus has been home to many manufacturing companies, including Noblitt-Sparks Industries (which built radios under the Arvin brand in the 1930s)<ref>McMahon, Morgan E. ''A Flick of the Switch 1930–1950'' (Antiques Electronics Supply, 1990), pp.58–9.</ref> and Arvin Industries, now [[Meritor|Meritor, Inc.]] After merging with Meritor Automotive on July 10, 2000, the headquarters of the newly created ArvinMeritor Industries was established in Troy, Michigan, the home of parent company, [[Rockwell International]].

Just south of Columbus are the North American headquarters of [http://www.toyota-industries.com/corporateinfo/overseas/tina.html Toyota Industries], the world's largest material handling ([[Forklift truck|forklift]]) manufacturer. Other notable industries include architecture, a discipline for which Columbus is famous worldwide. The late [[J. Irwin Miller]] (then president and chairman of [[Cummins|Cummins Engine Company]]) launched the Cummins Foundation, a charitable program that helps subsidize a large number of architectural projects throughout the city by up-and-coming engineers and architects.

Early in the 20th century, Columbus also was home to a number of pioneering car manufacturers, including [[Milton Reeves|Reeves]], which produced the unusual four-axle [[Octoauto]] and the twin rear axle Sextoauto, both around 1911.<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925''. (New York: Bonanza, 1950), p.122-4.</ref>

Because Columbus is far enough from Indianapolis, it benefits tremendously from nearby commuters who recognize Columbus as a major city in its own right. Nearly 19,000 workers commute into the city from the surrounding townships and villages.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} In recent years city officials have explored ways to revitalize the city and return Columbus to the days when Miller's architectural innovation made it one of the most envied cities in the US. Economic development, widespread beautification innovations, various tax incentives, and increased law enforcement have helped Columbus overcome what some considered a slump during the 1980s and 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Columbus is a city known for its [http://www.columbus.in.us/listings/index.cfm?catId=336 architecture]. [[J. Irwin Miller]], 2nd CEO and a nephew of a Co-Founder of [[Cummins|Cummins Inc.]], the Columbus-headquartered diesel engine manufacturer, instituted a program in which the Cummins company paid the architects' fee, provided the client selected a firm from a list compiled by Miller. The plan was initiated with public schools and was so successful that Miller decided to defray the design costs of fire stations, public housing, and other community structures. The high number of notable public buildings and [[List of public art in Columbus, Indiana|sculptures]] in the Columbus area, designed by such individuals as [[Eero Saarinen]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Cesar Pelli]], and [[Richard Meier]] have led to Columbus earning the nickname "Athens of the Prairie."<ref>http://www.taglineguru.com/mottolist.html</ref> Six buildings, built between 1942 and 1965, are [[National Historic Landmark]]s, and approximately 60 other buildings sustain the Bartholomew County seat's reputation as a showcase of modern architecture. [[National Geographic Magazine]] once devoted an entire article to the town's architecture.
