'''Asteraceae''' or '''Compositae''' (commonly referred to as the '''aster''', '''daisy''', or '''sunflower family''') is an exceedingly large and widespread [[family (biology)|family]] of [[Angiospermae]].<ref name="Stevens">Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards) ''Angiosperm Phylogeny Website''. Version 9, June 2008 http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/welcome.html</ref><ref>Jeffrey, C. 2007. Compositae: Introduction with key to tribes. Pages 61-87 in Families and Genera of Vascular Plants, vol. VIII, Flowering Plants, Eudicots, Asterales (J. W. Kadereit and C. Jeffrey, eds.). Springer-Verlag, Berlin</ref> The group has more than 23,000 currently accepted species, spread across 1,620 genera ([[List of Asteraceae genera|list]]) and 12 subfamilies. In terms of numbers of species, Asteraceae is rivaled only by [[Orchidaceae]].<ref name="Stevens"/><ref name="Panero & Crozier">Panero, J.L., Crozier, B.S. ''Tree of Life - Asteraceae'' http://tolweb.org/Asteraceae/20780</ref> (Which of the two families is actually larger is unclear, owing to uncertainty about exactly how many species exist in each family). The main feature of the family is the [[composite flower]] type in the form of [[Flower head|capitula]] surrounded by [[bract#Involucral bracts|involucral bracts]]. The name "Asteraceae" comes from Aster, the most prominent genus in the family, that derives from the Greek ''ἀστήρ'' meaning star, and is connected with its inflorescence star form. As for the term "Compositae", more ancient but still valid, it obviously makes reference to the fact that the family is one of the few angiosperms that have composite flowers.<ref>[http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/main.htm International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. ] In point 18/5 states: "The following names, used traditionally, are considered valid: Compositae (Asteraceae...).</ref> This family has a remarkable ecological and economical importance, and is present from the polar regions to the tropics, colonizing all available habitats. The Asteraceae may represent as much as 10% of [[Autochthon (nature)|autochthonous]] flora in many regions of the world.

Most members of Asteraceae are herbaceous, but a significant number are also shrubs, vines and trees.  The family has a worldwide distribution, and is most common in the [[arid]] and semi-arid regions of subtropical and lower temperate latitudes.<ref name="Barkley et al.">Barkely, T.M., Brouillet, L., Strother, J.L. (2006) ''Flora of North America - Asteraceae" http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=10074</ref>

Asteraceae is an economically important family. Some members provide products including [[cooking oil]]s, [[lettuce]], [[sunflower seed]]s, [[artichoke]]s, [[sweetening agent]]s, coffee substitutes and [[tisane|herbal tea]]s.  Several genera are popular with the [[horticulture|horticultural]] community, including [[marigold (common)|marigold]], [[Calendula|pot marigold]] (also known as calendula), cone flowers, various daisies, [[Erigeron|fleabane]], [[chrysanthemum]]s, [[dahlia]]s, [[zinnia]]s, and [[helenium]]s. Asteraceae are important in herbal medicine, including [[Grindelia]], [[Echinacea purpurea|echinacea]], [[Achillea millefolium|yarrow]] and many others.<ref name="Duke">[http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/ Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases]</ref> A number of species have come to be considered invasive, including, most notably in North America, [[Taraxacum officinale|dandelion]], which was originally introduced by European settlers who used the young leaves as a salad green.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.invasiveplantatlas.org/subject.html?sub=3887 | title = dandelion Taraxacum officinale | accessdate = 2012-09-10 | work = Invasive Plant Atlas of the United States}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The Latin name 'Asteraceae' is derived from the type genus ''[[Aster (genus)|Aster]]'', which is a Greek term that means "star".<ref>Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Aster. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aster</ref>  'Compositae', an older but still valid name,<ref>International Code of Botanical Nomenclature - Article 18.5 http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/main.htm</ref> means ''composite'' and refers to the characteristic [[inflorescence]], a special type of [[pseudanthium]] found in only a few other [[angiosperm]] families. The study of this family is known as [[synantherology]].

The vernacular name ''daisy'', widely applied to members of this family, is derived from its Old English meaning, ''dægesege,'' from dæges eage meaning "day's eye," and this was because the petals (of ''[[Bellis perennis]]'') open at dawn and close at dusk.

==Distribution==
Asteraceae have a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], and are found everywhere except [[Antarctica]] and the extreme Arctic. They are especially numerous in tropical and subtropical regions (notably [[Central America]], eastern [[Brazil]], the [[Andes]], the [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], the Levant part of the Middle East, [[southern Africa]], [[central Asia]], and [[southwestern China]]).<ref name="Panero & Crozier"/>

==Taxonomy==
Compositae were first described in 1792 by the [[Germans|German]] botanist [[Paul Dietrich Giseke]].<ref>Solbrig, O.T. (1963) Subfamilial Nomenclature of Compositae. ''Taxon'' '''12''': 229-235 http://www.jstor.org/pss/1216917</ref>  Traditionally two subfamilies were recognised: ''[[Asteroideae]]'' (or ''Tubuliflorae'') and ''[[Cichorioideae]]'' (or ''Liguliflorae''). The latter has been shown to be extensively [[paraphyletic]], and has now been divided into 11 subfamilies, but the former still stands. The [[phylogenetic tree]] presented below is based on Panero & Funk (2002).<ref>Panero, J.L., Funk, V.A. (2002) [http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/110040#page/927/mode/1up Toward a phylogenetic subfamilial classification for the Compositae (Asteraceae)]. ''Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash.'' '''115''': 909-922.</ref> The diamond denotes a very poorly supported [[cladistics|node]] (<50% bootstrap support), the dot a poorly supported node (<80%).<ref name="Stevens"/>

It is noteworthy that the four subfamilies [[Asteroideae]], [[Cichorioideae]], [[Carduoideae]] and [[Mutisioideae]] contain 99% of the species diversity of the whole family (approximately 70%, 14%, 11% and 3% respectively).

Because of the [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] complexity exhibited by this family, agreeing on generic circumscriptions has often been difficult for [[taxonomist]]s.  As a result, several of these genera have required multiple revisions.<ref name="Judd">Judd, W.S., Campbell, C.S., Kellogg, E.A., Stevens, P.F. (2007) Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland.</ref>

==Characteristics==
Asteraceae are mostly [[herb]]aceous plants, but some shrubs, [[tree]]s and [[Vine|climber]]s do exist. Asteraceae are generally easy to distinguish from other plants, mainly because of their characteristic [[inflorescence]] and other shared characteristics.<ref name="Judd"/> However, determining genera and species is notoriously difficult (see "[[damned yellow composite]]" for example).

===Roots and stems===
Asteraceae generally produce [[taproot]]s, but sometimes they possess fibrous root systems. Stems are generally erect, but can be prostrate to ascending.  Some species have underground stems in the form of [[caudex|caudices]] or [[rhizome]]s. These can be fleshy or woody depending on the species.<ref name="Barkley et al."/>

===Leaves===
The [[leaf|leaves]] and the stems very often contain secretory canals with [[resin]] or [[latex]] (particularly common among the Cichorioideae). The leaves can be [[phyllotaxis|alternate]], [[phyllotaxis|opposite]], or [[phyllotaxis|whorled]]. They may be simple, but are often deeply [[leaf#Morphology|lobed]] or otherwise [[leaf#Morphology|incised]], often [[leaf#Morphology|conduplicate]] or [[leaf#Morphology|revolute]]. The margins can be entire or lobed or toothed.

===Flowers===
[[File:Carduus flowerdiagram.png|thumb|left|Flower diagram of ''[[Carduus]]'' (Carduoideae) shows (outermost to innermost): subtending bract and stem axis; fused calyx; fused corolla; stamens fused to corolla; gynoecium with two carpels and one locule]]

[[File:Ray-floret.svg|thumb|Ray floret (as in Cichorioideae, and the outer florets in Asteroideae)]]
[[File:Disc floret01.jpg|thumb|Disc floret (as in Asteroideae)]]
The most evident characteristic of Asteraceae is perhaps their [[inflorescence]]: a specialised ''[[Pseudanthium|capitulum]]'', technically called a ''calathid'' or ''calathidium'', but generally referred to as ''flower head'' or, alternatively, simply ''capitulum''.<ref>Usher, G. (1966) A dictionary of botany, including terms used in bio-chemistry, soil science, and statistics. LCCN 66 0 25447</ref> The ''capitulum'' is a contracted [[raceme]] composed of numerous individual [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] [[flower]]s, called the ''florets'', all sharing the same [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].

The capitulum of Asteraceae has evolved many characteristics that make it look superficially like a single flower. This type of flower-like inflorescence is fairly widespread amongst angiosperms, and has been given the name of ''[[pseudanthium|pseudanthia]]''.

A set of [[bract]]s forms an [[involucral bract|involucre]] surrounding the base of the capitulum. These are called "phyllaries", or "involucral bracts". They may simulate the [[sepal]]s of the pseudanthium. These are mostly herbaceous but can also be brightly coloured (e.g. ''[[Helichrysum]]'') or have a scarious (dry and membranous) texture. The phyllaries can be free or fused, and arranged in one to many rows, overlapping like the tiles of a roof (''imbricate'') or not (this variation is important in identification of tribes and genera).

Each floret may itself be subtended by a bract, called a "palea" or "receptacular bract". These bracts as a group are often called "[[chaff]]". The presence or absence of these bracts, their distribution on the receptacle, and their size and shape are all important diagnostic characteristics for genera and tribes.

The florets have five [[petal]]s fused at the base to form a [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] tube and they may be either [[actinomorphic]] or [[zygomorphic]]. ''Disc florets'' are usually actinomorphic, with five petal lips on the rim of the corolla tube. The petal lips may be either very short, or long, in which case they form deeply lobed petals. The latter is the only kind of floret in the Carduoideae, while the first kind is more widespread. ''Ray florets'' are always highly zygomorphic and are characterised by the presence of a ''ligule'', a strap-shaped structure on the edge of the corolla tube consisting of fused petals. In the Asteroideae and other minor subfamilies these are usually borne only on florets at the circumference of the capitulum and have a 3+2 scheme &ndash; above the fused corolla tube, three very long fused [[petal]]s form the ligule, with the other two petals being inconspicuously small. The Cichorioidea has only ray florets, with a 5+0 scheme &ndash; all five petals form the ligule. A 4+1 scheme is found in the Barnadesioideae. The tip of the ligule is often divided into teeth, each one representing a petal. Some marginal florets may have no petals at all (filiform floret).

The [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of the florets may be absent, but when present is always modified into a [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] of two or more teeth, scales or bristles and this is often involved in the dispersion of the seeds. As with the bracts, the nature of the pappus is an important diagnostic feature.

There are usually five [[stamen]]s. The filaments are fused to the corolla, while the anthers are generally [[connation|connate]] (''syngenesious'' anthers), thus forming a sort of tube around the style (''theca''). They commonly have basal and/or apical appendages. Pollen is released inside the tube and is collected around the growing style, and then, as the style elongates, is pushed out of the tube (''nüdelspritze'').

The [[pistil]] consists of two connate [[carpel]]s. The [[carpel|style]] has two lobes. Stigmatic tissue may be located in the interior surface or form two lateral lines. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior and has only one [[ovule]], with basal [[placentation]].

===Fruits and seeds===
The fruit of the Asteraceae is [[achene]]-like, and is called a '''cypsela''' (plural ''cypselae''). Although there are two fused [[carpel]]s, there is only one locule, and only one [[seed]] per fruit is formed. It may sometimes be winged or spiny because the '''pappus''', which is derived from [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] tissue often remains on the fruit (for example in [[dandelion]]). In some species, however, the pappus falls off (for example in ''[[Helianthus]]''). Cypsela [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] is often used to help determine plant relationships at the genus and species level.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | pages = 569–594 | url = http://apt.allenpress.com/aptonline/?request=get-abstract&issn=0026-6493&volume=092&issue=04&page=0569 | title = Morphology Of Cypselae In Subtribe Arctotidinae (Compositae–Arctotideae) And Its Taxonomic Implications | author = McKenzie, R.J., Samuel, J., Muller, E.M., Skinner, A.K.W., Barker, N.P. | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | year = 2005 }}</ref> The mature [[seed]]s usually have little [[endosperm]] or none.<ref name="Judd"/>

===Metabolites===
Asteraceae generally store energy in the form of [[inulin]].  They produce iso/[[chlorogenic acid]], [[sesquiterpene]] [[lactones]], pentacyclic triterpene alcohols, various [[alkaloid]]s, [[acetylene]]s (cyclic, aromatic, with vinyl end groups), [[tannin]]s. They have [[terpene|terpenoid]] [[essential oil]]s which never contain [[iridoid]]s.<ref name="Stevens"/>

==Evolution==
Diversification of Asteraceae appears to have taken place roughly 42-36 million years ago, the stem group perhaps being up to 49 million years old.<ref name="Stevens"/>

It is still unknown whether the precise cause of their great success was the development of the highly specialised capitulum, their ability to store energy as [[fructan]]s (mainly [[inulin]]), which is an advantage in relatively dry zones, or some combination of these and possibly other factors.<ref name="Stevens"/>

==Ecology==
[[File:Kih-silberdistel.jpg|thumb|left|Seeds are dispersed by the wind in ''[[Carlina]]'']]
[[File:Epizoochoria NRM.jpg|thumb|left|Epizoochory in ''[[Bidens tripartita]]'']]
Asteraceae are especially common in open and dry environments.<ref name="Judd"/>

Many members of the Asteraceae are [[pollination|pollinated]] by insects, which explains their value in attracting [[beneficial insects]], but [[pollination syndrome|anemophyly]] is also present (e.g. ''[[Ragweed|Ambrosia]]'', ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'').  There are many [[apomixis|apomictic]] species in the family.

Seeds are ordinarily dispersed intact with the fruiting body, the cypsela.  Wind dispersal is common (''[[Seed dispersal#Wind|anemochory]]'') assisted by a hairy pappus. Another common variation is ''[[Seed dispersal#Dispersal by animals|epizoochory]]'', in which the dispersal unit, a single cypsela (e.g. ''[[Bidens]]'') or entire capitulum (e.g. ''[[Arctium]]'') provided with hooks, spines or some equivalent structure, sticks to the fur or plumage of an animal (or even to clothes, like in the photo) just to fall off later far from its mother plant.

==Uses==
Commercially important plants in the Asteraceae include the food crops ''[[Lactuca sativa]]'' (lettuce), ''[[Cichorium]]'' (chicory), ''[[Cynara scolymus]]'' (globe artichoke), ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'' ([[sunflower]]), ''[[Smallanthus sonchifolius]]'' (yacón), ''[[Carthamus tinctorius]]'' (safflower) and ''[[Helianthus tuberosus]]'' (Jerusalem artichoke).

Many members of the family are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers and some are important ornamental crops for the cut flower industry. Some examples are ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'', ''[[Gerbera]]'', ''[[Calendula]]'', ''[[Dendranthema]]'', ''[[Argyranthemum]]'', ''[[Dahlia]]'', ''[[Tagetes]]'', ''[[Zinnia]]'' and many others.

Other commercially important species include Compositae used as herbs and in [[tisane|herbal tea]]s and other beverages.  Chamomile, which comes from two different species, the annual ''[[Matricaria recutita]]'' or German chamomile, and the perennial ''[[Chamaemelum nobile]]'', also called Roman chamomile.  ''[[Calendula]]'', also called the pot marigold is grown commercially for herbal teas and the potpourri industry.  Echinacea (''[[Echinacea purpurea]]''), is used as a medicinal tea.  Winter tarragon, also called Mexican mint marigold, ''[[Tagetes lucida]]'' is commonly grown and used as a tarragon substitute in climates where tarragon will not survive.  Finally, the wormwood genus ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'' includes [[absinthe]] (''A. absinthium'') and [[tarragon]] (''A. dracunculus'').

Compositae have also been used for industrial purposes.  Common in all commercial poultry feed, marigold (''[[Tagetes patula]]'') is grown primarily in Mexico and Central American nations. Marigold oil, extracted from ''[[Tagetes minuta]]'', is used in the cola and cigarette industries.

Plants in Asteraceae are medically important in areas that don't have access to Western medicine. They are also commonly featured in medical and phytochemical journals because the [[sesquiterpene]] [[lactone]] compounds contained within them are an important cause of [[allergic contact dermatitis]]. Allergy to these compounds is the leading cause of allergic contact dermatitis in florists in the US.<ref>{{cite book | title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology| authors = Odom, R.B., James, W.D., Berger, T.G. | year=2000| pages=1135 pages| publisher=W.B. Saunders Company| isbn=0-7216-5832-6}}</ref> [[Pollen]] from ragweed ''[[Ambrosia]]'' is among the main causes of so-called [[hay fever]] in the United States.<ref>Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. ''Ragweed Allergy''. http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&sub=19&cont=267</ref>

Many members of Asteraceae are copious [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] producers and are useful for evaluating [[pollinator]] populations during their bloom. ''[[Centaurea]]'' (knapweed), ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'' (domestic [[sunflower]]), and some species of ''[[Solidago]]'' (goldenrod) are major "[[honey]] plants" for [[beekeeper]]s. ''Solidago'' produces relatively high protein [[pollen]], which helps [[honey bee]]s over winter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Some members of the Asteraceae are economically important as weeds.  Notable in the United States are the ragwort,  ''[[Senecio jacobaea]]'', groundsel ''[[Senecio vulgaris]]'' and ''[[Taraxacum]]'' (dandelion).

The genera ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'', ''[[Pulicaria]]'', ''[[Tagetes]]'', and ''[[Tanacetum]]'' contain species with useful insecticidal properties.

''[[Parthenium argentatum]]'' (guayule) is a source of [[hypoallergenic]] [[latex]].

The essential oil is an ingredient in a "natural" haemorrhoid treatment.<ref>http://www.amoils.com/h-hemorrhoids-ingredients.html, http://www.amoils.com/hemorrhoids.html</ref>
