'''Cell biology''' (formerly '''cytology''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kytos'', "contain") is a [[list of academic disciplines|scientific discipline]] that studies [[cell (biology)|cells]] â€“ their [[physiology|physiological]] properties, their structure, the [[organelles]] they contain, interactions with their environment, their [[cell cycle|life cycle]], [[cell division|division]] and [[apoptosis|death]]. This is done both on a [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] level. [[Cell (biology)|Cell]] biology research encompasses both the great diversity of single-celled organisms like [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]], as well as the many specialized cells in multicellular [[organisms]] such as [[human]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[sponge]]s.

Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all [[biology|biological sciences]]. Appreciating the similarities and differences between cell types is particularly important to the fields of cell and [[molecular biology]] as well as to biomedical fields such as [[cancer research]] and [[developmental biology]]. These fundamental similarities and differences provide a unifying theme, sometimes allowing the [[Values|principles]] learned from studying one cell type to be extrapolated and generalized to other cell types. Therefore, research in cell biology is closely related to [[genetics]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[immunology]], and [[developmental biology]].

==Processes==

===Movement of proteins===

Each type of [[protein]] is usually sent to a particular part of the cell. An important part of cell biology is the investigation of molecular mechanisms by which proteins are moved to different places inside cells or secreted from cells.

Most [[protein]]s are synthesized by [[ribosome]]s in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] (rER). Ribosomes contain the nucleic acid RNA, which assembles and joins amino acids to make proteins. They can be found alone or in groups within the cytoplasm as well as on the rER.   This process is known as [[protein biosynthesis]]. Biosynthesis (also called biogenesis) is an enzyme-catalyzed process in cells of living organisms by which substrates are converted to more complex products (also simply known as [[translation (genetics)|protein translation]]). Some proteins, such as those to be incorporated in membranes (known as [[membrane protein]]s), are transported into the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) during synthesis. This process can be followed by transportation and processing in the [[Golgi apparatus]]. The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that processes proteins and prepares them for use both inside and outside the cell. The Golgi apparatus is somewhat like a post office. It receives items (proteins from the ER), packages and labels them, and then sends them on to their destinations (to different parts of the cell or to the cell membrane for transport out of the cell).<ref>[http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/8485 Open Content Flexbook- Cellular Structure & functions(for ribosomes and Golgi body info)]</ref> From the Golgi, membrane proteins can move to the [[plasma membrane]], to other sub-cellular compartments, or they can be secreted from the cell. The ER and Golgi can be thought of as the "membrane protein synthesis compartment" and the "membrane protein processing compartment", respectively. There is a semi-constant flux of proteins through these compartments. ER and Golgi-resident proteins associate with other proteins but remain in their respective compartments. Other proteins "flow" through the ER and Golgi to the plasma membrane. [[Kinesin|Motor proteins]] transport membrane protein-containing vesicles along [[cytoskeleton|cytoskeletal]] tracks to distant parts of cells such as [[axon]] terminals.

Some proteins that are made in the cytoplasm contain [[Nuclear Localization Signal|structural features]] that target them for transport into [[mitochondria]] or the [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]]. Some mitochondrial proteins are made inside mitochondria and are coded for by mitochondrial DNA. In plants, [[chloroplast]]s also make some cell proteins.

Extracellular and cell surface proteins destined to be degraded can move back into intracellular compartments upon being incorporated into [[Clathrin|endocytosed]] vesicles some of which fuse with [[lysosome]]s where the proteins are broken down to their individual [[amino acid]]s. The degradation of some membrane proteins begins while still at the cell surface when they are separated by [[secretase]]s. Proteins that function in the cytoplasm are often degraded by [[proteasome]]s.

===Other cellular processes===
*[[Active transport]] and [[Passive transport]] - Movement of molecules into and out of cells.
*[[Autophagy]] - The process whereby cells "eat" their own internal components or microbial invaders.
*[[Cell adhesion|Adhesion]] - Holding together cells and tissues.
*Reproduction - Made possible by the combination of sperm made in the testiculi (contained in some male cells' nuclei) and the egg made in the ovary (contained in the nucleus of a female cell). When the sperm breaks through the hard outer shell of the egg a new cell embryo is formed, which, in humans, grows to full size in 9 months.

==Techniques used to study cells==
[[Image:Drosophila m oogenesis.png|thumb|right|300px]]
'''Cells may be observed under the microscope'''. This includes the [[Optical Microscope]], [[Transmission Electron Microscope]], [[Scanning Electron Microscope]], [[Fluorescence Microscope]], and by [[Confocal Microscopy]].

Several different techniques exist to study cells are

*[[Cell culture]] is the basic technique of growing cells in a laboratory independent of an organism.
*[[Immunostaining]], also known as [[immunohistochemistry]], is a specialized histological method used to localize proteins in cells or tissue slices. Unlike regular histology, which uses stains to identify cells, cellular components or protein classes, immunostaining requires the reaction of an antibody directed against the protein of interest within the tissue or cell. Through the use of proper controls and published protocols (need to add reference links here), specificity of the antibody-antigen reaction can be achieved. Once this complex is formed, it is identified via either a "tag" attached directly to the antibody, or added in an additional technical step. Commonly used "tags" include fluorophores or enzymes. In the case of the former, detection of the location of the "immuno-stained" protein occurs via [[fluorescence microscopy]]. With an enzymatic tag, such as horse radish peroxidase, a chemical reaction is carried out that results in a dark color in the location of the protein of interest. This darkened pattern is then detected using [[light microscopy]].
*[[Computational genomics]] is used to find patterns in genomic information <ref>Cristianini, N. and Hahn, M. [http://www.computational-genomics.net/ ''Introduction to Computational Genomics''], [[Cambridge University Press]], 2006. (ISBN 9780521671910 | ISBN 0-521-67191-4)</ref>
*[[DNA microarray]]s identify changes in transcript levels between different experimental conditions.
*[[Gene knockdown]] mutates a selected gene.
*[[In situ hybridization]] shows which cells are expressing a particular RNA transcript.
*[[PCR]] can be used to determine how many copies of a gene are present in a cell.
*[[Transfection]] introduces a new gene into a cell, usually an expression construct

'''Purification of cells and their parts'''
Purification may be performed using the following methods:
*[[Cell fractionation]]
**Release of cellular organelles by disruption of cells.
**Separation of different organelles by [[centrifugation]].
*[[Flow cytometry]]
*[[Immunoprecipitation]]
*Proteins extracted from [[cell membrane]]s by [[detergent]]s and [[salt]]s or other kinds of chemicals.
