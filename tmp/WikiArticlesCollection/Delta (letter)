{{Greek Alphabet|letter=delta}}
'''Delta''' (uppercase '''Δ''', lowercase '''δ'''; {{lang|el|Δέλτα}} ''Délta''; Modern Greek {{IPA-el|ˈðelta|}}) is the fourth letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. In the system of [[Greek numerals]] it has a value of 4. It was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letter]] [[Dalet (letter)|dalet]] [[Image:phoenician daleth.png|20px]]. Letters that come from delta include [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] [[D]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[De (Cyrillic)|Д]].

A [[river delta]] (originally, the [[Nile River]] delta) is so named because its shape approximates the upper-case letter delta (the shape is a triangle). {{cn|date=October 2013}}

==Pronunciation and origin==
In [[Ancient Greek]], it represented a [[voiced dental plosive]] {{IPA|/d/}}. In [[Modern Greek]], it represents a [[voiced dental fricative]] {{IPA|/ð/}}, like the "th" in "that" or "this". It is [[romanization of Greek|romanized]] as ''d'' or ''dh''.<br>
The capital letter delta ('''Δ''', which has the convenient form of an [[isosceles triangle]]) is commonly used in subjects of science and mathematics, often to describe change, because delta is the initial letter of the Greek word διαφορά, ''diaphorá'', "difference" (the small [[Latin]] letter '''d''' is used in much the same way for the notation of [[derivative]]s and [[differential (mathematics)|differential]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=September 2013}}, which also describe change).

==Upper case==
The upper-case letter Δ can be used to denote
*[[Change (mathematics)|Change]] of any changeable quantity, in mathematics and the sciences (More specifically, the [[difference operator]]{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}); for example, in
::<math>{y_2-y_1\over x_2-x_1} = {\Delta y \over \Delta x}</math>, the average change of y per unit x, i.e. the change of y over the change of x
*The [[Laplace operator]]:
:<math>\Delta f = \sum_{i=1}^n {\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i^2}}</math>
*The [[discriminant]] of a [[polynomial]] equation, especially the [[quadratic equation]]:
:<math>\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\,\!</math>
*A [[derivative|macroscopic change]] in the value of a variable in mathematics or science

*In [[genetics]], it can stand for a [[Deletion (genetics)|gene deletion]], e.g. the [[CCR5-Δ32]] a deletion of the CCR5 at the 32nd base pair segment
*The [http://ada.org/ American Dental Association] cites it (together with omicron for "odont") as the symbol of dentistry.<ref>[http://www.ada.org/2517.aspx?currentTab=2 Caduceus, the emblem of dentistry - American Dental Association - ADA.org]</ref>
