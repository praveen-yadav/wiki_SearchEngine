'''Relations between Canada and the United States''' have spanned more than two centuries. This includes a shared [[British colonization of the Americas|British cultural heritage]], warfare during the 1770s and 1812, and the eventual development of one of the most stable and mutually-beneficial international relationships in the modern world. Each is the other's chief economic partner and tourism and migration between the two nations has increased rapport. The most serious breach in the relationship was the [[War of 1812]], which saw the United States attempt a failed invasion.The border remained the same after the war and was demilitarized. Apart from minor raids, it has remained peaceful. Military collaboration began during [[World War II]] and continued throughout the [[Cold War]] on both a bilateral basis through [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] and through multilateral participation in [[NATO]]. A high volume of trade and migration between the United States and Canada has generated closer ties, especially after the signing of the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] in 1988.

Canada and the United States are currently the world's largest trading partners,<ref>See [http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/top/dst/current/balance.html 2009 data]</ref> share [[Canada–United States border|the world's longest border]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/long263.html|title=The world's longest border|accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> and have significant interoperability within the defence sphere. Recent difficulties have included repeated trade disputes, environmental concerns, Canadian concern for the future of [[petroleum|oil]] exports, and issues of illegal immigration and the threat of [[terrorism]].  Nevertheless, trade between the two countries has continued to expand in both absolute and relative terms for the last two hundred years, but especially following the 1988 FTA and the subsequent signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in 1994 which has since further merged the two economies.

The foreign policies of the neighbours have been closely aligned since the [[Cold War]]. However, Canada has disagreed with American policies regarding the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cuba–United States relations|status of Cuba]], the [[Iraq War]], [[National Missile Defense in Canada|Missile Defense]], and the [[War on Terrorism]]. A serious [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] debate is whether the [[Northwest Passage]] is in [[international waters]] or under Canadian jurisdiction.

There are close cultural ties between modern day Canada and the United States, advanced by such similarities as the language as both predominantly speak English.

Meanwhile co-operation on many fronts, such as the ease of the flow of goods, services, and people across borders are to be even more extended, as well as the establishment of joint border inspection agencies, relocation of U.S. food inspectors agents to Canadian plants and ''vice versa'', greater sharing of intelligence, and harmonizing regulations on everything from food to manufactured goods, thus further increasing the American-Canadian assemblage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20110203/harper-obama-border-summit-faces-sovereignty-delays-110203/ |title=Harper, Obama to push for major border deal - CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>

According to [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'s annual public opinion polls, Canada has consistently been Americans' favorite nation, with 96% of Americans viewing Canada favorably in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/126116/Canada-Places-First-Image-Contest-Iran-Last.aspx |title=In U.S., Canada Places First in Image Contest; Iran Last |publisher=Gallup.com |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2011-02-26}} published in 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.gallup.com/poll/152735/americans-give-record-high-ratings-several-allies.aspx Americans Give Record-High Ratings to Several U.S. Allies] ''[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]''</ref> According to a 2013 [[BBC]] World Service Poll, 84% of Americans view their northern neighbor positively, with only 5% expressing a negative view, the most favorable perception of Canada in the world. However, Canadian views of the U.S. are much more sharply divided, with 45% viewing the U.S. positively and 45% viewing the U.S. negatively.<ref>[http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2013_country_ratings/2013_country_rating_poll_bbc_globescan.pdf 2013 World Service Poll] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>

==History==

===Colonial wars===
Before the British conquest of French Canada in 1760, there had been a series of wars between the British and the French which were fought out in the colonies as well as in Europe and the high seas.  In general, the British heavily relied on American colonial militia units, while the French heavily relied on their Indian allies. The Iroquois Indians were important allies of the British.<ref>William Thomas Morgan, "The Five Nations and Queen Anne,"''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1926) 13#2 pp. 169-189 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1891955 in JSTOR]</ref>  Much of the fighting involved ambushes and small-scale warfare in the villages along the border between New England and Quebec. The New England colonies had a much larger population than Quebec, so major invasions came from south to north. The Indian allies, only loosely controlled by the French, repeatedly raided New England villages to kidnap women and children, and torture and kill the men.<ref>June Namias, ''White Captives: Gender and Ethnicity on the American Frontier'' (1993)</ref>  Those who survived were brought up as Francophone Catholics. The tension along the border was exacerbated by religion, the French Catholics and English Protestants had a deep mutual distrust.<ref>Howard H. Peckham, ''The Colonial Wars'' (1965)</ref> There was a naval dimension as well, involving privateers attacking enemy merchant ships.<ref>Donald F. Chard, "The Impact of French Privateering on New England, 1689-1713," ''American Neptune'' (1975) 35#3 pp 153-165</ref>

England seized Quebec from 1629 to 1632, and Acadia in 1613 and again from 1654 to 1670; These territories were returned to France by the peace treaties.  The major wars were (to use American names), [[King William's War]] (1689-1697); [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702-1713); [[King George's War]] (1744-1748), and the [[French and Indian War]] (1755-1763).

New England soldiers and sailors were critical to the successful British campaign to capture the French fortress of Louisbourg  in 1745,<ref>S. E. D.  Shortt, "Conflict and Identity in Massachusetts: The Louisbourg Expedition of 1745," ''Social History / Histoire Sociale'' (1972) 5#10 pp 165-185.</ref>  and (after it had been returned by treaty) to capture it again in 1758.<ref>A. J. B. Johnston, "D-Day at Louisbourg," ''Beaver'' (2008) 88#3 pp 16-23</ref>

===Mingling of peoples===
From the 1750s to the 21st century, there has been extensive mingling of the Canadian and American populations, with large movements in both directions.<ref>Marcus Lee Hansen, ''The Mingling of the Canadian and American Peoples. Vol. 1: Historical'' (1940)</ref>

New England [[Yankee]]s settled large parts of [[Nova Scotia]] before 1775, and were neutral during the [[American Revolution]].<ref>John Brebner, ''The Neutral Yankees of Nova Scotia: A Marginal Colony During the Revolutionary Years'' (1937)</ref> At the end of the Revolution, about 75,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] moved out of the new United States to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the lands of Quebec, east and south of Montreal. From 1790 to 1812 many farmers moved from New York and New England into Ontario (mostly to Niagara, and the north shore of Lake Ontario). In the mid and late 19th century gold rushes attracted American prospectors, mostly to British Columbia (Cariboo, Fraser gold rushes) and later to the Yukon. In the early 20th century, the opening of land blocks in the Prairie Provinces attracted many farmers from the American Midwest. Many Mennonites immigrated from Pennsylvania and formed their own colonies. In the 1890s some Mormons went north to form communities in Alberta after the [[LDS Church]] rejected plural marriage.<ref>Marcus Lee Hansen, ''The Mingling of the Canadian and American Peoples. Vol. 1: Historical'' (1940); David D. Harvey, ''Americans in Canada: Migration and Settlement since 1840'' (1991)</ref> The 1960s saw the arrival of about 50,000 draft-dodgers who opposed the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Renee Kasinsky, "Refugees from Militarism: Draft Age Americans in Canada'' (1976)</ref>

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, about 900,000 French Canadians moved to the U.S., with 395,000 residents there in 1900. Two-thirds went to mill towns in New England, where they formed distinctive ethnic communities. By the late 20th century, they had abandoned the French language, but most kept the Catholic religion.<ref>Yves Roby, ''The Franco-Americans of New England'' (2004); Elliott Robert Barkan, "French Canadians" in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) pp 389–401</ref> About twice as many English Canadians came to the U.S., but they did not form distinctive ethnic settlements.<ref>Alan A. Brookes, "Canadians, British" in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) pp 191ff.</ref>

Canada was a way-station through which immigrants from other lands stopped for a while, ultimately heading to the U.S. In 1851–1951, 7.1 million people arrived in Canada (mostly from Continental Europe), and 6.6 million left Canada, most of them to the U.S.<ref>Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) p 392.</ref>

===American Revolution===
At the outset of the [[American Revolution]], the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American revolutionaries]] hoped the [[French Canadians]] in Quebec and the Colonists in [[Nova Scotia]] would join their rebellion and they were pre-approved for joining the United States in the [[Articles of Confederation]]. When [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Canada was invaded]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], thousands joined the American cause and formed regiments that fought during the war; however most remained neutral and some joined the British effort. Britain advised the French Canadians that the British Empire already enshrined their rights in the [[Quebec Act]], which the American colonies had viewed as one of the [[Intolerable Acts]]. The American invasion was a fiasco and Britain tightened its grip on its northern possessions; in 1777, a major British invasion into New York led to the surrender of the entire British army at Saratoga, and led France to enter the war as an ally of the U.S. The French Canadians largely ignored France's appeals for solidarity.<ref>Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians, 1760-1945'' (1955) p. 74.</ref> After the war Canada became a refuge for about 75,000 [[United Empire Loyalists|Loyalists]] who either wanted to leave the U.S., or were compelled by Patriot reprisals to do so.<ref>Thomas B. Allen, ''Tories: Fighting for the King in America's First Civil War'' (2010) p xviii</ref>
Among the original Loyalists there were 3500 free blacks. Most went to Nova Scotia and in 1792, 1200 migrated to [[Sierra Leone]]. About 2000 black slaves were brought in by Loyalist owners; they remained slaves in Canada until the Empire abolished slavery in 1833. Before 1860, about 30,000-40,000 blacks entered Canada; many were already free and others were escaped slaves who came through the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>Patrick Bode, "Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves," ''Beaver'' 1993 73(3): 17-19; Paul Robert Magocsi, ed. ''Enyclopedia of Canada's Peoples'' (1999) p 142-3</ref>

===War of 1812===
{{main|War of 1812}}
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the war, called for British forces to vacate all their forts south of the [[Great Lakes]] border. Britain refused to do so, citing failure of the United States to provide financial restitution for Loyalists who had lost property in the war. The [[Jay Treaty]] in 1795 with Great Britain resolved that lingering issue and the British departed the forts. [[Thomas Jefferson]] saw the nearby British imperial presence as a threat to the [[United States]], and so he opposed the [[Jay Treaty]], and it became one of the major political issues in the United States at the time.<ref>Bradford Perkins, ''The First Rapprochement: England and the United States, 1795–1805'' (1955)</ref> Thousands of Americans immigrated to Upper Canada (Ontario) from 1785 to 1812 to obtain cheaper land and better tax rates prevalent in that province; despite expectations that they would be loyal to the U.S. if a war broke out, in the event they were largely non-political.<ref>{{cite book|author=George A. Rawlyk|title=The Canada Fire: Radical Evangelicalism in British North America, 1775-1812|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ShZFFfyW1wMC&pg=PA122|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=122}}</ref>

Tensions mounted again after 1805, erupting into the [[War of 1812]], when the Americans declared war on Britain. The Americans were angered by British harassment of U.S. ships on the high seas and seizure ("[[Impressment]]") of 6,000 sailors from American ships, severe restrictions against neutral American trade with France, and British support for hostile Indian tribes in Ohio and territories the U.S. had gained in 1783. American "honor" was an implicit issue. The Americans were outgunned by more than 10 to 1 by the [[Royal Navy]], but could call on an army much larger than the British garrison in Canada, and so a land invasion of Canada was proposed as the only feasible, and most advantegous means of attacking the British Empire. Americans on the western frontier also hoped an invasion would bring an end to British support of [[American Indians in the United States|Native American]] resistance to the [[westward expansion of the United States]], typified by [[Tecumseh]]'s coalition of tribes.<ref>Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, & Indian Allies'' (2010).</ref> Americans may also have wanted to annex Canada {{sfn|Stagg|2012|pp=5-6}}<ref>George F.

Once war broke out, the American strategy was to seize Canada - perhaps as a means of forcing concessions from the British Empire, or perhaps in order to annex it. There was some hope that settlers in western Canada—most of them recent immigrants from the U.S.—would welcome the chance to overthrow their British rulers. However, the American invasions were defeated primarily by British regulars with support from Native Americans and [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario) militia. Aided by the powerful Royal Navy, a series of British raids on the American coast were highly successful, culminating with an [[Burning of Washington|attack on Washington]] that resulted in the British burning of the [[White House]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], and other public buildings.  Major British invasions of New York in 1814 and Louisiana in 1814–15 were fiascoes, with the British retreating from New York and decisively defeated at the [[Battle of New Orleans]]. At the end of the war, Britain's American Indian allies had largely been defeated, and the American's controlled a strip of Western Ontario centered on [[Amherstburg|Fort Malden]]. However, Britain held much of Maine, and, with the support of their remaining American Indian allies, huge areas of the Old Northwest, including [[Wisconsin]] and much of [[Michigan]] and [[Illinois]].  With the surrender of Napoleon in 1814, Britain ended naval policies that angered Americans; with the defeat of the Indian tribes the threat to American expansion was ended. The upshot was both sides had asserted their honour, Canada was not annexed, and London and Washington had nothing more to fight over. The war was ended by the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which took effect in February 1815.<ref>Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2007) is a Canadian perspective.</ref> A series of postwar agreements further stabilized peaceful relations along the Canadian-US border. Canada reduced American immigration for fear of undue American influence, and built up the Anglican church as a counterweight to the largely American Methodist and Baptist churches.<ref>W.L. Morton, ''The Kingdom of Canada'' (1969) ch 12</ref>

In later years, Anglophone Canadians, especially in Ontario, viewed the War of 1812 as a heroic and successful resistance against invasion and as a victory that defined them as a people. The myth that the Canadian militia had defeated the invasion almost single-handed, known logically as the "militia myth", became highly prevalent after the war, having been propounded by [[John Strachan]], [[Toronto|Anglican Bishop of York]]. Meanwhile the United States celebrated victory in its "Second War of Independence," and war heroes such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] headed to the White House.<ref>A.J. Langguth, ''Union 1812: The Americans Who Fought the Second War of Independence'' (2006) ch 24</ref>

===Conservative reaction===
In the aftermath of the War of 1812, pro-imperial conservatives led by Anglican Bishop [[John Strachan]] took control in Ontario ("Upper Canada"), and promoted the Anglican religion as opposed to the more republican Methodist and Baptist churches. A small interlocking elite, known as the [[Family Compact]] took full political control. Democracy, as practiced in the US, was ridiculed. The policies had the desired effect of deterring immigration from United States.  [[Rebellions of 1837|Revolts in favor of democracy]] in Ontario and Quebec ("Lower Canada") in 1837 were suppressed; many of the leaders fled to the US.<ref>Tom Dunning, "The Canadian Rebellions of 1837 and 1838 as a Borderland War: A Retrospective," ''Ontario History'' (2009) 101#2 pp 129-141.</ref>  The American policy was to largely ignore the rebellions,<ref>Orrin Edward Tiffany,  ''The Relations of the United States to the Canadian Rebellion of 1837–1838'' (1905). [http://www.amazon.com/Relations-United-Canadian-Rebellion-1837-1838/dp/1236388712/ excerpt and text search]</ref> and indeed ignore Canada generally in favor of westward expansion of the [[American Frontier]].

===Alabama claims===
[[Image:CanadianAmericaRelationsCartoon1886.gif|thumb|An editorial cartoon on Canada – United States relations, 1886. It reads: Mrs. Britannia.—“Is it possible, my dear, that you have ever given your cousin Jonathan any encouragement?” Miss Canada.—“Encouragement! Certainly not, Mamma. I have told him that we can never be united.”]]
At the end of the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, Americans were angry at British support for the Confederacy. One result was toleration of [[Fenian raids|Fenian efforts to use the U.S. as a base to attack Canada.]] More serious was the demand for a huge payment to cover the damages caused, on the notion that British involvement had lengthened the war. Senator [[Charles Sumner]], the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, originally wanted to ask for $2 billion, or alternatively the ceding of all of Canada to the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jay Sexton|title=Debtor Diplomacy: Finance and American Foreign Relations in the Civil War Era, 1837-1873|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TuepT3C0TCsC&pg=PA206|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=206}}</ref> When American Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] with Russia in 1867, he intended it as the first step in a comprehensive plan to gain control of the entire northwest Pacific Coast. Seward was a firm believer in [[Manifest Destiny]], primarily for its commercial advantages to the U.S. Seward expected [[British Columbia]] to seek annexation to the U.S. and thought Britain might accept this in exchange for the ''Alabama'' claims. Soon other elements endorsed annexation, Their plan was to annex [[British Columbia]], [[Red River Colony]] (Manitoba), and [[Nova Scotia]], in exchange for the dropping the damage claims. The idea reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1870, with American expansionists, Canadian separatists, and British anti-imperialists seemingly combining forces. The plan was dropped for multiple reasons. London continued to stall, American commercial and financial groups pressed Washington for a quick settlement of the dispute on a cash basis, growing Canadian nationalist sentiment in British Columbia called for staying inside the British Empire, Congress became preoccupied with Reconstruction, and most Americans showed little interest in territorial expansion. The "[[Alabama Claims]]" dispute went to international arbitration. In one of the first major cases of arbitration, the tribunal in 1872 supported the American claims and ordered Britain to pay $15.5 million. Britain paid and the episode ended in peaceful relations.<ref>Doris W. Dashew, "The Story of An Illusion: The Plan To Trade 'Alabama' Claims For Canada," ''Civil War History,'' December 1969, Vol. 15 Issue 4, pp 332-348</ref><ref>David E.  Shi, "Seward's Attempt to Annex British Columbia, 1865-1869," ''Pacific Historical Review,'' (1978) 47#2 pp 217-238 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3637972 in JSTOR]</ref>

===Dominion of Canada===
Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867 in internal affairs while Britain controlled diplomacy and defense policy. Prior to Confederation, there was an [[Oregon boundary dispute]] in which the Americans claimed the 54th degree latitude. That issue was resolved by splitting the disputed territory; the northern half became British Columbia, and the southern half the states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. Strained relations with America continued, however, due to a series of small-scale armed incursions named the [[Fenian raids]] by [[Irish American|Irish-American]] Civil War veterans across the border from 1866 to 1871 in an attempt to trade Canada for Irish independence.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yossi Shain|title=Marketing the American Creed Abroad: Diasporas in the U.S. and Their Homelands|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8pqj8GFCg7MC&pg=PA53|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=53}}</ref> The American government, angry at Canadian tolerance of Confederate raiders during the American Civil War, moved very slowly to disarm the [[Fenians]]. The British government, in charge of diplomatic relations, protested cautiously, as Anglo-American relations were tense. Much of the tension was relieved as the Fenians faded away and in 1872 by the settlement of the [[Alabama Claims]], when Britain paid the U.S. $15.5 million for war losses caused by warships built in Britain and sold to the Confederacy.

Disputes over ocean boundaries on [[Georges Bank]] and over fishing, whaling, and sealing rights in the Pacific were settled by international arbitration, setting an important precedent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Kurlansky|title=Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UKv3CIH2rvoC&pg=PT117|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|page=117}}</ref>

===Emigration to and from the United States===
{{Further|French American}}
After 1850, the pace of industrialization and urbanization was much faster in the United States, drawing a wide range of immigrants from the North.  By 1870, 1/6 of all the people born in Canada had moved to the United States, with the highest concentrations in New England, which was the destination of emigrants from Quebec and the Maritimes; people from Ontario moved into nearby Michigan.  It was common for people to move back and forth across the border, such as seasonal lumberjacks, entrepreneurs looking for larger markets, and families looking for jobs in the textile mills that paid much higher wages than in Quebec.<ref>John J. Bukowczyk et al. ''Permeable Border: The Great Lakes Region as Transnational Region, 1650-1990'' (University of Pittsburgh Press. 2005)</ref>

The southward migration slacked off after 1890, as Canadian industry began a growth spurt.  By then, the American frontier was closing, and hundreds of thousands of farmers looking for fresh land moved from the United States north into the Prairie Provinces. The net result of the flows were that in 1901 there were 128,000 American-born residents in Canada (3.5% of the Canadian population) and 1.18 million Canadian-born residents in the United States (1.6% of the U.S. population).<ref>J. Castell Hopkins, ''The Canadian Annual Review of Public Affairs: 1902'' (1903), p. 327.</ref>

===Alaska boundary===
A long-standing controversy was the [[Alaska boundary dispute]], settled in favor of the United States in 1903. At issue was the exact boundary between Alaska and Canada, specifically whether Canada would have a port near the present American town of [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]] that would give an all-Canadian route to the rich new Yukon goldfields. The dispute was settled by arbitration, and the British delegate voted with the Americans—to the astonishment and disgust of Canadians who suddenly realized that Britain considered its relations with the United States paramount compared to those with Canada.<ref>John A. Munro, "English-Canadianism and the Demand for Canadian Autonomy: Ontario's Response to the Alaska Boundary Decision, 1903." ''Ontario History'' (1965) 57#4 pp 189-203</ref>

1907 saw a minor controversy over [[USS Nashville (PG-7)|USS ''Nashville'']] sailing into the Great Lakes via Canada without Canadian permission. To head off future embarrassments, in 1909 the two sides signed the [[International Boundary Waters Treaty]] and the [[International Joint Commission]] was established to manage the Great Lakes.

===Reciprocal trade with U.S.===
[[Image:Reciprocity pigs.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1911 Conservative campaign poster warns that the big American companies ("trusts") will hog all the benefits of reciprocity as proposed by Liberals, leaving little left over for Canadian interests.]]
Anti-Americanism reached a shrill peak in 1911 in Canada.<ref>W. M. Baker, "A Case Study of Anti-Americanism in English-Speaking Canada: The Election Campaign of 1911," ''Canadian Historical Review,'' (1970) 51#4 pp 426-449</ref> The Liberal government in 1911 negotiated a [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|Reciprocity]] treaty with the U.S. that would lower trade barriers. Canadian manufacturing interests were alarmed that free trade allow the bigger and more efficient American factories to take their markets.   The Conservatives made it a central campaign issue in the [[Canadian federal election, 1911|1911 election]], warning that it would be a "sell out" to the United States with economic annexation a special danger.<ref>Kendrick A. Clements, "Manifest Destiny and Canadian Reciprocity in 1911," ''Pacific Historical Review'' (1973) 42#1 pp. 32-52 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3637741 in JSTOR]</ref> Conservative slogan was "No truck or trade with the Yankees", as they appealed to Canadian nationalism and nostalgia for the British Empire to win a major victory.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis E. Ellis|title=Reciprocity, 1911: a study in Canadian-American relations|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Fz8fAAAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Greenwood }}</ref>

===Canadian autonomy===
Canada demanded and received permission from London to send its own delegation to the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Talks]] in 1919, with the proviso that it sign the treaty under the British Empire. Canada subsequently took responsibility for its own foreign and military affairs in the 1920s. Its first ambassador to the United States, [[Vincent Massey]], was named in 1927. The United States first ambassador to Canada was [[William Phillips (diplomat)|William Phillips]]. Canada became an active member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], the [[League of Nations]], and the [[Permanent Court of International Justice|World Court]], none of which included the U.S.

Relations with the United States were cordial until 1930, when Canada vehemently protested the new [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] by which the U.S. raised tariffs (taxes) on products imported from Canada. Canada retaliated with higher tariffs of its own against American products, and moved toward more trade within the British Commonwealth. U.S.-Canadian trade fell 75% as the [[Great Depression]] dragged both countries down.<ref>Richard N. Kottman, "Herbert Hoover and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff: Canada, A Case Study," ''Journal of American History'', Vol. 62, No. 3 (December , 1975), pp. 609-635 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2936217 in JSTOR]

Down to the 1920s the war and naval departments of both nations designed hypothetical war game scenarios with the other as an enemy.  These were primarily exercises; the departments were never told to get ready for a real war. In 1921, Canada developed [[Defence Scheme No. 1]] for an attack on American cities and for forestalling invasion by the United States until [[British Empire|Imperial]] reinforcements arrived. Through the later 1920s and 1930s, the [[United States Army War College]] developed a plan for a war with the [[British Empire]] waged largely on North American territory, in [[War Plan Red]] (interestingly, American war planners had no thoughts of returning captured British territory.)<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/29/AR2005122901412_2.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Peter | last=Carlson | title=Raiding the Icebox | date=2005-12-30}}</ref>

[[Herbert Hoover]] meeting in 1927 with British Ambassador  Sir Esme Howard agreed on the "absurdity of contemplating the possibility of war between the United States and the British Empire."<ref>Christopher M. Bell, "Thinking the Unthinkable: British and American Naval Strategies for an Anglo-American War, 1918–1931," ''International History Review''(1997) 19:4, pp 789-808 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07075332.1997.9640804 online]</ref>

In 1938, as war clouds gathered in Europe, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt gave a public speech at  Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, declaring that the United States would not sit idly by if another power tried to dominate Canada. Diplomats saw it as a clear warning to Germany not to attack Canada.<ref>Arnold A. Offner, ''American Appeasement: United States Foreign Policy and Germany, 1933-1938'' (1969) p. 256</ref>

===World War II===
[[Image:Mountie and Trooper 1941.jpg|thumb|left|A Canadian [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mountie]] and an American [[Maine State Police|Maine State Trooper]] on their respective sides of the [[Maine]] - [[Quebec]] border in 1941]]
The two nations cooperated closely in World War II,<ref>Galen Roger Perras, ''Franklin Roosevelt and the Origins of the Canadian-American Security Alliance, 1933-1945'' (1998)</ref> as both nations saw new levels of prosperity and a determination to defeat the Axis powers. Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] were determined not to repeat the mistakes of their predecessors.<ref>Richard Jensen, "Nationalism and Civic Duty in Wartime: Comparing World Wars in Canada and America," ''Canadian Issues / Thèmes Canadiens,'' December 2004, pp 6-10</ref> They met in August 1940 at Ogdensburg, issuing a declaration calling for close cooperation, and formed the [[Permanent Joint Board on Defense]] (PJBD).

King sought to raise Canada's international visibility by hosting the August 1943 [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quadrant conference]] in Quebec on military and political strategy; he was a gracious host but was kept out of the important meetings by [[Winston Churchill]] and Roosevelt.

Canada allowed the construction of the [[Alaska Highway]] and participated in the building of the atomic bomb. 49,000 Americans joined the RCAF (Canadian) or RAF (British) air forces through the [[Clayton Knight Committee]], which had Roosevelt's permission to recruit in the U.S. in 1940-42.<ref>Rachel Lea Heide, "Allies in Complicity: The United States, Canada, and the Clayton Knight Committee's Clandestine Recruiting of Americans for the Royal Canadian Air Force, 1940-1942," ''Journal of the Canadian Historical Association, 2004'', Vol. 15, pp 207-230</ref>

American attempts in the mid-1930s to integrate British Columbia into a united West Coast military command had aroused Canadian opposition. Fearing a Japanese invasion of Canada's vulnerable coast, American officials urged the creation of a united military command for an eastern Pacific Ocean [[Theater (warfare)|theater of war]]. Canadian leaders feared American imperialism and the loss of autonomy more than a Japanese invasion. In 1941, Canadians successfully argued within the PJBD for mutual cooperation rather than unified command for the West Coast.<ref>Galen Roger Perras, "Who Will Defend British Columbia? Unity of Command on the West Coast, 1934-1942," ''Pacific Northwest Quarterly,'' Spring 1997, Vol. 88 Issue 2, pp 59-69</ref>

====Newfoundland====
The United States built large military bases in [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], at the time, a British crown colony. The American involvement ended the depression and brought new prosperity; Newfoundland's business community sought closer ties with the United States as expressed by the [[Economic Union Party]]. Ottawa took notice and wanted Newfoundland to join Canada, which it did after hotly contested referenda.   There was little demand in the United States for the acquisition of Newfoundland, so the United States did not protest the British decision not to allow an American option on the [[Newfoundland referendums, 1948|Newfoundland referendum]].<ref>Karl McNeil Earle, "Cousins of a Kind: The Newfoundland and Labrador Relationship with the United States" ''American Review of Canadian Studies'' (1998) 28#4 pp 387-411</ref>

===Cold War===
Following co-operation in the two World Wars, Canada and the United States lost much of their previous animosity. As Britain's influence as a global imperial power declined, Canada and the United States became extremely close partners. Canada was a close ally of the United States during the [[Cold War]].

===Nixon Shock 1971===
[[File:American President Nixon address joint session of the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa 1972.JPG|thumb|left|Richard Nixon addresses a [[joint session (Canada)|joint session]] of the Parliament of Canada, 1972.]]
The United States had become Canada's largest market, and after the war the Canadian economy became dependent on smooth trade flows with the United States so much that in 1971 when the United States enacted the "[[Nixon Shock]]" economic policies (including a 10% tariff on all imports) it put the Canadian government into a panic. This led in a large part to the articulation of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau]]'s "[[Third Option]]" policy of diversifying Canada's trade and downgrading the importance of Canada – United States relations. In a 1972 speech in Ottawa, Nixon declared the "special relationship" between Canada and the United States dead.<ref>Bruce Muirhead, "From Special Relationship to Third Option: Canada, the U.S., and the Nixon Shock," ''American Review of Canadian Studies,'' Vol. 34, 2004 [http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5008438189 online edition]

===1980s===
Issues in Canada–U.S. relations in the 1980s included the [[kidnapping of Sidney Jaffe]] from Canada by an American [[bail bondsman]], U.S. testing of [[cruise missile]]s on Canadian soil, and the signing of the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]].<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Clearwater|title=Just Dummies: Cruise Missile Testing in Canada|publisher=University of Calgary Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1552382110}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Clare E.|last=Lewis|title=Unlawful Arrest: A Bar to the Jurisdiction of the Court, or Mala Captus Bene Detentus: Sidney Jaffe: A Case in Point|journal=Criminal Law Quarterly|volume=28|page=341|year=1986}}</ref>

==Anti-Americanism==
{{Further2|[[Anti-Americanism#Canada|Anti-Americanism in Canada]]}}
Since the arrival of the Loyalists as refugees from the American Revolution in the 1780s, historians have identified a constant theme of Canadian fear of the United States and of "[[Americanization]]" or a cultural takeover. In the War of 1812, for example, the enthusiastic response by French militia to defend Lower Canada reflected, according to Heidler and Heidler (2004), "the fear of Americanization."<ref>David Stephen Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'' (2004) p. 194</ref> Scholars have traced this attitude over time in Ontario and Quebec.<ref>J. L. Granatstein, ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997)</ref>

Canadian intellectuals who wrote about the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century identified America as the world center of modernity, and deplored it. Imperialists (who admired the British Empire) explained that Canadians had narrowly escaped American conquest with its rejection of tradition, its worship of "progress" and technology, and its mass culture; they explained that Canada was much better because of its commitment to orderly government and societal harmony.  There were a few ardent defenders of the nation to the south, notably liberal and socialist intellectuals such as [[F. R. Scott]] and Jean-Charles Harvey (1891-1967).<ref>Damien-Claude Bélanger, ''Prejudice and Pride: Canadian Intellectuals Confront the United States, 1891-1945'' (University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp 16, 180</ref>

Looking at television, Collins (1990) finds that it is in English Canada that fear of cultural Americanization is most powerful, for there the attractions of the U.S. are strongest.<ref>Richard Collins, ''Culture, communication, and national identity: the case of Canadian television'' (U. of Toronto Press, 1990) p. 25</ref> Meren (2009) argues that after 1945, the emergence of Quebec nationalism and the desire to preserve French-Canadian cultural heritage led to growing anxiety regarding American cultural imperialism and Americanization.<ref>David Meren,  "'Plus que jamais nécessaires': Cultural Relations, Nationalism and the State in the Canada-Quebec-France Triangle, 1945-1960," ''Journal of the Canadian Historical Association,'' 2009, Vol. 19 Issue 1, pp 279-305,</ref> In 2006 surveys showed that 60 percent of Quebecers had a fear of Americanization, while other surveys showed they preferred their current situation to that of the Americans in the realms of health care, quality of life as seniors, environmental quality, poverty, educational system, racism and standard of living. While agreeing that job opportunities are greater in America, 89 percent disagreed with the notion that they would rather be in the United States, and they were more likely to feel closer to English Canadians than to Americans.<ref name="autogenerated114">Paula Ruth Gilbert, ''Violence and the female imagination: Quebec's women writers'' (2006) p. 114</ref> However, there is evidence that the elites and Quebec are much less fearful of Americanization, and much more open to economic integration than the general public.<ref name="autogenerated114"/>

The history has been traced in detail by a leading Canadian historian J.L. Granatstein in ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997). Current studies report the phenomenon persists. Two scholars report, "Anti-Americanism is alive and well in Canada today, strengthened by, among other things, disputes related to NAFTA, American involvement in the Middle East, and the ever-increasing Americanization of Canadian culture."<ref>{{cite book|author1=Barbara S.

==Relations between political executives==
The executive of each country is represented differently. In the United States, the president is both head of state and head of government, and his "administration" is the executive. In Canada the prime minister is head of government only, and his or her "government" or "ministry" directs the executive.

===Mulroney and Reagan===
[[Image:Photograph of The Reagans and Mulroneys in Quebec, Canada - NARA - 198561.jpg|thumb|right|The Mulroneys with President and Mrs. Reagan in Quebec, Canada, 18 March 1985, the day after the two leaders famously sang "When Irish Eyes are Smiling".]]
Relations between [[Brian Mulroney]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were famously close. This relationship resulted in negotiations on a potential free trade agreement, and a treaty of acid rain causing emissions, both major policy goals of Mulroney, that would be finalized under the presidency of [[George H. W. Bush]].

===Chrétien and Clinton===
Although [[Jean Chrétien]] was wary to appearing too close to the president, personally, he and [[Bill Clinton]] were known to be golfing partners. Their governments had many small trade quarrels over magazines, softwood lumber, and so on, but on the whole were quite friendly. Both leaders had run on reforming or abolishing [[NAFTA]], but the agreement went ahead with the addition of environmental and labor side agreements. Crucially, the Clinton administration lent rhetorical support to Canadian unity during the [[Quebec referendum, 1995|1995 referendum in Quebec]] on independence from Canada.

===Bush and Chrétien===
[[File:Chretien and Bush shaking hands Sept 9 2002.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Chrétien and George Bush shake hands at a meeting in Detroit in 2002.]]
Relations between Chrétien and [[George W. Bush]] were strained throughout their overlapping times in office. Jean Chrétien publicly mused that U.S. foreign policy might be part of the "root causes" of terrorism  shortly after [[Attacks of September 11, 2001|the September 11 attacks]]. The Americans did not appreciate his "smug moralism", and Chrétien's public refusal to support the 2003 Iraq war was met with chagrin in the United States, especially among conservatives.<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Drache|title=Big Picture Realities: Canada and Mexico at the Crossroads|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hKfvb5zf8oUC&pg=PA115|year=2008|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier U.P.|page=115}}</ref>

===Bush and Harper===
[[Stephen Harper]] and George W. Bush were thought to share warm personal relations and also close ties between their administrations. Because Bush was so unpopular in Canada, however, this was rarely emphasized by the Harper government.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2009/02/05/f-pms-presidents.html | work=CBC News | title=Prime ministers and presidents | date=2009-02-18}}</ref>

Shortly after being congratulated by Bush for his victory in February 2006, Harper rebuked U.S. ambassador to Canada [[David Wilkins]] for criticizing the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives']] plans to assert Canada's sovereignty over the [[Arctic Ocean]] waters with military force.

===Harper and Obama===
President Obama's first international trip was to Canada on February 19, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090128/canada_obama_090128/20090128?hub=Politics |title=Obama to visit Canada Feb. 19, PMO confirms - CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref> Aside from Canadian lobbying against "Buy American" provisions in the U.S. [[2009 stimulus bill|stimulus package]], relations between the two administrations have been smooth.

====Canada-United States Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) (2011)====

On February 4, 2011, Harper and Obama issued a "Declaration on a Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/04/joint-statement-president-obama-and-prime-minister-harper-canada-regul-0 |title=Joint Statement by President Obama and Prime Minister Harper of Canada on Regulatory Cooperation &#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=3931 |title=PM and U.S. President Obama announce shared vision for perimeter security and economic competitiveness between Canada and the United States - Prime Minister of Canada |publisher=Pm.gc.ca |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref> and announced the creation of the [[Regulatory Cooperation Council|Canada-United States Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC)]] "to increase regulatory transparency and coordination between the two countries." <ref name=OPM1>{{cite web |date=December 7, 2011 |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=4511 |accessdate= |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Canada |title=United States-Canada Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) Joint Action Plan: Developing and implementing the Joint Action Plan}}</ref>

[[Health Canada]] and the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) under the RCC mandate, undertook the "first of its kind" initiative by selecting "as its first area of alignment common cold indications for certain over-the-counter antihistamine ingredients (GC 2013-01-10)." <ref name=GC20130110>{{cite web |publisher=Government of Canada |series=Canada's Action Plan |title=Notice: Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) Over-the-Counter (OTC) Products: Common Monograph Working Group: Selection of a Monograph for Alignment |url=http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/rcc-ccr/notice-regulatory-cooperation-council-rcc-over |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=February 15, 2013 }}</ref>

Critics of the plan have compared Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) to the [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America|SPP]], without Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gabriel |first=Dana |url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=GAB20110206&articleId=23109 |title=The Integration of Canada and the USA: "The Security Perimeter" Derogates National Sovereignty |publisher=Globalresearch.ca |date=2011-02-06 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>  On Wednesday, December 7, Harper flew to Washington to meet with Obama and sign an agreement to implement the joint action plans that had been developed since the initial meeting in February.  The plans called on both countries to spend more on border infrastructure, share more information on people who cross the border, and acknowledge more of each other's safety and security inspection on third-country traffic.  An editorial in ''The Globe and Mail'' praised the agreement for giving Canada the ability to track whether failed refugee claimants have left Canada via the U.S. and for eliminating "duplicated baggage screenings on connecting flights".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/editorials/canada-us-border-agreement-a-good-thing/article2263711/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Canada-U.S. border agreement a good thing | date=2012-09-06}}</ref>  The agreement is not a legally-binding treaty, and relies on the political will and ability of the executives of both governments to implement the terms of the agreement. These types of executive agreements are routine—on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border.

==Military and security==
[[Image:NORADCommandCenter.jpg|thumb|[[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD), long headquartered in the [[Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker|Cheyenne Mountain]] Operations Center in Colorado, exemplifies military co-operation between Canada and the U.S.]]

The [[Canadian Forces|Canadian military]], like forces of other NATO countries, fought alongside the United States in most major conflicts since [[World War II]], including the [[Korean War]], the [[Gulf War]], the [[Kosovo War]], and most recently the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. The main exceptions to this were the Canadian government's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Iraq War]], which caused some brief diplomatic tensions. Despite these issues, military relations have remained close.

American defense arrangements with Canada are more extensive than with any other country.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2089.htm Background note on Canada], U.S. State Department</ref> The [[Permanent Joint Board of Defense]], established in 1940, provides policy-level consultation on bilateral defense matters. The United States and Canada share [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) mutual security commitments. In addition, American and Canadian military forces have cooperated since 1958 on continental air defense within the framework of the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD). Canadian forces have provided indirect support for the American invasion of Iraq that began in 2003.<ref>{{cite book|author=Patrick Lennox|title=At Home and Abroad: The Canada-US Relationship and Canada's Place in the World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EiHkgmCcxicC&pg=PA107|year=2009|publisher=UBC Press|page=107}}</ref>  Moreover, interoperability with the American armed forces has been a guiding principle of Canadian military force structuring and doctrine since the end of the Cold War.

In commemoration of the 200th Anniversary of the War of 1812 ambassadors from Canada and the US, and naval officers from both countries gathered at the [[Pritzker Military Library]] on August 17, 2012, for a panel discussion on Canada-US relations with emphasis on national security-related matters. Also as part of the commemoration, the navies of both countries sailed together throughout the Great Lakes region.<ref>[http://www.pritzkermilitarylibrary.org/Home/Ties-That-Bind.aspx Webcast Panel Discussion] "Ties That Bind" at the [[Pritzker Military Library]] on August 17, 2012</ref>

===War in Afghanistan===
{{Main|Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan}}
Canada's elite [[JTF2]] unit joined American special forces in Afghanistan shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|al-Qaida attacks on September 11, 2001]]. Canadian forces joined the multinational coalition in [[Operation Anaconda]] in January 2002. On April 18, 2002, an American pilot [[Tarnak Farm incident|bombed Canadian forces involved in a training exercise]], killing four and wounding eight Canadians. A joint American-Canadian inquiry determined the cause of the incident to be pilot error, in which the pilot interpreted ground fire as an attack; the pilot ignored orders that he felt were "second-guessing" his field tactical decision.<ref name="friendly fire cbc">{{cite news

==Trade==
{{Main|Canada–United States trade relations}}
Canada and the United States have the world's largest trading relationship, with huge quantities of goods and people flowing across the border each year. Since the 1987 [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]], there have been no [[tariff]]s on most goods passed between the two countries.

In the course of the [[Canada–United States softwood lumber dispute|softwood lumber dispute]], the U.S. has placed tariffs on Canadian [[softwood lumber]] because of what it argues is an unfair Canadian government subsidy, a claim which Canada disputes. The dispute has cycled through several agreements and arbitration cases. Other notable disputes include the [[Canadian Wheat Board]], and Canadian cultural "restrictions" on magazines and television (See [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], and [[National Film Board of Canada]]). Canadians have been criticized about such things as the ban on [[beef]] since a case of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|Mad Cow disease]] was discovered in 2003 in cows from the United States (and a few subsequent cases) and the high American agricultural subsidies. Concerns in Canada also run high over aspects of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) such as Chapter 11.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Miller|title=The Outlier Sectors: Areas of Non-free Trade in the North American Free Trade Agreement|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fwit1QwswY0C&pg=PA19|year=2002|publisher=BID-INTAL|page=19}}</ref>

One ongoing and complex trade issue involves the importation of cheaper [[prescription drugs]] from Canada to the United States. American drug companies—often supporters of political campaigns—have come out against the practice.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Clayton James Mosher|author2=Scott Akins|title=Drugs and Drug Policy: The Control of Consciousness Alteration|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aDMvoMxx0-IC&pg=PA341|year=2007|publisher=SAGE|page=341}}</ref>

==Environmental issues==
[[File:International Rangers.jpg|thumb|right|A Canadian [[BC Parks]] Ranger and a [[National Park Service|U.S. National Park Ranger]] work to remove a bear from a campground along the international boundary in British Columbia and Washington State.]]

A principal instrument of this cooperation is the [[International Joint Commission]] (IJC), established as part of the [[Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909]] to resolve differences and promote international cooperation on boundary waters. The [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement]] of 1972 is another historic example of joint cooperation in controlling trans-border water pollution.<ref>http://ottawa.usembassy.gov/content/textonly.asp?section=can_usa&document=environment</ref> However, there have been some disputes. Most recently, the [[Devil's Lake (North Dakota)|Devil's Lake]] Outlet, a project instituted by North Dakota, has angered Manitobans who fear that their water may soon become polluted as a result of this project.

Beginning in 1986 the Canadian government of Brian Mulroney began pressing the Reagan administration for an "Acid Rain Treaty" in order to do something about U.S. industrial air pollution causing [[acid rain]] in Canada. The Reagan administration was hesitant, and questioned the science behind Mulroney's claims. However, Mulroney was able to prevail. The product was the signing and ratification of the [[Air Quality Agreement]] of 1991 by the first Bush administration. Under that treaty, the two governments consult semi-annually on trans-border air pollution, which has demonstrably reduced acid rain, and they have since signed an annex to the treaty dealing with [[ground level ozone]] in 2000.<ref>http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/usca/index.htm</ref><ref>http://www.ec.gc.ca/air/default.asp?lang=En&n=83930AC3-1</ref><ref>http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/02/04/exclusive-interview-brian-mulroney-remembers-his-friend-ronald-reagan/</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-06/news/mn-139_1 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Kenneth | last1=Freed | first2=James | last2=Gerstenzang | date=1987-04-06 | title=Mulroney Asks Reagan for Treaty on Acid Rain}}</ref> Despite this, trans-border air pollution remains an issue, particularly in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence watershed during the summer. The main source of this trans-border pollution results from coal-fired power stations, most of them located in the [[Midwestern United States]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Edward S. Cassedy|author2=Peter Z.

As part of the negotiations to create [[NAFTA]], Canada and the U.S. signed, along with Mexico, the [[North American Agreement On Environmental Cooperation]] which created the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] which monitors environmental issues across the continent, publishing the [[North American Environmental Atlas]] as one aspect of its monitoring duties.<ref>http://www.cec.org/Page.asp?PageID=1226&SiteNodeID=310&BL_ExpandID=154</ref>

Currently neither of the countries' governments support the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which set out time scheduled curbing of greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike the United States, Canada has ratified the agreement. Yet after ratification, due to internal political conflict within Canada, the Canadian government does not enforce the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and has received criticism from environmental groups and from other governments for its climate change positions. In January 2011, the [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Canadian minister of the environment]], [[Peter Kent]], explicitly stated that the policy of his government with regards to greenhouse gas emissions reductions is to wait for the United States to act first, and then try to harmonize with that action - a position that has been condemned by environmentalists and Canadian nationalists, and as well as scientists and government think-tanks.<ref>http://money.canoe.ca/money/business/canada/archives/2011/01/20110128-152706.html</ref><ref>http://www.climateprosperity.ca/eng/studies/canada-us/report/media-release-canada-us-report-eng.php</ref>

In 2003 the American government became concerned when members of the Canadian government announced plans to [[decriminalization|decriminalize]] [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. David Murray, an assistant to U.S. [[Director of the National Drug Control Policy|Drug Czar]] [[John P. Walters]], said in a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] interview that, "We would have to respond. We would be forced to respond."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2003/05/02/us_pot_rxn030502.html |title=U.S. warns Canada against easing pot laws |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2003-05-02 |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> However the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|election]] of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] in early 2006 halted the liberalization of marijuana laws for the foreseeable future.

A 2007 joint report by American and Canadian officials on cross-border drug smuggling indicated that, despite their best efforts, "drug trafficking still occurs in significant quantities in both directions across the border. The principal illicit substances smuggled across our shared border are MDMA (''Ecstasy''), cocaine, and marijuana." - <ref>http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/le/oc/_fl/us-canadian-report-drugs-eng.pdf</ref> The report indicated that Canada was a major producer of ''Ecstasy'' and marijuana for the U.S. market, while the U.S. was a transit country for cocaine entering Canada.

==Diplomacy==

===Views of presidents and prime ministers===
Presidents and prime ministers typically make formal or informal statements that indicate the diplomatic policy of their administration. Diplomats and journalists at the time—and historians since—dissect the nuances and tone to detect the warmth or coolness of the relationship.

* Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]], speaking at the beginning of the [[Canadian federal election, 1891|1891 election]] (fought mostly over [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|Canadian free trade with the United States]]), denied Tory allegations that he wanted to amalgamate with the U.S. saying: "As for myself, my course is clear. A [[British subject]] I was born—a British subject I will die. With my utmost effort, with my latest breath, will I oppose the ‘veiled treason’ which attempts by sordid means and mercenary proffers to lure our people from their allegiance." (February 3, 1891.<ref>Histor!ca [http://www.histori.ca/prodev/article.do;jsessionid=8D3831D48EE489EBCF46813C8427E685.tomcat1?id=15356 "Election of 1891: A Question of Loyalty"], James Marsh.</ref>)

* Prime Minister [[John Sparrow Thompson]], angry at failed trade talks in 1888, privately complained to his wife, [[Annie Thompson|Lady Thompson]], that "These Yankee politicians are the lowest race of thieves in existence."<ref>Donald Creighton, ''John A. Macdonald: The  Old Chieftain'' (1955) p. 497</ref>

* After the World War II years of close military and economic cooperation, President [[Harry S. Truman]] said in 1947 that "Canada and the United States have reached the point where we can no longer think of each other as 'foreign' countries."<ref>Council on Foreign Relations, ''Documents on American foreign relations'' (1957) Volume 9 p 558</ref>

*President [[John F. Kennedy]] told Parliament in Ottawa in May 1961 that "Geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has made us allies. Those whom nature hath so joined together, let no man put asunder."<ref>John F. Kennedy. ''[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=8136 Address Before the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa]''. The American Presidency Project.</ref>

* President [[Lyndon Johnson]] helped open Expo '67 with an upbeat theme, saying that "We of the United States consider ourselves blessed. We have much to give thanks for. But the gift of providence we cherish most is that we were given as our neighbours on this wonderful continent the people and the nation of Canada." Remarks at [[Expo '67]], Montreal, May 25, 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canada.usembassy.gov/content/textonly.asp?section=can_usa&document=quotes |title=The Embassy of the U.S.A., Ottawa - United States - Canada Relations |publisher=Canada.usembassy.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>

{{listen | help = no | pos = right| filename = Trudeau sleeping with an elephant.ogg | title = Trudeau Washington Press Club speech | description = Trudeau's famous "sleeping with an elephant" quotation | format = [[Ogg]]}}
* Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]] famously said that being America's neighbour "is like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly and even-tempered the beast, if one can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt."<ref>From a speech by Trudeau to the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] in [[Washington, DC]], on March 25, 1969</ref><ref>J. L. Granatstein and Robert Bothwell, ''Pirouette: Pierre Trudeau and Canadian Foreign Policy''(1991) p 51</ref>

* Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]], sharply at odds with the U.S. over Cold War policy, warned at a press conference in 1971 that the overwhelming American presence posed "a danger to our national identity from a cultural, economic and perhaps even military point of view."<ref>J. L. Granatstein and Robert Bothwell, ''Pirouette: Pierre Trudeau and Canadian Foreign Policy''(1991) p 195</ref>

* President [[Richard Nixon]], in a speech to Parliament in 1972 was angry at Trudeau, declared that the "special relationship" between Canada and the United States was dead. "It is time for us to recognize," he stated, "that we have very separate identities; that we have significant differences; and that nobody's interests are furthered when these realities are obscured."<ref>J. L. Granatstein and Robert Bothwell, ''Pirouette: Pierre Trudeau and Canadian Foreign Policy''(1991) p 71</ref>

* In late 2001, President George W. Bush did not mention Canada during a speech in which he thanked a list of countries who had assisted in responding to the events of September 11, although Canada had provided military, financial, and other support.<ref>http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/gwbush911jointsessionspeech.htm</ref>

* Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], in a statement congratulating [[Barack Obama]] on his inauguration, stated that "The United States remains Canada’s most important ally, closest friend and largest trading partner and I look forward to working with President Obama and his administration as we build on this special relationship."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=3&id=2391|title=Statemente by Prime Minister Stephen Harper|accessdate=2009-01-21|date=2009-01-20|publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Canada}}</ref>

===Territorial disputes===
{{See also|List of areas disputed by Canada and the United States}}

These include [[maritime boundary]] disputes:

*[[Dixon Entrance]]
*[[Beaufort Sea]]
*[[Strait of Juan de Fuca]]
*[[San Juan Islands]]
*[[Machias Seal Island]] and [[North Rock]]

Territorial land disputes:

*[[Aroostook War]] ([[Maine]] boundary)
*[[Alaska Boundary Dispute]]
*[[Pig War]]

and disputes over the international status of the:

*[[Northwest Passage]]
*[[Inside Passage]]

====Arctic disputes====
A long-simmering dispute between Canada and the U.S. involves the issue of Canadian sovereignty over the [[Northwest Passage]] (the sea passages in the [[Arctic]]). Canada’s assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait ([[international waters]]). Canadians were alarmed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker {{SS|Manhattan|1962|2}} through the Northwest Passage in 1969, followed by the icebreaker [[USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11)|Polar Sea]] in 1985, which actually resulted in a [[1985 Polar Sea controversy|minor diplomatic incident]]. In 1970, the Canadian parliament enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a 100-mile zone. In response, the United States in 1970 stated, "We cannot accept the assertion of a Canadian claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada…. Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide." A compromise of sorts was reached in 1988, by an agreement on "Arctic Cooperation," which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers "will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada." However the agreement did not alter either country's basic legal position.  [[Paul Cellucci]], the American ambassador to Canada, in 2005 suggested to Washington that it should recognize the straits as belonging to Canada. His advice was rejected and Harper took opposite positions. The U.S. opposes Harper's proposed plan to deploy military icebreakers in the Arctic to detect interlopers and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters.<ref>Matthew Carnaghan, Allison Goody, [http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/researchpublications/prb0561-e.htm "Canadian Arctic Sovereignty"] (Library of Parliament: Political and Social Affairs Division, January 26, 2006); [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/01/26/wilkins-harper060126.html 2006 news]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070817/qp_cellucci_070819/20070819?hub=Politics |title=Cellucci: Canada should control Northwest Passage |publisher=CTV.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>
