{{nihongo|'''''Bubblegum Crisis'''''|バブルガムクライシス|Baburugamu Kuraishisu|lead=yes}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[cyberpunk]] [[OVA|OVA series]]. It displays strong influences from ''[[Blade Runner]]'', also making occasional references to it.

== Setting ==
The series begins in the late 2032, seven years after the Second Great Kanto Earthquake has split [[Tokyo]] geographically and culturally in two. During the first episode, disparities in wealth are shown to be more pronounced than in previous periods in post-war Japan.

The main antagonist is Genom, a [[megacorporation]] with immense power and global influence. Its main product are [[Boomer (Bubblegum Crisis)|boomers]] - cyberdroids used for manual labor and military purposes. While Boomers are intended to serve mankind, they become deadly instruments in the hands of ruthless individuals. The [[AD Police]] are tasked to deal with Boomer-related crimes. One of the series' themes is the inability of the department to deal with threats due to political infighting, red tape, and an insufficient budget.

The [[List of Bubblegum Crisis characters#Knight Sabers and allies|Knight Sabers]] are an all-female [[mercenary]] team and have considerable combat abilities using highly advanced suits of powered armor. They battle against long odds to overcome grave threats throughout the OVA series and preserve the overall safety of Mega Tokyo.

The [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] series is eight episodes long. It was originally slated to run for 13 episodes, but due to legal problems between the two studios who jointly held the rights to the series, '''Artmic''' and '''Youmex''', the series was discontinued. The problems may have been brought on by the series' lackluster sales in [[Japan]]. In [[North America]], however, the series did comparatively well and remains a cult classic. 

In Japan, a number of comic books were produced that featured characters and storylines based in the BGC (a common abbreviation for the series name) universe. Some were very much thematically linked to the OVA series, while others were "one-shots" or comedy features. A number of artists participated in the creation of these comics, including [[Kenichi Sonoda]], who had produced the original Knight Saber character designs. A North American comic based in the Bubblegum Crisis Universe was published in [[English language|English]] by [[Dark Horse Comics]].

The series involves the adventures of the Knight Sabers, an all-women group of [[mercenaries]] who don [[powered armor]] and fight various problems, most frequently rogue [[Boomer (anime term)|boomer]]s. Boomers are humanoid robots designed to perform a variety of tasks, from construction and firefighting to combat; a particular model of Boomer, the BU-33S "Sexaroid", is designed for sexual purposes, and also in need of human blood, as revealed in episode 5.

One of the central themes of the series, showing strong influence from ''[[Blade Runner]]'', is the exploration of what "[[human]]" really means. As in ''Blade Runner'', this is often accomplished through a focus on the characters of certain androids, particularly BU-33S.

Bubblegum Crisis is notable also in that it was one of the few early anime series that were brought over from [[Japan]] unedited and subtitled with [[English language|English]] captions that still have a great deal of popularity today. While anime has become much more popular in the intervening years, in 1991 it was still mostly unknown as a storytelling medium in North America. 

In 1997, a new series was created, titled ''[[Bubblegum Crisis 2040]]'', but was not a sequel to the original OVA series. Headed by [[Chiaki J. Konaka]], it was a standalone television series, and while it used similar themes to the original, it employed new designs for the characters and the mechanical devices. This series ran for twenty six episodes. Some discussion has taken place between the production companies for a second season, tentatively titled ''Bubblegum Crisis 2041''.

Despite the age of the original series, a non-Japanese fandom still exists for it. The community of fans have produced large quantities of [[Fan fiction]] and [[Fan art]] based on both the OVA and television series with the current estimated count of fanfiction in English language alone well exceeding four hundred texts,<ref name="fiction-guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.ravensgarage.com/bgcfanfic_guide/bgc.html |title=Bubblegum Crisis Fan Fiction Guide |accessdate=2009-03-28 |year=2000}} Last version of the guide names 350 texts</ref><ref name="fiction-archive">{{cite web|url=http://archives.eyrie.org/anime/BGC/ |title=Bubblegum Crisis fanfiction archive |accessdate=2007-03-28}} The BGC fanfiction repository on eyrie.org archive has over 400 texts. These do not fully overlap with ones named in the Fanfiction guide.</ref><ref name="fanfiction.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/anime/Bubblegum_Crisis/ |title=fanfiction.net Bubblegum Crisis category |accessdate=2007-07-19}}The Bubblegum Crisis category on fanfiction.net lists further 292 texts, although it is unknown how many of them overlap with previously mentioned sources.</ref> though there is a preponderance of works and discussion based on the original series.

Bubblegum Crisis has many features that have proven attractive to many viewers of anime. The mecha designs, cyberpunk characters, and post-apocalyptic city of Megatokyo are well-realized and leave a lasting impression. The storylines are varied and complex, with some elements left deliberately unexplained and open to interpretation. 

The music throughout the original OVA series is one of the most recognizable in anime fandom and generates a strong feeling of 1980s nostalgia. The opening song and sequence for the first OVA, as well as many of the other songs throughout the series, clearly draw inspiration from the 1984 movie [[Streets of Fire]]. Nearly all of the music is available, as there are 8 soundtrack releases (one per OVA), as well as numerous "vocal" albums which feature songs "inspired by" the series as well as many drawn directly from it. As a consequence Bubblegum Crisis, with its better than 1:1 soundtrack album to episode ratio (when one considers the "vocal" albums), may arguably have among the highest number of [[album|album-length]] music collections (percentage-wise) which may be attributed to any single title in contemporary anime.

A [[roleplaying game]] based on the series was published by [[R. Talsorian]] in 1997 under the [[Fuzion]] system. It contains many original sketches of the characters, mecha and settings, as well as detailed background information about them. A supplement detailing the 1997 series was planned, but could not be completed before RTG's license expired in 2002.

A digitally-remastered compilation of the original series' episodes, featuring bi-lingual tracks and production extras, was released on DVD in 2004 by [[AnimEigo]] Inc. Animeigo is currently crowd-funding the show for Blu-ray on [[Kickstarter]]. <ref>http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/madoverlord/bubblegum-crisis-ultimate-edition-blu-ray-set</ref>
