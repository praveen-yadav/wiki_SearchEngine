Cardinal '''Albert of Brandenburg''' (German: ''Albrecht von Brandenburg'') (28 June 1490 – 24 September 1545) was [[Prince-elector|Elector]] and [[Archbishop of Mainz]] from 1514 to 1545, and [[Archbishop of Magdeburg]] from 1513 to 1545.

==Biography==
Born in [[Cölln]], Albert was the younger son of [[John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg]] and [[Margaret of Thuringia]].

After their father's death, Albert and his older brother [[Joachim I Nestor]] became [[Margrave of Brandenburg|margraves of Brandenburg]] in 1499, but only his older brother held the title of an [[elector of Brandenburg]]. Having studied at the university of [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], Albert entered the ecclesiastical profession, and in 1513 became [[archbishop]] of [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]] at the age of 23 and administrator of the [[Diocese of Halberstadt]].  

In 1514 he obtained the [[Electorate of Mainz]], and in 1518 was made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] at the age of 28.  To pay for the [[pallium]] of the [[Holy See|see of Mainz]] and to discharge the other expenses of his elevation, Albert had borrowed 21,000 [[ducat]]s from [[Jakob Fugger]], and had obtained permission from [[Pope Leo X]] to conduct the sale of [[indulgences]] in his diocese to obtain funds to repay this loan, as long as half of the collection was forwarded to the Papacy. An agent of the Fuggers subsequently traveled in the Cardinal's retinue in charge of the cashbox.  He procured the services of [[John Tetzel]] to sell the indulgences.  

This so infuriated [[Martin Luther]] that he was driven to write his famous [[95 Theses]] which led to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].  Luther sent these to Albert on 31 October 1517 and according to tradition nailed them to the door of Castle Church in [[Wittenberg]]. Albert forwarded the theses to Rome, suspecting them of heresy. When the imperial election of 1519 drew near, the elector's vote was eagerly solicited by the partisans of soon to be [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]) and by those of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], King of France, and Albert appears to have received a large amount of money for his vote, which he cast eventually for Charles.

Albert's large and liberal ideas, his friendship with [[Ulrich von Hutten]], and his political ambitions, appear to have raised hopes that he could be won over to [[Protestantism]]; but after the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525 he ranged himself definitely among the supporters of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], and was among the princes who met at [[Dessau]] in July 1525.

Cardinal Albert needed a prestigious church that met his expectations at a central location in his ''[[Residenz]]'' town. Albert, feared for his peace of mind in heaven, and collected more than 8,100 [[relics#Roman Catholic classification and prohibitions|relics]] and 42 holy [[human skeleton|skeletons]] which needed to be stored. These precious treasures known as "Hallesches Heilthum" and indirectly related to the sale of [[indulgences]] had triggered the Reformation a few years before. Then the cardinal and the Roman Catholic members of the town council wanted to repress the growing influence of [[the Reformation]] by holding far grander [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]] and [[church service|services]] in a new church dedicated solely to Saint Mary.

His hostility towards the reformers, however, was not so extreme as that of his brother [[Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg]]; and he appears to have exerted himself towards peace, although he was a member of the [[League of Nuremberg]], formed in 1538 as a counterpoise to the [[League of Schmalkalden]].  The new doctrines nevertheless made considerable progress in his dominions, and he was compelled to grant religious liberty to the inhabitants of Magdeburg in return for 500,000 [[German florin|florin]]s.  During his latter years showed more intolerance towards the Protestants, and favoured the teaching of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in his dominions.  

===Market Church of Our Lady===
The [[Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen|Market Church of Our Lady]] in Halle, which had been built to defend against the spread of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] sympathies, was the very spot where [[Justus Jonas]] officially introduced the Reformation into Halle with his [[Good Friday]] sermon in 1541. The service must have been at least partly conducted in the open air, because at that time construction had only been finished at the eastern end of the nave. Jonas began a successful preaching crusade and attracted so many people the church overflowed. Cardinal Albert left the town for good, after the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] (''Stände'') in the city had announced that they would take over his enormous debt at the bank of [[Jacob Fugger]]. Halle became Protestant and in 1542 Jonas was appointed as priest to St. Mary's and in 1544 bishop over the city. 

Albert adorned the [[collegiate church]] (''Stiftskirche'')  at [[Halle (Saale)]] and the [[Mainz Cathedral|cathedral at Mainz]] in sumptuous fashion, and took as his motto the words ''Domine, dilexi decorem domus tuae'' (Latin for: "Lord, I admired the adornment of your house."). A generous patron of art and learning, he counted [[Erasmus]] among his friends.  

He died at [[Aschaffenburg]] in 1545.
