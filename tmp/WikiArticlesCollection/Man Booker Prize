The '''Man Booker Prize for Fiction''' is a [[Literary award|literary prize]] awarded each year for the best original full-length novel, written in the English language, by a citizen of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the Republic of Ireland, or Zimbabwe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themanbookerprize.com/sites/default/files//files/2012%20Rules%20Entry%20Form%20FINAL.pdf|title=Booker Prize: rules & entry form|work=bookerprize.com|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> Beginning in 2014, it will consider authors from anywhere in the world, so long as their work is in English and published in the UK. The winner of the Man Booker Prize is generally assured of international renown and success; therefore, the prize is of great significance for the book trade.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2008/10/booker-prize-british-literary|title=The Booker's Big Bang|work=New Statesman|date=9 October 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref>

The Booker Prize is greeted with great anticipation and fanfare.<ref>{{cite news|first=Bob|last=Hoover|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/08041/855698-44.stm|title='Gathering' storm clears for prize winner Enright|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=10 February 2008|accessdate=10 February 2008|quote=In America, literary prizes are greeted with the same enthusiasm as a low Steelers draft choice. Not so in the British Isles, where the $98,000 Man Booker Fiction Prize can even push Amy Winehouse off the front page – at least for a day. The atmosphere around the award approaches sports-championship proportions, with London bookies posting the ever-changing odds on the nominees. Then, in October when the winner is announced live on the BBC TV evening news, somebody always gets ticked off.}}</ref> It is also a mark of distinction for authors to be selected for inclusion in the [[Short list|shortlist]] or even to be nominated for the "longlist".

The [[2013 Man Booker Prize|2013]] winner, announced on 15 October, was ''[[The Luminaries]]'' by Canadian-born New Zealand author [[Eleanor Catton]].

==History and administration==
The prize was originally known as the '''Booker-McConnell Prize,''' after the company [[Booker-McConnell]] began sponsoring the event in 1968;<ref name=history>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/oct/18/booker-prize-history-controversy-criticism|title=Man Booker Prize: a history of controversy, criticism and literary greats|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> it became commonly known as the "Booker Prize" or simply "the Booker." When administration of the prize was transferred to the Booker Prize Foundation in 2002, the title sponsor became the investment company [[Man Group]], which opted to retain "Booker" as part of the official title of the prize. The foundation is an independent registered charity funded by the entire profits of Booker Prize Trading Ltd, of which it is the sole shareholder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themanbookerprize.com/legal|title=Booker Prize: legal information|work=bookerprize.com|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> The prize money awarded with the Booker Prize was originally £21,000, and was subsequently raised to £50,000 in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group, making it one of the [[List of the world's richest literary prizes|world's richest literary prizes]].

In 1970 [[Bernice Rubens]] became the first woman to win the Man Booker Prize, for ''[[The Elected Member]]''.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/article/539083/brief-history-man-booker-prize James Kidd, "A Brief History of The Man Booker Prize".]</ref> The rules of the Booker changed in 1971; previously, it had been awarded retrospectively to books published prior to the year in which the award was given. In 1971 the year of eligibility was changed to the same as the year of the award; in effect, this meant that books published in 1970 were not considered for the Booker in either year. The Booker Prize Foundation announced in January 2010 the creation of a special award called the "[[Lost Man Booker Prize]]," with the winner chosen from a longlist of 22 novels published in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/stories/1317|title=The Lost Man Booker Prize announced|work=bookerprize.com|accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref>

[[Alice Munro]] has a unique place in Booker Prize history; ''[[The Beggar Maid]]'' is the only short story collection to have been shortlisted.  (It was shortlisted in 1980.)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jul/13/big-novels-2012|title=Dear Life: Stories by Alice Munro (Chatto & Windus, November)|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=13 July 2012|quote=As the only writer to sneak on to the Booker shortlist for a collection of short stories (with ''The Beggar Maid'' in 1980), Alice Munro easily deserves to end our list of the year's best fiction.}}</ref>

Before 2001, each year's longlist of nominees was not publicly revealed.<ref>{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Yates|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/aug/15/bookerprize2001.thebookerprize|title=Booker Prize longlist announced for first time|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=15 August 2001|accessdate=15 August 2001}}</ref>

[[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]], who was a judge for the 1999 prize, has said, {{cquote|There is a well-established London literary community. [[Salman Rushdie|Rushdie]] doesn't get shortlisted now because he has attacked that community. That is not a good game plan if you want to win the Booker. [[Norman Mailer]] has found the same thing in the US – you have to 'be a citizen' if you want to win prizes. The real scandal is that [[Martin Amis|<nowiki>[Martin]</nowiki> Amis]] has never won the prize. In fact, he has only been shortlisted once and that was for ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]'', which was not one of his strongest books. That really is suspicious. He pissed people off with ''[[Dead Babies (novel)|Dead Babies]]'' and that gets lodged in the culture. There is also the feeling that he has always looked towards America.<ref name=booker_fixed>{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Moss|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/sep/18/bookerprize2001.thebookerprize|title=Is the Booker fixed?|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=18 September 2001|accessdate=18 September 2001}}</ref>}}

===Controversies===
In 1972, the winning writer [[John Berger]], known for his [[Marxism|Marxist]] worldview, protested during his acceptance speech against Booker McConnell. He blamed Booker's 130 years of sugar production in the Caribbean for the region's modern poverty.<ref name=white/><ref name="John Berger on the Booker Prize (1972)">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otu4tjqrOk0 "John Berger on the Booker Prize (1972)"], YouTube.</ref> Berger donated half of his £5,000 prize to the British Black Panther movement, because they had a socialist and revolutionary perspective in agreement with his own.<ref name=history/><ref name=white>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=White|url=http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5NzIvMTEvMjUjQXIwMTEwMA==&Mode=Gif&Locale=english-skin-custom|title=Berger's black bread|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=25 November 1972}} p. 11.</ref><ref name="Speech by John Berger on accepting the Booker Prize for Fiction at the Café Royal in London on 23 November 1972">[http://gostbustere.tumblr.com/post/17158444595/speech-by-john-berger-on-accepting-the-booker-prize-for Speech by John Berger on accepting the Booker Prize for Fiction at the Café Royal in London on 23 November 1972].</ref>

In 1980, [[Anthony Burgess]], writer of ''[[Earthly Powers]]'', refused to attend the ceremony unless it was confirmed to him in advance whether he had won.<ref name=history/> His was one of two books considered likely to win, the other being ''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'' by [[William Golding]]. The judges decided only 30 minutes before the ceremony, giving the prize to Golding. Both novels had been seen as favourites to win leading up to the prize and the dramatic "literary battle" between two senior writers made front page news.<ref name=history/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5ODAvMTAvMjIjQXIwMDEwNA==&Mode=Gif&Locale=english-skin-custom|title=Lord of the novel wins the Booker prize|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=22 October 1980}} p. 1.</ref>

1983's judging produced a draw between [[J. M. Coetzee]]'s ''[[Life & Times of Michael K]]'' and [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[Shame (Rushdie novel)|Shame]]'', leaving chair of judges [[Fay Weldon]] to choose between the two. According to Stephen Moss in ''[[The Guardian]]'', "Her arm was bent and she chose Rushdie" only to change her mind as the result was being phoned through.<ref name=booker_fixed/>

In 1993, two of the judges threatened to walk out when ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' appeared on the longlist; [[Irvine Welsh]]'s novel was pulled from the shortlist to satisfy them. The novel would later receive critical acclaim, and is now considered Welsh's masterpiece.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Bissett|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2012/jul/27/booker-prize-bias-english?intcmp=239|title=The unnoticed bias of the Booker prize|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref>

The award has been criticised for the types of books it covers. In 1981, nominee [[John Banville]] wrote a letter to ''The Guardian'' requesting that the prize be given to him so that he could use the money to buy every copy of the longlisted books in Ireland and donate them to libraries, "thus ensuring that the books not only are bought but also read&nbsp;— surely a unique occurrence."<ref name=history/><ref>[http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5ODEvMTAvMTUjQXIwMTQwMg==&Mode=Gif&Locale=english-skin-custom "A novel way of striking a 12,000 Booker Prize bargain"], ''The Guardian'', 14 October 1981, p. 14.</ref>

In 1994, journalist [[Richard Gott]] described the prize as "a significant and dangerous iceberg in the sea of British culture that serves as a symbol of its current malaise."<ref name=history/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5OTQvMDkvMDUjQXIwMjIwMQ==&Mode=Gif&Locale=english-skin-custom|title=Novel way to run a lottery|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=5 September 1994}} p. 22.</ref>

In 1997, the decision to award [[Arundhati Roy]]'s ''[[The God of Small Things]]'' proved controversial. [[Carmen Callil]], chair of the previous year's Booker judges, called it an "execrable" book and was seen on television saying it shouldn't even have been on the shortlist. Booker Prize chairman Martyn Goff said Roy won because nobody objected, following the rejection by the judges of [[Bernard MacLaverty]]'s shortlisted book due to their dismissal of him as "a wonderful short-story writer and that ''[[Grace Notes]]'' was three short stories strung together."<ref>{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Glaister|url=http://www.sawnet.org/news/news220.html|title=Popularity pays off for Roy|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 October 1997}}</ref>

In 2001, [[A. L. Kennedy]], who was a judge in 1996, called the prize "a pile of crooked nonsense" with the winner determined by "who knows who, who's sleeping with who, who's selling drugs to who, who's married to who, whose turn it is".<ref name=booker_fixed/>

In the mid-2000s, the Booker Prize was passed around between Ireland and India, giving the impression that the literatures of these countries were more fashionable than ever. "Outsider" [[John Banville]] began this trend in 2005 when his novel ''[[The Sea (novel)|The Sea]]'' was selected, a decision greeted with shock and derision in England's famed London literary circle.<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=Ezard|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/oct/11/books.bookerprize2005?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title=Irish stylist springs Booker surprise|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 October 2005|accessdate=11 October 2005}}</ref> Boyd Tonkin, literary editor of ''The Independent'', famously condemned it as "possibly the most perverse decision in the history of the award" and rival novelist [[Tibor Fischer]] poured scorn on Banville's victory.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Crown|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/culturevultureblog/2005/oct/10/banvillescoops1?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Banville scoops the Booker|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 October 2005|accessdate=10 October 2005}}</ref> [[Kiran Desai]] of India won in 2006. [[Anne Enright]]'s 2007 victory came about due to a jury badly split over [[Ian McEwan]]'s novel ''[[On Chesil Beach]]''. The following year it was India's turn again, with [[Aravind Adiga]] narrowly defeating Enright's fellow Irishman [[Sebastian Barry]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Charlotte|last=Higgins|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/jan/28/costabookaward-poetry|title=How Adam Foulds was a breath away from the Costa book of the year award|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 January 2009|accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref>

===Expansion to include authors regardless of country of origin===

On 18 September 2013 it was announced that future Man Booker Prize awards would consider authors from anywhere in the world, so long as their work was in [[English language|English]] and published in the UK.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24145501 Will Gompertz, "Global expansion for Booker Prize"], BBC News, 18 September 2013.</ref> This change proved controversial in literary circles.<ref name=BBC_rulechange2>{{cite web|title='A surprise and a risk': Reaction to Booker Prize upheaval|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24126882|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=18 September 2013}}</ref>

==Judging==
The selection process for the winner of the prize commences with the formation of an advisory committee which includes a writer, two publishers, a literary agent, a bookseller, a librarian, and a chairperson appointed by the Booker Prize Foundation. The advisory committee then selects the judging panel, the membership of which changes each year, although on rare occasions a judge may be selected a second time. Judges are selected from amongst leading literary critics, writers, academics and leading public figures.

The winner is usually announced at a ceremony in London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], usually in early October.

==Winners==

In 1993 to mark the 25th anniversary it was decided to choose a ''Booker of Bookers Prize''. Three previous judges of the award, [[Malcolm Bradbury]], David Holloway and W. L. Webb, met and chose [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' (the 1981 winner) as "the best novel out of all the winners."<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=Mullan|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview31|title=Lives & letters, Where are they now?|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=12 July 2008|accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>

A similar prize known as [[The Best of the Booker]] was awarded in 2008 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the prize. A shortlist of six winners was chosen and the decision was left to a public vote. The winner was again ''Midnight's Children''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michelle| last=Pauli|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2258500,00.html|title=Best of the Booker|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7499495.stm|title=Rushdie wins Best of Booker prize|work=|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref>

| In 1971, the nature of the Prize was changed so that it was awarded to novels published in that year instead of in the previous year; therefore, no novel published in 1970 could win the Booker Prize. This was rectified in 2010 by the awarding of the "[[Lost Man Booker Prize]]" to J. G. Farrell's ''Troubles''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Melvern |first=Jack|title=J G Farrell wins Booker prize for 1970, 30-year after his death|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article7131357.ece|accessdate=23 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=20 May 2010 }}</ref>

==Facts and statistics==
*Each publisher's imprint may submit two titles. In addition, previous winners of the prize and those who have been shortlisted in the previous five years are automatically considered. Books may also be called in: publishers can make written representations to the judges to consider titles in addition to those already entered. In the 21st century the average number of books considered by the judges has been approximately 130.{{fact}}-->

==Related awards==
A separate prize for which any living writer in the world may qualify, the [[Man Booker International Prize]], was inaugurated in 2005 and is awarded biennially. A Russian version of the Booker Prize was created in 1992 called the [[Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize]], also known as the Russian Booker Prize. In 2007, Man Group plc established the [[Man Asian Literary Prize]], an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.

==Cheltenham Booker Prize==
As part of ''[[The Times]]''' [[Cheltenham Literature Festival|Literature Festival]] in [[Cheltenham]], a Booker event is held on the last Saturday of the festival. Four guest speakers/judges debate a shortlist of four books from a given year from before the introduction of the Booker prize, and a winner is chosen. Unlike the real Man Booker, writers from outside the Commonwealth are also considered. In 2008, the winner for 1948 was [[Alan Paton]]'s ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'', beating [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'', [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' and [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[The Loved One]]''.
