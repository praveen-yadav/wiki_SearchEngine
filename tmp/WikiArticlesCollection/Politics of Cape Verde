{{Politics of Cape Verde}}
'''Politics of Cape Verde''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Cape Verde]] is the [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]].<ref name=constitution>{{cite web|url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/CapeVerde.pdf|title=Constitution of Cape Verde|year=1992|accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref> [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[National Assembly of Cape Verde|National Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
The constitution first approved in 1980 and substantially revised in 1992 forms the basis of government organization. It declares that the government is the "organ that defines, leads, and executes the general internal and external policy of the country" and is responsible to the National Assembly.

==Political conditions==
Following independence in 1975, the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) established a one party political system. This became the [[African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde]] (PAICV) in 1980, as Cape Verde sought to distance itself from [[Guinea-Bissau]], following unrest in that country.

In 1991, following growing pressure for a more pluralistic society, multi-party elections were held for the first time.  The opposition party, the [[Movement for Democracy (Cape Verde)|Movement for Democracy]] (MpD), won the legislative elections, and formed the government. The MpD candidate also defeated the PAICV candidate in the presidential elections. In the 1996 elections, the MpD increased their majority, but in the 2001 the PAICV returned to power, winning both the Legislative and the Presidential elections. 

Generally, Cape Verde enjoys a stable democratic system. The elections have been considered free and fair, there is a free press, and the rule of law is respected by the State. In acknowledgment of this, [[Freedom House]] granted Cape Verde two 1s in its annual [[Freedom in the World]] report, a perfect score. It is the only African country to receive this score.
