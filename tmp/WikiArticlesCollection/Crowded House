==History==
Neil Finn (vocals, guitar, piano) and drummer Paul Hester (ex-[[The Cheks]], [[Deckchairs Overboard]]) were former members of New Zealand band [[Split Enz]], which spent part of 1975–6 in Australia and several years in England.<ref name="McF"/> Neil is the younger brother of Split Enz founding member Tim Finn, who joined Crowded House in 1990 on vocals, guitars and keyboards for the album ''[[Woodface]]''.<ref name="McF"/> Bassist Nick Seymour (ex-Plays with Marionettes, Bang, The Horla) is the younger brother of singer-songwriter and guitarist [[Mark Seymour]]<ref name="McF"/> of the now defunct Australian rock group [[Hunters & Collectors]].<ref name="sss"/>

===Formation and name change (1984–1986)===

L to R: Paul Hester, Neil Finn, Nick Seymour.]]Thanks to their Split Enz connection, the newly formed Crowded House had an established [[Australasia]]n fanbase.<ref name="McF"/> They began by playing at festivals in Australia and New Zealand and released their debut album, ''Crowded House'', in June 1986.<ref name="McF"/> Capitol Records initially failed to see the band's potential and gave them only low key promotion,<ref name="sss"/> forcing the band to play at small venues to try and gain attention. The album's first single, "[[Mean to Me (Crowded House song)|Mean to Me]]", reached the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart top 30 in June.<ref name="Kent"/> It failed to chart in the US,<ref name="AllmusicSingle"/> but moderate American airplay introduced US listeners to the group.

The single, "[[Don't Dream It's Over]]", was released in December 1986 and reached number one on the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand Singles Chart]] and number eight in Australia.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZCharts"/> It was also a big international hit, reaching number two on the US Billboard Hot 100<ref name="AllmusicSingle"/> and number one in Canada.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0804&volume=46&issue=4&issue_dt=May%2002%201987&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=50lgngc1daom80fs32cjjs9ne6 "Top Singles – Volume 46, No.&nbsp;4, May&nbsp;02&nbsp;1987"] ''Library and Archives Canada''</ref> It remains the group's most commercially successful song.

As the band's primary songwriter, Neil Finn was under pressure to create a second album to match their debut and the band joked that one potential title for the new release was ''Mediocre Follow-Up''.<ref name="sss"/> Eventually titled ''Temple of Low Men'', their second album was released in July 1988 with strong promotion by Capitol Records. The album did not fare as well as their debut in the US, only reaching number 40,<ref name="AllmusicAlbum"/> but it achieved Australasian success, reaching number one in [[ARIA Charts|Australia]]<ref name="AusCharts"/> and number two in New Zealand.<ref name="NZCharts"/> The first single "[[Better Be Home Soon]]" peaked at number two on both Australian and New Zealand singles charts<ref name="AusCharts"/><ref name="NZCharts"/> and reached top 50 in the US,<ref name="AllmusicSingle"/> though the following four singles were less successful.<ref name="AusCharts"/><ref name="NZCharts"/> Crowded House undertook a short tour of Australia and Canada to promote the album, with Eddie Rayner on keyboards. Multi-instrumentalist Mark Hart, who would eventually become a full band member, replaced Rayner in January 1989. After the tour, Finn fired Seymour from the band.<ref name=denton /> [[Music journalist]] [[Ed Nimmervoll]] claimed that Seymour's temporary departure was because Finn blamed him for causing his [[writer's block]],<ref name="Howl"/> however Finn cited "artistic differences" as the reason.<ref name=denton /> Seymour said that after a month he contacted Finn and they agreed that he would return to the band.<ref name=denton />

===Early nineties (1991–1994)===

[[File:MarkHartCrop.jpg|thumb|right|Multi-instrumentalist Mark Hart]]

Crowded House took a break after the Canadian leg of the ''Temple of Low Men'' tour. Neil Finn and his brother Tim recorded songs they had co-written for their own album, ''[[Finn (album)|Finn]]''.<ref name="sss"/> Following the recording sessions with Tim, Neil began writing and recording a third Crowded House album with Hester and Seymour, but these tracks were rejected by the record company, so Neil asked Tim if Crowded House could use the ''Finn'' songs. Tim jokingly agreed on the proviso that he become a member, which Neil apparently took literally. With Tim as an official member, the band returned to the studio. The new tracks, as well as some from the previously rejected recordings were combined to make ''Woodface'', which was released in July 1991. The album features eight tracks co-written by Neil and Tim,<ref name="sss"/> which feature the brothers [[harmony|harmonising]] on lead vocals, except on the sombre "All I Ask" on which Tim sang lead. The track was later used on AIDS awareness commercials in Australia.<ref name="sss"/> Five of the album's tracks were Neil's solo compositions and two were by Hester, the exuberant "Italian Plastic", which became a crowd favourite at concerts<ref name="sss"/> and the [[hidden track]] "I'm Still Here".

"[[Chocolate Cake (song)|Chocolate Cake]]", a humorous comment on American excesses that wasn't taken well by some US critics and sections of the American public, was released in June 1991 as the first single. Perhaps unsurprisingly it failed to chart in the US, however it reached number two on Billboard's [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name="AllmusicSingle"/> The song peaked at number seven in New Zealand and reached the top 20 in Australia.<ref name="AusCharts"/><ref name="NZCharts"/> The second single, "[[Fall at Your Feet]]", was less successful in Australia and New Zealand but did at least reach the US [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].<ref name="AllmusicSingle"/> The album reached number one in New Zealand,<ref name="NZCharts"/> number two in Australia,<ref name="AusCharts"/> number six in the UK<ref name="UKCharts">[http://archive.is/20120530091438/http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=4856 "Chart Stats – Crowded House"] ''Chart Stats''</ref><ref>{{Cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=[[Guinness World Records|Guinness]]|location=London, UK|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=}}</ref> and made the top 20 in several European countries.<ref>[http://norwegiancharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Crowded+House "Discography Crowded House"] norwegiancharts.com</ref><ref>[http://swedishcharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Crowded+House "Discography Crowded House"] swedishcharts.com</ref><ref>[http://dutchcharts.nl/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Crowded+House "Discografie Crowded House"] dutchcharts.nl</ref> The third single from ''Woodface'', "[[Weather With You]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;7 in early 1992 giving the band their highest UK chart placement. By contrast, the album had limited success in the US, only reaching number 83 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart.<ref name="AllmusicAlbum"/>

Tim left Crowded House during the ''Woodface'' tour in November 1991, part-way through the UK leg.<ref name="McF"/> Performances on this tour, at the Town and Country Club in London, were recorded live and given a limited release in Australia, while individual songs from those shows were released as B-sides of singles in some countries.<ref>[http://www.amws.com.au/c/crowded-house/discography/discography.html "Crowded House Discography"] ''amws.com.au'' – 12 January 1994</ref> In June 1993 the [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand Government]] recommended that the Queen award an OBE to Neil and Tim Finn for their contribution to the music of New Zealand.<ref name="Hunkin"/>

For their fourth album, ''Together Alone'', Crowded House used producer [[Youth (producer)|Martin Glover (aka Youth)]] and invited touring musician Mark Hart (guitar & keyboards) to become a permanent band member.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/> The album was recorded at [[Karekare, New Zealand|Karekare]] Beach, New Zealand, which gave its name to the opening track, "Kare Kare". The album was released in October 1993 and sold well internationally on the strength of lead single "[[Distant Sun]]" and followup "[[Private Universe]]". It topped the New Zealand Album Chart,<ref name="NZCharts"/> reached number 2 in Australia<ref name="AusCharts"/> and number 4 in the UK.<ref name="UKCharts"/> "[[Locked Out]]" was the album's first US single and received airplay on MTV and [[VH1]].

Crowded House were mid way through a US tour when Paul Hester quit the band on 15 April 1994.<ref name="Howl"/> He flew home to Melbourne to await the birth of his first child and indicated that he required more time with his family.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/> [[Wally Ingram]], drummer for support act [[Sheryl Crow]], temporarily filled in<ref name="Howl"/> until a replacement, [[Peter Jones (drummer)|Peter Jones]] (ex-Harem Scarem, [[Vince Jones]], [[Kate Ceberano]]'s Septet) was found.<ref name="McF"/> After the tour, the [[Finn Brothers]] released their album ''Finn'' in November 1995. In June 1996, at a press conference to announce the release of their greatest hits album ''[[Recurring Dream (album)|Recurring Dream]]'', Neil revealed that Crowded House were to disband. The June 1996 concerts in Europe and Canada were to be their final performances.<ref name="sss" />

''Recurring Dream'' contained four songs from each of the band's studio albums, along with three new songs. The album debuted at number one in Australia,<ref name="AusCharts"/> New Zealand<ref name="NZCharts"/> and the UK<ref name="UKCharts"/> in July 1996. Early copies included a bonus CD of live material. The album's three new songs, which were released as singles, were "[[Instinct (song)|Instinct]]", "[[Not the Girl You Think You Are]]" and "[[Everything Is Good for You]]", which featured backing vocals from [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Eddie Vedder]]. Paul Hester returned to the band to play drums on the three new tracks.<ref>Green, Peter & Post, Liz [http://www.frenz.com/crowdedhouse/timeline.html "Timeline – The Crowded House Refresher Course"] frenz.com</ref>

Worried that their goodbye had been too low-key and had disregarded their home fans, the band performed the ''Farewell to the World'' concert on the steps of the [[Sydney Opera House]] on 24 November 1996, which raised funds for the [[Sydney Children's Hospital]]. The concert featured the line-up of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart and Paul Hester. Tim Finn and Peter Jones both made guest appearances. Support bands on the day were [[Custard (band)|Custard]], [[Powderfinger]] and [[You Am I]].

===Between farewell and reunion (1996–2006)===
{{Main|Afterglow (Crowded House album)|Deadstar|7 Worlds Collide|Everyone Is Here|Tarmac Adam}}
[[File:Paul-hester-sf-np1.jpg|thumb|left|Paul Hester 1959–2005.]]Following the 1996 break-up of Crowded House, the members embarked upon a variety of projects. Neil Finn released two solo studio albums, ''[[Try Whistling This]]'' (1998) and ''[[One Nil]]'' (2001), as well as two live albums, ''[[Sessions at West 54th (Neil Finn album)|Sessions at West 54th]]'' (2000) and ''[[7 Worlds Collide (album)|7 Worlds Collide]]'' (2001). ''7 Worlds Collide'' saw him performing with guest musicians including [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Johnny Marr]], [[Ed O'Brien]] and [[Phil Selway]] of [[Radiohead]], Tim Finn, Sebastian Steinberg, [[Lisa Germano]] and Betchadupa (featuring his son [[Liam Finn]]). A double CD and DVD of the shows were released in November 2001.

Tim Finn had resumed his solo career after leaving the group in 1992 and he also worked with Neil on a second [[Finn Brothers]] album, ''Everyone Is Here'', which was released in 2004. Paul Hester joined The Finn Brothers on stage for three songs at their Palais Theatre show in Melbourne at the end of 2004. Nick Seymour also joined them on stage in Dublin, where he was living, in 2004. Peter Jones and Nick Seymour joined Australian group [[Deadstar]] for their second album, ''Milk'', in 1997. Seymour later worked as a record producer in Dublin, producing Irish group [[Bell X1]]'s debut album, ''[[Neither Am I]]'' in 2000. Mark Hart rejoined [[Supertramp]] in the late 1990s and later toured with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. In 2001 he released a solo album, ''Nada Sonata''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1214006|pure_url=yes}} "Nada Sonata > Overview"] AllMusic</ref>

Paul Hester worked with children's entertainers [[The Wiggles]], playing "Paul the Cook".<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376988/fullcredits#cast "Paul Hester"] [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> He also had his own [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] show ''Hessie's Shed'' in Australia from late 1997.<ref name="McF"/> He formed the band Largest Living Things,<ref name="McF"/> which was the name rejected by Capitol Records in favour of Crowded House.<ref name=hessie/> It was on ''Hessie's Shed'' that Finn, Hester and Seymour last shared a stage, on an episode filmed as part of Finn's promotion for his solo album ''Try Whistling This'' in 1998. Finn and Hester performed "[[Not the Girl You Think You Are]]" with Largest Living Things, before being joined by Seymour for "[[Sister Madly]]" and a version of [[Paul Kelly (musician)|Paul Kelly]]'s "[[Leaps and Bounds (song)|Leaps and Bounds]]", which also featured Kelly on vocals. In late 2003, Hester hosted the series ''Music Max's Sessions''. Hester and Seymour were reunited when they both joined singer-songwriter Matt O'Donnell's Melbourne-based group [[Tarmac Adam]].<ref>[http://hem2.passagen.se/honga/database/h/hesterpaul.html "Paul Hester"] ''[[Australian Rock Database]]''</ref> The band released one album, 2003's ''Handheld Torch'', which was produced by Seymour.

In May 1999 Crowded House issued a compilation of unreleased songs, ''[[Afterglow (Crowded House album)|Afterglow]]'', which included the track "Recurring Dream", recorded when the group were still called The Mullanes and included Craig Hooper on guitar.<ref name="McF"/> The album's liner notes included information about the songs, written by music journalist [[David Hepworth]]. Some limited-release versions included a second CD with songwriting commentary by Finn. The liner notes confirmed that Crowded House had no plans to reunite at that time.<ref name="McF"/> A 2003 compilation album, ''[[Classic Masters (Crowded House album)|Classic Masters]]'', was released only in the US, while 2005 saw the release of the album ''[[She Will Have Her Way]]'', a collection of cover versions of Crowded House, Split Enz, Tim Finn and Finn Brothers songs by Australasian female artists. The album reached the top 5 in Australia and New Zealand.<ref>[http://charts.org.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=&titel=She+Will+Have+Her+Way+%2D+The+Songs+Of+Tim+%26+Neil+Finn&cat=a "She Will Have Her Way – The Songs Of Tim & Neil Finn (Album)"] ''charts.org.nz''</ref>

On 26 March 2005 Paul Hester was found dead, after hanging himself from a tree in a park near his home in Melbourne. He was 46&nbsp;years old. His obituary in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' stated that he had fought "a long battle with depression."<ref name=hessie /> Following the news of Hester's death, Nick Seymour joined The Finn Brothers on stage at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, where the three played in memory of Paul.

{{Main|Time on Earth|Matt Sherrod}}
[[File:Matt Sherrod Crowded House Dublin 220607.jpg|thumb|right|Matt Sherrod, Dublin, 2007.]]In 2006 Neil Finn asked Nick Seymour to play bass on his third solo album. Seymour agreed and the two joined up with producer and multi-instrumentalist [[Ethan Johns]] to begin recording.<ref name="Howl"/> As the recording sessions progressed it was decided that the album would be issued under the Crowded House band name, rather than as a Neil Finn solo album. In January 2007, the group publicly announced their reformation and on 23 February, after 20&nbsp;days of auditions, former [[Beck]] drummer Matt Sherrod joined Finn, Seymour and Mark Hart to complete the new line up.<ref name="Howl"/> As Sherrod and Hart had not participated in the initial sessions, four new tracks were recorded with producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] including the album's first single "[[Don't Stop Now]]".<ref name="Howl"/>

On 17 March 2007 the band played a live show at their rehearsal studio in front of around fifty fans, friends and family. The performance was streamed live as a [[webcast]]. The two-and-a-half-hour set included some new tracks, including "Silent House" co-written by Finn with the [[Dixie Chicks]]. A concert onboard ''[[The Thekla]]'', moored in [[Bristol]], followed on 19 March.

[[File:NickSeymour2007.jpg|thumb|left|Nick Seymour, Barcelona, October 2007.]]Crowded House began recording their follow-up to ''Time on Earth'' in April 2009, at Finn's own [[Roundhead Studios]]. The album, ''[[Intriguer]]'', was produced by [[Jim Scott (producer)|Jim Scott]] who had worked on ''[[The Sun Came Out]]'' by Neil's 7 Worlds Collide project. In August 2009, Finn travelled to Los Angeles to record some overdubs at Jim Scott's Los Angeles studio before they began mixing tracks. The album was released in June 2010, in time for the band's appearance at the [[West Coast Blues & Roots Festival]] near [[Perth, Western Australia]]. Finn stated that the album contains some, "Unexpected twists and turns" and some songs that, "Sound like nothing we've done before."<ref>Thompson, Jody [http://www.spinnermusic.co.uk/2010/04/21/crowded-house-new-album-intriguer/ "Crowded House Return With New Album Intriguer"] spinnermusic.co.uk – 21 April 2010</ref> ''Intriguer'' topped the Australian album chart,<ref name="AusCharts"/> reached number 3 in New Zealand<ref name="NZCharts"/> and number 12 in the UK.<ref name="UKCharts"/>

Crowded House undertook an extensive world tour in 2010 in support of ''Intriguer''. This was the first album where the band regularly interacted with fans via the internet on their own re-launched website, Twitter and Facebook. The band sold recordings of the shows on the ''Intriguer'' tour on USB [[flash drives]] and made individual live tracks available for free download.

A new compilation album, [[The Very Very Best of Crowded House]], was released in October 2010 to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crowded-houses-top-hits-and-fan-favorites-gathered-for-the-very-very-best-of-crowded-house-to-be-released-october-26-by-capitolemi-101974448.html "Crowded House's Top Hits and Fan Favorites Gathered for 'The Very Very Best Of Crowded House,' to be Released 26 October by Capitol/EMI"] [[PR Newswire]] – 1 September 2010</ref> It includes 19 of the band's greatest hits and is also available in a box set with a 25 track DVD of their music videos. A deluxe digital version, available for download only, has 32 tracks including a rare 1987 live recording of the band's version of the [[Hunters & Collectors]] song "[[Throw Your Arms Around Me]]".

===Songwriting and musical influences===
As the primary songwriter for the band, Neil Finn has always set the tone for the band's sound. Allmusic said that Finn, "Has consistently proven his knack for crafting high-quality songs that combine irresistible melodies with meticulous lyrical detail."<ref>Woodstra, Chris [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p76135|pure_url=yes}} "Neil Finn > Biography"] AllMusic</ref> Neil's brother Tim was an early and important musical influence. Neil first saw Tim play with Split Enz in 1972, he said, "That performance and those first songs made a lasting impression on me."<ref>[http://www.mushroommusic.com.au/songwriters/78/finn-neil "Neil Finn > Biography"] ''[[Mushroom Records|Mushroom Music Publishing]]''</ref> His mother was another significant musical influence, encouraging him to listen to a variety of genres, including [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]] and [[Māori music]]. She would play piano at family parties and encourage Neil and Tim to accompany her.

===Album covers, costumes and set design===
Bassist Nick Seymour, who is also an artist, designed or co-designed all of the band's album covers and interior artwork. He also designed some of the costumes worn by the group, notably those from the cover of the group's debut album ''Crowded House''. Seymour collaborated with Finn and Hester on the set design of some of their early music videos, including "Don't Dream It's Over" and "Better Be Home Soon". Since the band reunited, Seymour has again designed their album covers.<ref name=denton />

The majority of the covers for the band's singles were not designed by Seymour. The artwork for "Pineapple Head" was created by [[Reg Mombassa]] of [[Mental As Anything]]. For the first four albums Mombassa and [[Noel Crombie]], who had been the main designer of Split Enz's artwork, assisted Seymour in creating sets and costumes. For the ''Farewell to the World'' concerts Crombie designed the set, while Mombassa and Seymour designed promotional materials and artwork.<ref>Crowded House, ''Farewell to the World'' concert film end credits, released December 1996.</ref>
