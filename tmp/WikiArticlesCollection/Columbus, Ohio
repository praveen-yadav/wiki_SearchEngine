==History==

===Ohio Country===
[[File:Ohio Country en.png|thumb|left|Map of the Ohio Country between 1775–1794 depicting locations of battles and massacres surrounding the area that would eventually become Ohio.]]
The region where modern-day Columbus is found was once called the [[Ohio Country]],<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=eIJtFPirzr8C&dq "The testing grounds of modern empire: the making of colonial racial order in the American Ohio country and the South African Eastern Cape, 1770s–1850s"], Christoph Strobel. Peter Lang, 2008. ISBN 1-4331-0123-8, ISBN 978-1-4331-0123-6. p. 22</ref> under the control of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] through the Vice-royauté of [[New France]]. European traders flocked to the area, in the interests of the fur trade.<ref>[http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=6&chapter=2 "Chapter One: The Anglo-French Contest for the Ohio Country"], Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. Retrieved September 10, 2010.</ref>

The area was consistently caught between warring factions, including Native American and European interests. In the 1740s Pennsylvania traders had overrun the territory until the French forcibly evicted them.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=jfxdH5pslt4C&pg "The ambiguous Iroquois empire: the Covenant Chain confederation of Indian tribes with English colonies from its beginnings to the Lancaster Treaty of 1744"], Francis Jennings. W. W. Norton & Company, 1990. ISBN 0-393-30302-0, ISBN 978-0-393-30302-5. p. 351.</ref> In the early 1750s [[George Washington]] was sent to the Ohio Country by the Ohio Company to survey, and the fight for control of the territory would spark Europe's [[Seven Years' War]] with the [[French and Indian War]].

The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded the country to the [[British Empire]] in 1763. During this period the country was routinely engaged in turmoil, with massacres and battles occurring.

===Virginia Military District===
Following the [[American Revolution]], the Ohio Country became part of the [[Virginia Military District]] under the control of the United States. Colonialists from the East Coast moved in, but rather than finding an empty [[frontier]], they encountered people of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Mingo]] nations, as well as European traders. The tribes resisted expansion by the fledgling United States, resulting in years of bitter conflict. The decisive [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] resulted in the [[Treaty of Greenville]], which finally opened the way for new settlements. By 1797, a young [[surveying|surveyor]] from [[Virginia]] named Lucas Sullivant had founded a permanent settlement on the west bank of the forks of the Scioto River. An admirer of [[Benjamin Franklin]], Sullivant chose to name his [[frontier]] village "[[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]]".<ref>Lentz, p. 33</ref> Although the location was desirable in its proximity to [[Navigability|navigable]] rivers, Sullivant was initially foiled when, in 1798, a large [[flood]] wiped out the newly formed settlement.<ref>Moore, p. 101</ref> He persevered, and the village was rebuilt.

===19th century===
[[File:Old Columbus City Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Old City Hall, completed in 1872 and burned in 1921]]
After Ohio achieved statehood in 1803, political infighting among Ohio's more prominent leaders resulted in the state capital moving from [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]] to [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]] and back again. The state legislature finally decided that a new capital city, located in the center of the state, was a necessary compromise. Columbus was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access by way of major transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio's capital over a number of other competitors, including Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware. Prior to the state legislature's decision in 1812, Columbus did not exist. The city was designed from the first as the state's capital, preparing itself for its role in Ohio's political, economic, and social life. Named in honor of Christopher Columbus, the capital city was founded on February 14, 1812, on the "High Banks opposite Franklinton at the Forks of the Scioto known as Wolf's Ridge."<ref>Lentz, pp. 41–43</ref> At the time, this area was a dense forestland, used only as a hunting ground.<ref>Moore, p. 122</ref>

The "Burough of Columbus" {{sic}} was officially established on February 10, 1816.<ref>Moore, pp. 135–136</ref> Nine people were elected to fill the various positions of Mayor, Treasurer, and others. Although the recent [[War of 1812]] had brought prosperity to the area, the subsequent recession and conflicting claims to the land threatened the success of the new town. Early conditions were abysmal with frequent bouts of fevers and an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1833.<ref>Moore, pp. 138–140</ref>

The [[National Road]] reached Columbus from [[Baltimore]] in 1831, which complemented the city's new link to the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] and facilitated a population boom.<ref>Lentz, p. 58</ref> A wave of immigrants from Europe resulted in the establishment of two ethnic [[enclave]]s on the outskirts of the city. A significant Irish population settled in the north along Naghten Street (presently Nationwide Boulevard), while the [[Germans]] took advantage of the cheap land to the south, creating a community that came to be known as ''[[German Village|Das Alte Südende]]'' (The Old South End). Columbus's German population constructed numerous breweries, [[Trinity Lutheran Seminary]], and [[Capital University]].<ref name = "zuahxa">Lentz, pp. 63–64</ref>
[[File:CbusGrtSthrn.JPG|thumb|left|The Great Southern Hotel, downtown, completed in 1897]]
With a population of 3500, Columbus was officially chartered as a city on March 3, 1834. The legislature carried out a [[Private bill|special act]] on that day, which granted legislative authority to the [[city council]] and judicial authority to the mayor. Elections were held in April of that year, with voters choosing one John Brooks as the first mayor.<ref>Moore, p. 156</ref> Columbus annexed the separate city of [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]] in 1837.<ref name="test">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HQ-DgBzxfx4C&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=columbus+annexed+franklinton&source=bl&ots=WVHus9r9MD&sig=SiC2xZXv0Rnl-ZuhLI0D9Zw7NCI&hl=en&ei=JDgFTePXKISglAe2yMzlCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=columbus%20annexed%20franklinton&f=false |title=Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=April 26, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2013}}</ref>

In 1850 the [[Columbus and Xenia Railroad]] became the first railroad to enter the city, followed by the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]] in 1851. The two railroads built a joint [[Union Station (Columbus)|Union Station]] on the east side of High Street just north of Naghten (then called North Public Lane). Rail traffic into Columbus increased—by 1875 Columbus was served by eight railroads, and a new, more elaborate station was built.<ref>

On January 7, 1857, the [[Ohio Statehouse]] finally opened to the public after 18 years of construction.<ref>Lentz, pp. 70–71</ref>

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Columbus was a major base for the volunteer [[Union Army]] that housed 26,000 troops and held up to 9,000 [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[prisoners of war]] at [[Camp Chase]] located at what is now the Hilltop neighborhood of west Columbus. Over 2,000 Confederate soldiers remain buried at the site, making it one of the largest Confederate cemeteries in the North.<ref>Lentz, p. 78</ref> North of Columbus, along the Delaware Road, the [[Regular Army]] established [[Camp Thomas (Ohio)|Camp Thomas]], where the [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th U.S. Infantry]] was organized and trained.

By virtue of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], the [[Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College]] (which became [[The Ohio State University]]) was founded in 1870 on the former estate of [[Victorian Village#Neil family|William and Hannah Neil]].<ref>Lentz, p.57</ref>
[[File:Waterford Tower in front of Miranova Condominiums.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Waterford Tower, shadowed by the [[Miranova Place|Miranova Condominiums]] in downtown Columbus]]
By the end of the 19th century, Columbus saw the rise of several major manufacturing businesses. The city became known as the "Buggy Capital of the World", thanks to the presence of some two dozen [[Carriage|buggy]] factories, notably the Columbus Buggy Company, which was founded in 1875 by C.D. Firestone. The Columbus Consolidated Brewing Company also rose to prominence during this time, and it may have had achieved even greater success were it not for the influence of the [[Anti-Saloon League]], based in neighboring [[Westerville, Ohio|Westerville]].<ref>Lentz, pp. 85–87</ref> In the [[steel|steel industry]], a forward-thinking man named [[Samuel P. Bush]] presided over the [[Buckeye Steel Castings]] Company. Columbus was also a popular location for the organization of labor. In 1886, [[Samuel Gompers]] founded the [[American Federation of Labor]] in Druid's Hall on S. Fourth Street, and in 1890 the [[United Mine Workers of America]] was founded at old City Hall.<ref>Lentz, pp. 91–92</ref> In 1894, [[James Thurber]], who would go on to an illustrious literary career in Paris and New York City, was born in the city. Today the Ohio State's theater department has a performance center named in his honor, and his youthful home near the Discovery District is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

"The Columbus Experiment" was an internationally recognized environmental project in 1908, which saw the construction of the first water plant in the world to apply filtration and softening, designed and invented by Hoover brothers, Clarence and Charles. Those working to construct the project included [[Flytown#O'Shaughnessy family|Jeremiah O'Shaughnessy]], name-bearer of the Columbus metropolitan area's [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (Ohio)|O'Shaughnessy Dam]]. This invention helped drastically reduce [[typhus]] deaths. These designs are still in use today.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070430015442/http://utilities.columbus.gov/About_Us/WaterTreatmentProcess.htm "General Water Treatment Process", Department of Public Utilities, City of Columbus (2007).] Retrieved July 3, 2012</ref>

Columbus earned one of its nicknames, "The Arch City", because of the dozens of wooden arches that spanned High Street at the turn of the 20th century. The arches illuminated the thoroughfare and eventually became the means by which electric power was provided to the new [[Tram|streetcars]]. The arches were torn down and replaced with cluster lights in 1914, but were reconstructed from metal in the [[Short North]] district in 2002 for their unique historical interest.<ref>Lentz, pp. 94–95</ref>

On March 25, 1913, the [[Great Dayton Flood]] devastated the neighborhood of Franklinton, leaving over ninety people dead and thousands of West Side residents homeless. To prevent future flooding, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] recommended widening the Scioto River through downtown, constructing new bridges, and building a [[retaining wall]] along its banks. With the strength of the post-[[World War I]] economy, a construction boom occurred in the 1920s, resulting in a new [[Civic center]], the [[Ohio Theatre (Columbus)|Ohio Theatre]], the [[LeVeque Tower|American Insurance Union Citadel]], and, to the north, a massive new [[Ohio Stadium]].<ref>Lentz, pp. 112–113</ref> Although the [[National Football League|American Professional Football Association]] was founded in [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] in 1920, its head offices moved to Columbus in 1921 and remained in the city until 1941. In 1922, the association's name was changed to the [[National Football League]].<ref>{{cite web| title =NFL History  | publisher =CBS Sportsline.com  | url =http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1921-1930

The effects of the [[Great Depression]] were somewhat less severe in Columbus, as the city's diversified economy helped it fare marginally better than its [[Rust Belt]] neighbors. [[World War II]] brought a tremendous number of new jobs to the city, and with it another population surge. This time, the majority of new arrivals were migrants from the "extraordinarily depressed rural areas" of [[Appalachia]], who would soon account for more than a third of Columbus' rising population.<ref>Lentz, pp.116–118</ref> In 1948, the Town and Country Shopping Center opened in suburban [[Whitehall, Ohio|Whitehall]], and it is now regarded as one of the first modern shopping centers in the United States.<ref>Lentz, p. 122</ref>

The construction of the [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highway]] signaled the arrival of rapid suburb development in central Ohio. In order to protect the city's tax base from this suburbanization, Columbus adopted a policy of linking sewer and water hookups to [[annexation]] to the city.<ref>Lentz, p. 129</ref> By the early 1990s, Columbus had grown to become Ohio's largest city in both land area and in population.

Efforts to revitalize [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|downtown Columbus]] have had some success in recent decades,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} though like most major American cities, some architectural heritage was lost in the process. In the 1970s, landmarks such as [[Union Station (Columbus)|Union Station]] and the Neil House Hotel were razed to construct high-rise offices and big retail space. The [[National City Bank Building (Columbus)|National City Bank building]] was constructed in 1977, as well as the [[One Nationwide Plaza|Nationwide Plazas]] and other towers that sprouted during this period. The construction of the [[Greater Columbus Convention Center]] has brought major conventions and trade shows to the city. The Scioto Mile is a showcase park that is being developed along the riverfront, an area which has already seen the development of [[Miranova Place|Miranova Corporate Center]] and [[The Condominiums at North Bank Park]]. Corporate interests have developed [[Capitol Square]], including the [[WCMH-TV|local NBC affiliate]] locating at the corner of Broad and High.

The [[2010 United States foreclosure crisis]] has forced the city to purchase numerous foreclosed, vacant properties – either to renovate them or to demolish them – at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. As of February 2011, there are an unprecedented 6,117 vacant properties in Columbus, according to city officials.<ref name=foreclosures>{{cite news |title=City spends millions renovating, demolishing eyesore properties |author=Mark Ferenchik |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/02/26/vacant_homes.html?sid=101 |newspaper=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |date=February 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref>

In 1907, 14-year-old [[Cromwell Dixon]] built the "SkyCycle," a pedal-powered blimp, which he flew at Driving Park.<ref name=PCI>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050205141621/http://www.port-columbus.com/about/75anniv.asp "75 Years of Flight in Columbus"], Port Columbus International Airport.

In 1910, the world's first commercial cargo flight occurred when one of the Wright Brothers' exhibition pilots, Phillip Parmalee, flew two packages containing 88&nbsp;kilograms of silk from Dayton to Columbus in a [[Wright Model B]], a distance of {{convert|70|mi}}.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=fPLm9omt_YIC&pg=PA23&dq=first+commercial+flight,+columbus,+dayton&hl=en&ei=aPo8TIWvN8H58Aahg5ylCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=first%20commercial%20flight%2C%20columbus%2C%20dayton&f=false "History of Air Cargo and Airmail from the 18th Century"], Camille Allaz. 2005.

Less than 20 years later, Port Columbus Airport became the axis of a coordinated rail-to-air transcontinental system that moved passengers from the East Coast to the West, with TAT, which later became TWA, providing the commercial service, following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s promotion of Columbus to the nation for such a hub. Following the failure of a bond levy in 1927 to build the airport, Lindbergh personally campaigned in the city in 1928, and the next bond levy passed that year.<ref name=PCI /> On July 8, 1929 the airport opened for business with the inaugural TAT west-bound flight from Columbus to Waynoka, Oklahoma. Among the 19 passengers on that flight was [[Amelia Earhart]],<ref name=PCI /> with [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harvey Firestone]] attending the opening ceremonies.<ref name=PCI />

In 1964, Ohio native [[Jerrie Mock|Geraldine Fredritz Mock]] became the first woman to fly around the world, leaving from Columbus and piloting the ''Spirit of Columbus''. Her flight lasted nearly a month, and set a record for speed for planes under 3858 pounds.<ref>[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2731 Geraldine Fredritz Mock] at Ohio History Central</ref>

[[File:Columbus ohio.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph showing some of Columbus, Ohio taken from the [[International Space Station]]]]
The confluence of the [[Scioto River|Scioto]] and [[Olentangy River|Olentangy]] rivers occurs just west of downtown Columbus. Several smaller tributaries course through the Columbus metro area, including [[Alum Creek]], [[Big Walnut Creek]], and [[Big Darby Creek|Darby Creek]]. Columbus is considered to have relatively flat [[topography]] thanks to a large [[glacier]] that covered most of Ohio during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin Ice Age]]. However, there are sizable differences in elevation through the area, with the high point of Franklin County being {{convert|1132|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] near [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]], and the low point being {{convert|670|ft|m|abbr=on}} where the Scioto River leaves the county near [[Lockbourne, Ohio|Lockbourne]].<ref name="fracomap">{{Cite journal

}}</ref> Numerous ravine areas near the rivers and creeks also help give some variety to the landscape. Tributaries to Alum Creek and the Olentangy River cut through shale, while tributaries to the Scioto River cut through limestone.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|223.11|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|217.17|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|5.94|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name ="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref>

===Climate===
The region's climate is transitional between [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') and the [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (Köppen ''Cfa''), characterized by hot, muggy summers and cold, dry winters. Winter snowfall is relatively light, since the city is not in the typical path of strong winter lows, such as the [[Nor'easters]] that strike cities farther east. It is also too far south and west for [[lake-effect snow]] from [[Lake Erie]] to have much effect, although the lakes to the North do contribute to long stretches of cloudy spells in winter.

The hottest temperature ever recorded in Columbus was {{convert|106|F|0}}, which occurred twice during the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s—once on July 21, 1934, and again on July 14, 1936.<ref name="National Weather Service">[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/iln/cmhrec.htm Records for Columbus.] [[National Weather Service]]. Retrieved on 2008-11-16.</ref> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-22|F|0}}, occurring on January 19, 1994.<ref name="National Weather Service" />
Columbus is subject to [[severe weather]] typical to the [[Midwestern United States]].  Severe thunderstorms can bring frequent lightning, large hail and [[Tornado]]es, especially during the spring and sometimes through fall, a recent one of which occurred on October 11, 2006 and caused [[Fujita Scale|F2]] damage.<ref>{{Cite news

The city is administered by a mayor and a seven-member unicameral council elected in two classes every two years to four-year terms. The mayor appoints the director of safety and the director of public service. The people elect the [[auditor]], [[court clerk|municipal court clerk]], [[judge|municipal court judges]] and [[city attorney]]. A charter commission, elected in 1913, submitted, in May 1914, a new charter offering a modified Federal form, with a number of progressive features, such as nonpartisan ballot, [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]], recall of [[official|elected officials]], the referendum, and a small council elected at large. The charter was adopted, effective January 1, 1916. The current mayor of Columbus is [[Michael B.

{{Main|Economy of Columbus}}
[[File:OPERS Building, Columbus, OH.jpg|thumb|left|OPERS building, downtown]]

Columbus has a generally strong and diverse economy based on education, insurance, banking, fashion, defense, aviation, food, logistics, steel, energy, medical research, health care, hospitality, retail, and technology. Overall, it was ranked as one of the top 10 best big cities in the country in 2010, according to Relocate America, a real estate research firm.<ref name=CBJ>[http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2010/04/19/daily28.html "Ranking: Columbus among top 10 big cities"], BizJournals.

[[File:State Teachers Retirement System Columbus.jpg|thumb|SERS building, downtown]]
During the [[Late-2000s recession|recession beginning in late 2007]], Columbus' economy was not impacted as much as the rest of the country, due to decades of diversification work by long-time corporate residents, business leaders, and political leaders. The current administration of mayor [[Michael B. Coleman]] has continued this work, although the city faced financial turmoil and had to increase taxes, due in part to alleged fiscal mismanagement.<ref>[http://thisweeknews.com/live/content/politics/LIVE_results/2009races/11/columbus_council.html?sid=104 "Recount Still Possible"], This Week Community Papers, Retrieved November 13, 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/local/local_govtpolitics/article/the_final_push_for_issue_one/19305/ NBC 4, Columbus Budget Shortfall, Tax Increase] Retrieved July 26, 2009.</ref> As Columbus is the state capital, there is a large government presence in the city. Including city, county, state, and federal employers, [[USAJOBS|government jobs]] provide the largest single source of employment within Columbus.

In 2013, the city had four corporations named to the U.S. Fortune 500 list including [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company]], [[American Electric Power]], [[L Brands]], and [[Big Lots]],<ref name="Fortune 500"/> with [[Cardinal Health]] located in suburban [[Dublin, Ohio|Dublin]].<ref name=GDP /> Other major employers in the area include numerous schools (for example, The Ohio State University) and hospitals, hi-tech research and development including the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], information/library companies such as [[OCLC]] and [[Chemical Abstracts]], financial institutions such as [[JP Morgan Chase]] and [[Huntington Bancshares]], as well as [[Owens Corning]] and [[Wendy's]]. Major foreign corporations operating or with divisions in the city include Germany-based [[Siemens]] and [[Boehringer Ingelheim|Roxane Laboratories]], Finland-based [[Vaisala]], Japan-based Techneglas, Inc. (Techneglas closed operations in Columbus), Tomasco Mulciber Inc., A Y Manufacturing, as well as [[Switzerland]]-based [[ABB Group]] and Mettler Toledo.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Transportation==
[[File:Columbus Skywalk 5.JPG|thumb|left|Columbus has numerous pedestrian skywalks linking together downtown buildings.]]

===Grid and address system===
The city's street plan originates downtown and extends into the old-growth neighborhoods, following a [[grid plan|grid pattern]] with the intersection of [[High Street]] (running north–south) and Broad Street (running east–west) at its center. North-South streets run 12 degrees west of due North, parallel to High Street; the Avenues (vis. Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and so on.) run east–west.<ref>Moore, p. 127</ref> The address system begins its numbering at the intersection of Broad and High, with numbers increasing in magnitude with distance from Broad or High. Numbered Avenues begin with First Avenue, about {{convert|1.25|mi|abbr=on}} north of Broad Street, and increase in number as one progresses northward. Numbered Streets begin with Second Street, which is two blocks west of High Street, and Third Street, which is a block east of High Street, then progress eastward from there. Even-numbered addresses are on the north and east sides of streets, putting odd addresses on the south and west sides of streets. A difference of 700 house numbers means a distance of about {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} (along the same street).<ref name="fracomap" /> For example, 351 W 5th Avenue is approximately {{convert|.5|mi|abbr=on}} west of High Street on the south side of Fifth Avenue. Buildings along north–south streets are numbered in a similar manner: the building number indicates the approximate distance from Broad Street, the prefixes ‘N’ and ‘S’ indicate whether that distance is to measured to the north or south of Broad Street and the street number itself indicates how far the street is from the center of the city at the intersection of Broad and High.

[[File:Columbus Numbered Streets and Avenues.png|thumb|Locations of numbered streets and avenues]]
This street numbering system does not hold true over a large area. The area served by numbered Avenues runs from about Marble Cliff to South Linden to the Airport, and the area served by numbered Streets covers Downtown and nearby neighborhoods to the east and south, with only a few exceptions. There are quite few intersections between numbered Streets and Avenues. Furthermore, named Streets and Avenues can have any orientation. For example, while all of the numbered avenues run east–west, perpendicular to High Street, many named, non-numbered avenues run north–south, parallel to High. The same is true of many named streets: while the numbered streets in the city run north–south, perpendicular to Broad Street, many named, non-numbered streets run east–west, perpendicular to High Street.

The addressing system, however, covers nearly all of Franklin County, with only a few older suburbs retaining self-centered address systems. The address scale of 700 per mile results in addresses approaching, but not usually reaching, 10,000 at the county's borders.

Other major, local roads in Columbus include Main Street, Morse Road, Dublin-Granville Road ([[Ohio State Route 161|SR-161]]), Cleveland Avenue/Westerville Road ([[Ohio State Highway 3|SR-3]]), Olentangy River Road, Riverside Drive, Sunbury Road, Fifth Avenue and Livingston Avenue.

===Highways===
Columbus is bisected by two major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]], [[Interstate 70]] running east–west, and [[Interstate 71]] running north to roughly southwest. The two Interstates combine downtown for about {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} in an area locally known as "The Split", which is a major [[traffic congestion]] point within Columbus, especially during [[rush hour]]. [[U.S. Highway 40]], aka [[National Road]], runs east–west through Columbus, comprising Main Street to the east of downtown and Broad Street to the west. It is also widely recognized as the nation's first highway. [[U.S. Highway 23]] runs roughly north–south, while [[U.S. Highway 33]] runs northwest-to-southeast. The [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] [[Beltway|Outerbelt]] encircles the vast majority of the city, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of the [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|Interstate 670]] spur on the north side (which continues to the east past the Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70), [[Ohio State Highway 315|State Route 315]] on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side, and I-71 on the east. Due to its central location within Ohio and abundance of outbound roadways, nearly all of the state's destinations are within a 2-hour drive of Columbus.

===Bridges===
The Columbus riverfront hosts a few notable bridges which have been built in recent years. The {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Main Street Bridge (Columbus)|Main Street Bridge]] opened on July 30, 2010 and is the first bridge of its kind in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downtowncolumbus.com/progress/main-street-bridge |title=Main Street Bridge: Steel Structure Makes Dramatic Visual Impact on Downtown Columbus Skyline |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |work=Downtown Columbus | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106135608/http://www.downtowncolumbus.com/progress/main-street-bridge | archivedate = January 6, 2009}}</ref> The bridge is located directly south of COSI on the Scioto river, featuring three lanes of traffic (one westbound and two eastbound) and another separated lane for pedestrians and bikes.

===Airports===
[[File:PCI CIMG9956.jpg|thumb|[[Port Columbus International Airport]]]]
The city's primary airport, [[Port Columbus International Airport]], is located on the east side of the city, with several smaller airports in the region as well. Port Columbus provides service to [[Toronto, Canada]] and [[Cancun, Mexico]] (on a seasonal basis), as well as to most domestic destinations, including all the major hubs except [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]], and [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Seattle]]. Port Columbus was a hub for [[Low-cost carrier|discount carrier]] [[Skybus Airlines]] and continues to be a home to [[NetJets]], the world's largest [[fractional ownership]] air carrier. According to a 2005 market survey, Port Columbus International Airport attracts about 50% of its passengers from outside of its {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} radius primary service region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://columbusairports.com/files/about-us/craa-eia-full-brochure1.pdf|title=Regional Airports economic impact study, Wilbur Smith Associates, Inc., January 2005, Chap 1 pp2-4|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref> Port Columbus is currently the 52nd-busiest airport in the United States by total passenger boardings.<ref>[[Columbus Dispatch]], February 26, 2012: "Can't get there from here (At least, not without a layover"), pp. D1-2 (By Steve Wartenberg)</ref> [[Rickenbacker International Airport]], in southern Franklin County, is a major cargo facility and is utilized by the Ohio [[Air National Guard]]. [[Allegiant Air]] offers twice weekly nonstop service from Rickenbacker to [[Orlando Sanford International Airport]] and [[St. Petersburg–Clearwater International Airport]]. [[Ohio State University Airport|OSU Don Scott Airport]] and [[Bolton Field]] are significant general-aviation facilities in the Columbus area.

===Rail===
Currently, Columbus does not have any type of passenger rail service.

Columbus used to have a major train station downtown called [[Union Station (Columbus)|Union Station]], most notably as a stop along [[Amtrak]]'s [[National Limited]] train service until 1977. The station itself was razed in 1979,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.columbus.rr.com/unionstation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028014238/http://home.columbus.rr.com/unionstation|archivedate=October 28, 2006|title=Columbus Union Station|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref> and the [[Greater Columbus Convention Center]] now stands in its place. The station was also a stop along the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]] and the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]]. Columbus is now the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|largest metropolitan area]] in the U.S. without either a local rail or intercity rail connection (Phoenix opened a [[light rail|light-rail]] system in 2008, but still lacks an [[Amtrak]] connection.  Other metro areas larger than Columbus also lack local rail systems.);<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm|title=Metropolitan Areas Served by Amtrak|date=November 23, 2006|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081227/ts_nm/us_transportation_phoenix|title=Phoenix debuts light-rail system|date=December 27, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref> however studies are underway towards reintroducing passenger rail service to Columbus via the [[Ohio Hub]] project. Plans are in the works to open a high-speed rail service connecting Columbus with Cincinnati and to the proposed hub in Cleveland which offers rail service to the East Coast, including New York and Washington, DC.<ref>[http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2009/07/18/RAILPLAN.ART_ART_07-18-09_B1_01EGPQ5.html?sid=101#Scene_1 Columbus Dispatch, High Speed Rail] Retrieved July 26, 2009.</ref>

===Bus===
Columbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called the [[Central Ohio Transit Authority]] (COTA).

===Bicycle===
Bicycling as transportation is steadily increasing in Columbus with its relatively flat terrain, intact urban neighborhoods, large student population, and off-road bike paths. The city has put forth the [http://publicservice.columbus.gov/content.aspx?id=30674 2012 Bicentennial Bikeways Plan] as well as a move toward a Complete Streets policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altaprojects.net/columbus/ |title=Columbus (OH) Bikeways Plan |publisher=Altaprojects.net |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}</ref> Grassroots efforts such as Bike To Work Week, Consider Biking, Yay Bikes,<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Reed |url=http://yaybikes.com/about-us/ |title=About Us &#124; Yay Bikes! &#124; Columbus, Oh |publisher=Yay Bikes! |date= |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref> Third Hand Bicycle Co-op, Franklinton Cycleworks, and ''Cranksters'', a local radio program focused on urban cycling,<ref>{{cite web|author=WCRS LP Columbus Community Radio |url=http://wcrsfm.org/cranksters |title=Cranksters &#124; WCRS LP Columbus Community Radio |publisher=Wcrsfm.org |date=November 15, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}</ref> have contributed to cycling as transportation.

Columbus also hosts [[Utility cycling|urban cycling]] "off-shots" with messenger-style "alleycat" races as well as unorganized group rides, a monthly [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] ride,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comacrew.homestead.com/criticalmass.html |title=Critical Mass Columbus |publisher=Comacrew.homestead.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}</ref> [[Cycle polo|bicycle polo]], art showings, movie nights, and a variety of [[bicycle-friendly]] businesses and events throughout the year. All this activity occurs despite Columbus's frequently inclement weather.

The new [[Main Street Bridge (Columbus)|Main Street Bridge]] features a dedicated bike and pedestrian lane separated from traffic, as will the Rich Street Bridge when it opens in 2011.

Some sources claim that the first [[kindergarten]] in the United States was established here by Louisa Frankenberg, a former student of [[Friedrich Fröbel]].<ref name = "zuahxa"/> Frankenberg immigrated to the city in 1838. In addition, [[Indianola Junior High School]] became the nation's first [[junior high]] in 1909, helping to bridge the difficult transition from

===Landmarks===
Columbus is home to several notable buildings, including the Greek Revival [[List of state capitols in the United States|State Capitol]], the [[Art Deco|art-deco]] Ohio Judicial Center and the [[Peter Eisenman]]-designed [[Wexner Center]] and [[Greater Columbus Convention Center]]. Other buildings of interest include the [[Rhodes State Office Tower]], [[LeVeque Tower]], and [[One Nationwide Plaza]].

The [[Ohio Statehouse]] construction began in 1839 on a 10&nbsp;acre (40,000-m²) plot of land donated by four prominent Columbus landowners. This plot formed Capitol Square, which was not part of the original layout of the city. Built of Columbus [[limestone]] from the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]], the Statehouse stands on foundations {{convert|18|ft|m}} deep, laid by [[prison labor]] gangs rumored to have been composed largely of [[masonry|masons]] jailed for minor infractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/pages/capitol_square/statehouse.cfm?submenu=statehouse|title=Ohio Statehouse Facts|date=December 13, 2006}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> The Statehouse features a central recessed [[porch]] with a [[colonnade]] of a forthright and primitive [[Doric order|Greek Doric mode]]. A broad and low central pediment supports the windowed [[astylar]] drum under an invisibly low [[dome|saucer dome]] that lights the interior [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]. Unlike many U.S. state capitol buildings, the Ohio State Capitol owes little to the architecture of the [[United States Capitol|national Capitol]]. During the long course of the Statehouse's 22&nbsp;years of construction, seven architects were employed. Relations between the legislature and the architects were not always cordial: Nathan B. Kelly, who introduced heating and an ingenious system of natural forced ventilation, was dismissed because the commissioners found his designs too lavish for the original intentions of the committee. The Statehouse was opened to the legislature and the public in 1857 and finally completed in 1861. It is located at the intersection of Broad and High Streets in downtown Columbus.

Founded in 1975, The Jefferson Center for Learning and the Arts is a campus of nonprofit organizations and a center for research, publications, and seminars on nonprofit leadership and governance. Located at the eastern edge of downtown Columbus, The Jefferson Center has restored 11 turn-of-the-century homes, including the childhood residence of [[James Thurber]]. These locations are used for nonprofits in human services, education and the arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejeffersoncenter.org|title=The Jefferson Center|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref>

A to-scale replica of the [[Santa María (ship)|Santa Maria]] is found on the Scioto Riverfront. It was installed in 1992 to commemorate the 500-year anniversary of the [[Discoverer of the Americas|discovery of America]] by Columbus' [[Christopher Columbus|namesake]].

Within the [[Driving Park]] heritage district lies the original home of [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], the famous WWI [[fighter aircraft|fighter pilot]] ace. Reconstruction of the home is underway.

Established in 1848, [[Greenlawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio|Green Lawn Cemetery]] is one of the largest cemeteries in the Midwestern United States.
