'''Angela Vincent''' (born 1942) is a professor at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. She is the head of a research group, which is located in the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine and working on a wide range of [[biology|biological]] disciplines encompassing [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], cellular [[immunology]] and intracellular [[neurophysiology]]. The group's research is focused on autoimmune and [[genetic disorder]]s of the neuromuscular junction and peripheral motor nerves. The principal autoimmune diseases studied are [[myasthenia gravis]], the [[Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome]] and acquired [[neuromyotonia]]. 

Her contributions are mainly on the roles of antibodies directed against [[ion channel]] at the [[nerve]]-[[muscle]] junction in the pathogenesis of above mentioned diseases. She has demonstrated that transfer of these [[antibody|antibodies]] across the [[placenta]] from the [[pregnant]] [[woman]] to the [[fetus]] [[in utero]] can cause developmental abnormalities. She has also worked on the principal gene [[mutation]]s causing neuromuscular diseases.

In 2009 she presented the [[Leslie Oliver Oration]] at [[Queen's Hospital]].<ref>[http://www.bhrhospitals.nhs.uk/neuro/neuro4ha.php?id=1034 The Second Leslie Oliver Oration]</ref>
