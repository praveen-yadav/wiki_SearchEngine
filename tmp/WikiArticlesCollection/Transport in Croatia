'''Transport in Croatia''' relies on several main modes, including [[Transportation|transport]] by road, rail, water and air. Road transport incorporates a comprehensive network of state, county and local routes augmented by a network of highways for long-distance travelling. Water transport can be divided into sea, based on the ports of [[Rijeka]], [[Ploče]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Zadar]], and river transport, based on [[Sava]], [[Danube]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Drava]]. [[Croatia]] has 68 airports, five of which are international. The country also has several airlines, of which the most notable is [[Croatia Airlines]]. Rail transport is fairly developed, with dual track and electrification not very common, although high-speed tilting trains are used on some routes. However, bus still tends to be more common than rail as a mode of inter-city transport.

==Airports==
[[File:Croati Airlines A319.jpg|thumb|right|National carrier [[Croatia Airlines]] taking off at [[Zagreb Airport]] ]]
There are international [[airport]]s in [[Zagreb Airport|Zagreb]], [[Zadar Airport|Zadar]], [[Split Airport|Split]], [[Dubrovnik Airport|Dubrovnik]] and [[Rijeka Airport|Rijeka]] (on the island of [[Krk]]). Recently, [[Osijek Airport]] in [[Slavonia]] has been renovated for regional traffic. It is also being considered to revitalize the [[Pula Airport]] ([[Istria]]) as a destination for low cost airlines.

Currently, the following low cost airlines are flying to Croatia: [[EasyJet]], [[Flyglobespan]], [[Germanwings]], [[TUIfly]], [[Ryanair]], [[Thomson Airways|Thomson]] and [[Wizz Air]]. Major established companies that fly to Croatia include the domestic [[Croatia Airlines]] (member of the [[Star Alliance]]), [[Air France]], [[Lufthansa]] and [[British Airways]]. Seasonal intercontinental flights also operate from and to Croatia.

In January 2011 the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) assessed the Government of Croatia's Civil Aviation Authority announcing that Croatia complied with [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Croatia's air carrier operations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=12337 | title = FAA Raises Safety Rating for Croatia | publisher = Federal Aviation Administration | date = 2011-01-26 | accessdate = 2011-01-27}}</ref> This means that the country has an IASA Category 1 rating and that Croatian air carriers are authorized to establish direct flights from Croatia to the US.

{{see also|List of railways in Croatia|Croatian Railways}}

The Croatian railway network is classified into three groups: railways of international, regional and local significance.<ref name=NN81-2006>{{cite web|publisher=[[Government of Croatia]]|url=http://cadial.hidra.hr/searchdoc.php?query=&lang=hr&bid=nJbXVZkld1Kh4b1smwO6jA%3D%3D|title=Odluka o razvrstavanju željezničkih pruga|language=Croatian|trans_title=Decision on Classification of Railways|work=[[Narodne novine]]|issue=81|year=2006}}</ref><ref name=NN13-2007>{{cite web|publisher=[[Government of Croatia]]|url=http://cadial.hidra.hr/searchdoc.php?query=&lang=hr&annotate=on&bid=wj6f4ZQU2PzTf%2bZonMsbkg%3d%3d|title=Odluka o izmjeni i dopuni Odluke o razvrstavanju željezničkih pruga |language=Croatian|trans_title=Decision on changes and additions to the Decision on Classification of Railways|work=[[Narodne novine]]|issue=13|year=2007}}</ref> The most important railway lines follow [[Pan-European corridors]] V (branch B) and X, they connect at Zagreb with each other. There are connections to the railway networks of [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Serbia]].

The railways need to be modernized because since the disintegration of [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] there have been hardly any investment in railway infrastructure. Many important routes are not electrified and are only single track traffic around 'bends'. Some improvements have been made in the last ten years. A result of this has been an increase in the maximum speed on the railway line on the [[Pan-European Corridor X]], from the Slovenian border via Zagreb, Novska, Vinkovci to the Serbian border (lines [[M101 railway (Croatia)|M101]] through [[M105 railway (Croatia)|M105]]). In places the line's speed limit has been raised from {{convert|80|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on|sp=on}} to {{convert|120|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on|sp=on}}, and plans have been made to raise this further to {{convert|160|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on|sp=on}} on certain sections. The railway line of the [[Pan-European Corridor Vb]], from the Hungarian border via Koprivnica, Zagreb, Karlovac to the [[Port of Rijeka]] (lines [[M201 railway (Croatia)|M201]], [[M102 railway (Croatia)|M102]] and [[M202 railway (Croatia)|M202]]) has a slow section through [[Gorski Kotar]], which is planned to undergo a major overhaul. The railway line of the [[Pan-European Corridor Vc]], from the Hungarian border via Beli Manastir, Osijek, Đakovo or Vinkovci, Slavonski Šamac, to the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina (lines [[M301 railway (Croatia)|M301]], [[M302 railway (Croatia)|M302]] and [[M303 railway (Croatia)|M303]]), is also being modernised, the aim is to allow speeds of up to 160&nbsp;km/h along the entire length.

The official rail speed record in Croatia is {{convert|181|km/h|abbr=on}}. Maximum speed reached in regular service is {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}} on parts of the [[M105 railway (Croatia)|Novska–Tovarnik line]].

Recently [[Croatian Railways]] introduced a series of modern [[tilting train]]s produced by the German branch of [[Bombardier Transportation]]. They usually deployed on the mountainous route between the two largest Croatian cities, [[Zagreb]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. Although they can sometimes be found on [[InterCity]] routes in the continental part of the country. The trains on the Zagreb–Split route (lines [[M202 railway (Croatia)|M202]] and [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604]]) offer passengers a more comfortable and quicker journey. The previous service used to take 9 hours, whereas the tilting trains take no more than 5.5 hours. There are plans to expand the [[tilting train]] service since they turned out to be very profitable on longer routes.

Croatian Railways aims to revitalize rail traffic through further improvements. Thus, establishing rail as serious competitor to the car, particularly during the busy the summer months.

Croatian Railways' plan to build their first [[high-speed railway]] service is progressing. Construction of an entirely new line from [[Karlovac]] to [[Rijeka]], and reconstruction of the line from the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] border to Karlovac should have originally begun in the Fall of 2007. The line is going to be entirely electrified and in order to speed up the journey even more shall be {{convert|269|km|mi|0|sp=on|abbr=on}} long from end to end, {{convert|61|km|mi|0|sp=on|abbr=on}} shorter than the existing line. The journey from [[Zagreb]] to [[Rijeka]] will be cut to one hour compared to 4 hours with the existing track. The line is intended to carry the increasing amount of goods that enter Europe, at the Croatian [[Port of Rijeka]] and are then transported to destinations across central and [[eastern Europe]]. The plans have originally foreseen 2008-2010 as the date for completion. Due to the [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009|world economic crisis]], building start date is prolonged to an yet undefined date. The project plans have been drawn, however.

[[Pan-European Corridor X]] is going to be upgraded to higher speed sometime in the future. Possibly by building a new high capacity connection line from [[Sisak]] via [[Kutina]] to [[Lipovljani]]. The line should allow for speeds of up to 250&nbsp;km/h.

'''Statistics:'''

Railway length (as of 2006):
* total: {{convert|2726|km|mi|0|sp=on|abbr=on}}
* standard gauge, {{RailGauge|1435mm}}: {{convert|2726|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1199|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}} electrified)

== Road transport ==
[[File:Držićeva av. - pumpa.jpg|thumb|A [[gas station]] in [[Zagreb]]]]
From the time of [[Napoleon]] and building the [[Louisiana road (Croatia)|Louisiana road]], the road transport in Croatia has significantly improved, topping most European countries. Croatian [[highway]]s are widely regarded as being one of the most modern and safe in Europe.<ref name=openeurope>{{cite web

}}</ref> This is because the largest part of the Croatian motorway and expressway system (''autoceste'' and ''brze ceste'', resp.)  has been recently constructed, and further construction is continuing.

A major reason for the motorway construction "mania" of the 2000s is a previous political halt of the major Croatian highway project, today's A1, in the 1970s and 1980s under [[SFRY|former Yugoslavia]]. When Croatia declared independence in 1991, the only true motorways in the country were [[Zagreb]]&ndash;[[Karlovac]] (the northernmost part of [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]]) and Zagreb-[[Slavonski Brod]] ([[A3 (Croatia)|A3]]), the latter being part of the [[highway "Bratstvo i jedinstvo"]]. The dream to connect the two largest Croatian cities [[Zagreb]] and [[Split (city)|Split]] with a motorway (''autocesta'') went back to the times of the [[Croatian Spring]]. However, the construction of this project had been blocked by the ruling [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]]. Recently, after so many years of waiting, the construction of this route has been realized, in addition to the extension of the [[A3 (Croatia)|A3]] so it connects Zagreb to Croatian borders with both [[Serbia]] (near [[Lipovac, Vukovar-Syrmia County|Lipovac]]) and [[Slovenia]] (near [[Bregana]]). There is also a motorway from Zagreb to Rijeka, the  [[A6 (Croatia)|A6]], as well as the [[A4 (Croatia)|A4]] motorway from Zagreb to the northeast (Hungarian border) as well as a motorway from Zagreb to the northwest (Slovenian border), the [[A2 (Croatia)|A2]]. The [[A9 (Croatia)|A9]] between Pula and the Slovenian border is also largely completed.

As of 2011, the construction of various additional motorways is planned, such as the extension of the [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] from Split to Ploče and onwards to Dubrovnik, while the [[A8 (Croatia)|A8]] (Kanfanar-Rijeka, the remaining part of the [[Istrian Y]]) is being upgraded from ''[[semi-highway]]'' status. The other motorways are in various early stages of development, coming up to a total of 13 motorway routes.

The initial setup was made under the first [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] government which contracted [[Bechtel Corporation]]; this was later replaced by the effort of the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]-led government effort led by [[Radimir Čačić]]; and then continued by the HDZ government under [[Ivo Sanader]].
While the pace of development accelerates, so do [[environmentalism|environmental]] concerns, and concerns relating to the use and abuse of [[eminent domain]] by institutions involved in them.
Especially criticized was the A11 Zagreb-Sisak, suspected  of being politically motivated and inefficiently built.
At the contrary, Zagreb-Split trait construction enjoyed a constant support from Croatian public and its on-schedule  completion was marked with enormous joy and pride all through the country.

[[Tourism]] is of major importance for the Croatian economy, and most tourists come to vacation in Croatia in their own cars. Without adequate roads, the traffic would get rather jammed during the summer months. For this reason, and as a means for stimulating urgently needed economic growth, highways have become indispensable for the sustainable development of this country. Croatia already has a considerable highway density for a country that still has to cope with the consequences of [[Communism]] and the [[war in Croatia|recent war]].

As of 2006, Croatia has {{convert|28344|km|sp=us}} of roads. Out of these, there are {{convert|23979|km|abbr=on}} of paved and {{convert|4365|km|abbr=on}} of unpaved roadways

===Traffic laws===
The [[traffic sign]]s adhere to the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]].

The general [[speed limit]]s are:
* in inhabited areas 50&nbsp;km/h
* outside of inhabited areas 90&nbsp;km/h
* on marked expressways 110&nbsp;km/h
* on marked motorways 130&nbsp;km/h

In 2004, a controversial new traffic law was introduced, which provides for drastic safety measures for drunken or dangerous driving: it reduced the blood alcohol limit to 0‰ of alcohol in blood. In 2008 this law was reversed to 0.05‰ of alcohol in blood.

Some of the more technical safety measures include that all new Croatian [[tunnel]]s have modern safety equipment and there are several control centers, which monitor highway traffic.

===Motorways===
{{main|Motorways in Croatia}}
Motorways ({{lang-hr|Autocesta}}, plural {{lang-hr|autoceste}})in Croatia applies to dual carriageway roads with at least two [[traffic lanes]] in each driving direction and an [[emergency lane]]. Direction [[road sign]]s at Croatian motorways have green background with white lettering similar to the Swiss [[Autobahn]]. The designations of motorways are "A" and the motorway number.

The list of completed motorways is as follows (see individual articles for further construction plans and status):

*'''[[A1 (Croatia)|A1]]''', [[Zagreb]] - [[Bosiljevo 2 interchange|Bosiljevo]] - [[Split (city)|Split]] - [[Vrgorac]] ([[European route E71|E71]], [[European route E65|E65]])
*'''[[A2 (Croatia)|A2]]''', [[Zagreb bypass|Zagreb]] - [[Krapina]] - [[Macelj]] ([[European route E59|E59]])
*'''[[A3 (Croatia)|A3]]''', [[Bregana]] - [[Zagreb bypass|Zagreb]] - [[Lipovac, Vukovar-Syrmia County|Lipovac]] ([[European route E70|E70]])
*'''[[A4 (Croatia)|A4]]''', [[Goričan]] - [[Varaždin]]/[[Čakovec]] - [[Zagreb bypass|Zagreb]] ([[European route E71|E71]])
*'''[[A5 (Croatia)|A5]]''', [[Osijek]] - [[Đakovo]] - [[Sredanci interchange|Sredanci]] ([[European route E73|E73]])
*'''[[A6 (Croatia)|A6]]''', [[Bosiljevo 2 interchange|Bosiljevo]] - [[Rijeka]] ([[European route E65|E65]])
*'''[[A7 (Croatia)|A7]]''', [[Rupa, Croatia|Rupa]] - [[Rijeka bypass]] ([[European route E61|E61]])
*'''[[A9 (Croatia)|A9]]''', [[Umag]] - [[Pula]] ([[European route E751|E751]])
*'''[[A11 (Croatia)|A11]]''', [[Velika Gorica]] - Buševec

Toll is charged on most [[Croatian motorways]], and exceptions are the A11 motorway, [[Zagreb bypass]] and [[Rijeka bypass]], as well as sections adjacent to border crossings (except eastbound A3). Payment in [[Croatian kuna|kuna]], all major credit cards and [[euro]]s are accepted at all toll gates. Most motorways are covered by the [[closed toll collection]] system, where a driver receives a ticket at the entrance gates and pays at the exit gates according to the number of sections travelled. [[Open toll collection]] is used on some bridges and tunnels and short stretches of tolled highway, where drivers immediately pay the toll upon arriving. Various forms of prepaid [[electronic toll collection]] systems are in place which allow quicker collection of toll, usually at a discounted rate, as well as use of dedicated toll plaza lanes (for ''ENC system'' of the electronic toll collection).

All heavily traveled routes towards [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Serbia]] are motorway connections, and almost all parts of Croatia are now easy to reach using motorways.

The 380&nbsp;km long motorway A1 [[Zagreb]] - [[Split (city)|Split]] connects the continental part of Croatia with Mediterranean [[Dalmatia]]. It is complete with two lanes in both directions in its full length. The highway winds itself as a panoramic road through the Croatian hills. The highway currently ends near the [[Ploče]] sea port, but is planned to continue further on to [[Dubrovnik]].

The most important edifice on the A1 is the [[Sveti Rok Tunnel]] (5.687&nbsp;m), which goes through the famous [[Velebit]] mountain range barrier. The most modern, and at the same time the longest Croatian tunnel, is also along the A1: the [[Mala Kapela Tunnel]] (length 5,780&nbsp;m), which passes through the [[Mala Kapela]] mountain range.

Since June 2005 the [[Istrian Y]] extends from the Slovenian border in [[Istria]] and the A7 connects Slovenia to [[Rijeka]]. The A2 connection between [[Zagreb]] via [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] to [[Maribor]] was completed in May 2007.

Motorway A3 extends from Slovenia via the [[Zagreb bypass]] through the length of [[Slavonia]] to the [[Serbia]]n border. In Slavonia there is now another motorway, A5, along the [[European route E73]] (European north-south corridor Vc) between the [[Hungary|Hungarian border]] at [[Beli Manastir]], [[Osijek]] and the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian border]]. This route will eventually continue as a modern motorway towards [[Sarajevo]] and further on to the Croatian sea port of [[Ploče]].

The A4 connection from Zagreb to [[Varaždin]] and [[Čakovec]] exists since 2003, which was extended to the Hungarian border in October 2008 to complete the upgrade of the [[European route E71]]. The A6 route between [[Rijeka]] and [[Zagreb]] was constructed as an expressway in spring 2004, and upgraded to a full motorway in October 2008, thus upgrading the Croatian section of the [[European route E65]]. Together these two upgrades completed the European north-south corridor Vb.

A motorway connection of [[Zagreb]] to the important industrial city of [[Sisak]] is planned to be constructed as [[A11 (Croatia)|A11]].

Significant tunnel and bridge construction projects in the south of Dalmatia are planned, such as the [[Biokovo]] tunnel near [[Makarska]], which will connect the panoramic seashore road with the future A1, and a {{convert|2374|m|ft|0|sp=on|abbr=on}} long [[Pelješac bridge]], connecting the [[Pelješac]] peninsula to the Croatian mainland.

By 2008, numerous service areas and petrol stations had been constructed along all Croatian motorways. All Croatian motorways are equipped with enclosed service areas with gas stations and parking. Many areas have restaurants and children's playgrounds.

===Expressways===
{{main|Expressways in Croatia}}
The term ''brza cesta'' or ''expressway'' refers to [[limited-access road]]s specifically designated as such by legislation and marked with appropriate [[limited-access road]] traffic signs. The expressways may comprise two or more traffic lanes, while they normally do not have emergency lanes.

''Polu-autocesta'' or ''[[semi-highway]]'' refers to a two-lane, undivided road running on one roadway of a motorway while the other is in construction. By legal definition, all semi-highways are expressways.

The expressway routes in Croatia usually correspond to a state road (see below) and are marked a "D" followed by a number. The "E" numbers are designations of [[European route]]s.

===Major roads===
{{Main|State roads in Croatia}}
Major roads that aren't part of the motorway system are ''državne ceste'' (state routes). They are marked with the letter D and the road's number.

The most traveled state routes in Croatia are:
* '''[[D1 (Croatia)|D1]]''', connects [[Zagreb]] and Split via [[Lika]] - passes through [[Karlovac]], [[Slunj]], [[Plitvička Jezera|Plitvice]], [[Korenica]], [[Knin]], [[Sinj]].
* '''[[D2 (Croatia)|D2]]''', connects [[Varaždin]] and [[Osijek]] via [[Podravina]] - passes through [[Koprivnica]], [[Virovitica]], [[Slatina, Croatia|Slatina]], [[Našice]].
* '''[[D8 (Croatia)|D8]]''', connects [[Rijeka]] and [[Dubrovnik]], widely known as ''[[Jadranska magistrala]]'' and part of [[European route E65|E65]] - runs along the coastline and connects many cities on the coast, including [[Crikvenica]], [[Senj]], [[Zadar]], [[Šibenik]], [[Trogir]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Omiš]], [[Makarska]] and [[Ploče]].

Since the construction of [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] motorway beyond [[Gorski kotar]] started, D1 and D8 are much less used.

These routes are monitored by Croatian roadside assistance because they connect important locations. Like all state routes outside major cities, they are only two-lane arterials and do not support heavy traffic. All state routes are routinely maintained by Croatian road authorities. The road sign for a state route has a blue background and the route's designation in white. State routes have one, two or three-digit numbers.

===Minor roads===
Secondary routes are known as county roads. They are marked with signs with yellow background and road number. These roads' designations are rarely used, but usually marked on regional maps if these roads are shown. Formally, their designation is the letter Ž and the number. County roads have four-digit numbers.

The least known are the so-called local roads. Their designations are never marked on maps or by roadside signs and as such are virtually unknown to public. Their designations consist of the letter L and a five-digit number.

=== Bus traffic ===
In contrast to the fairly underdeveloped rail traffic, [[bus]]es represent the most-accepted, cheapest and widely used means of public transport. National bus traffic is very well developed and it is very easy to reach even the remotest parts of Croatia by bus. Almost all buses on national routes are air-conditioned and offer pleasant traveling comfort. The Croatian parliament has passed a law that no bus should be older than 12 years - however, this decision is currently frozen because of the high cost for bus operators.

In practice, bus fares are collected on the bus while traveling, which is sometimes even cheaper than when paying at the ticket office (there is an additional fee for stored luggage) and sometimes a "ticket office fee".

From Croatia, there are many international bus routes to the neighboring countries ([[Slovenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]] etc.), as well as to Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Switzerland and to other European countries. International buses correspond to European standards.

[[Zagreb]] has the largest and most modern bus terminal in Croatia. It is located near the downtown in [[Trnje, Zagreb|Trnje]] district on the [[Marin Držić Avenue]]. It sports specially designed waiting areas above the bus stopping and parking area. The Zagreb bus terminal is close to the central train station, Glavni kolodvor and it is easy to reach by [[tram]] lines and by car.

==Water transport==

===Sea transport===
Croatia has several large [[seaport]]s. The largest seaport with the deepest channel to a port in the Adriatic is [[Port of Rijeka]] on the northern Croatian coast, followed by [[Ploče]] in southern Dalmatia. The port of Ploče is of strategic importance for the industries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The largest Croatian passenger port is [[Port of Split|Split]] in [[Dalmatia]], also called ''gateway to the islands'', followed by [[Zadar]]. There are 66 inhabited islands along the Croatian coast which means there is a large number of local ferry connections.

'''Ports and harbors:'''
* major transport seaports: [[Omišalj]], [[Port of Ploče|Ploče]], [[Port of Rijeka|Rijeka]], [[Šibenik]]
* other seaports: [[Dubrovnik]], [[Dugi Rat]], [[Pula, Croatia|Pula]], [[Port of Split|Split]], [[Zadar]]
* inland waterway ports: [[Vukovar]] (on [[Danube]]), [[Sisak]] (on [[Sava]]), [[Slavonski Brod]] ([[Sava]] river), [[Zupanja]] ([[Sava]] river), [[Osijek]] ([[Drava]] river)

[[Merchant marine]] (as of 2005):
* ''total:'' 73 ships ({{GRT|1,000|first=yes}} or over) totaling {{GRT|750,579}}/{{DWT|1,178,786|metric|first=yes}}
* ''ships by type:''
** [[bulk carrier]] 25

** [[oil tanker|petroleum tanker]] 4
** refrigerated cargo 1
** roll on/roll off 4
** foreign-owned ships registered here as a [[flag of convenience]]: 1
*** Denmark 1
** registered in other countries: 31

An extensive system of ferries, operated by [[Jadrolinija]], serves Croatia's many islands and links coastal cities. Ferry services to Italian cities of [[Venice]], [[Ancona]], [[Pescara]] and [[Bari]] from around a dozen of Croatian sea ports, most notably [[Rovinj]], [[Rijeka]], [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Korčula]] and [[Dubrovnik]], is available on a daily or weekly basis. From April to September the schedule is more dense and can include several round trips within a day.

===River transport===
Croatia is also on the important [[Danube]] waterway, which connects Eastern and Central Europe. The major Danube port is [[Vukovar]].

Perennially navigable rivers:
* [[Danube]] (section from Batina to Ilok which is in Croatia)
* [[Sava]] - from [[Rugvica]] until it exits Croatia near Gunja. The most upstream port is in [[Sisak]].
Total [[waterway]] length (as of 2004): 785&nbsp;km

== Pipelines ==
There are {{convert|610|km|abbr=off}} of crude oil pipelines in Croatia, connecting the Port of Rijeka oil terminal with refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, as well as several transhipment terminals. The system has a capacity of 20&nbsp;million tonnes per year.<ref name="JANAF-system">{{cite web|publisher=[[Jadranski naftovod]]|url=http://www.janaf.hr/index.php?option=sustav&lang=en|title=The JANAF system|accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> The natural gas transportation system comprises {{convert|2113|km|abbr=off}} of trunk and regional natural gas pipelines, and more than 300 associated structures, connecting production rigs, the [[Okoli]]{{disambiguation needed|date=June 2013}} natural gas storage facility, 27 end-users and 37 distribution systems.<ref name="Plinacro-system">{{cite web|publisher=[[Plinacro]]|url=http://www.plinacro.hr/default.aspx?id=264|title=Transportni sustav|trans_title=Transport system|language=Croatian|accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref>
