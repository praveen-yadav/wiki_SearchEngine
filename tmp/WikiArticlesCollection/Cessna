The '''Cessna Aircraft Company''' is an American [[general aviation]] aircraft manufacturing corporation headquartered in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Best known for small, piston-powered aircraft, Cessna also produces [[business jet]]s. The company is a subsidiary of the U.S. conglomerate [[Textron]].

==History==
* June 1911:  [[Clyde Cessna]], a farmer in Rago, [[Kansas]], built and flew his own aircraft, the first person to do so between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Cessna started his wood-and-fabric aircraft ventures in [[Enid, Oklahoma]], testing many of his early planes on the salt flats. When bankers in Enid refused to lend him more money to build his planes, he moved to [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]].<ref>[http://www.enidnews.com/localnews/local_story_025012803.html Article in "Enid News"]</ref>

* 1927: Cessna Aircraft was formed when Clyde Cessna and [[Victor Roos]] became partners in the Cessna-Roos Aircraft Company. Roos resigned just one month into the partnership selling back his interest to Cessna.<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Flying Magazine|date=April 1962|title=Cessna Single Engine Fleet}}</ref> In the same year, the [[Kansas Secretary of State]] approved dropping Roos's name from the company name.<ref>[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1927-1939.html History of Cessna 1927]</ref>

===Chinese production controversy===
On 27 November 2007 Cessna announced the new [[Cessna 162]] would be made in the People's Republic of China by [[Shenyang Aircraft Corporation]], which is a subsidiary of China Aviation Industry Corporation I (AVIC I), a Chinese [[Government-owned corporation|government-owned]] consortium of aircraft manufacturers.<ref name="Textron2">{{cite web|url = http://investor.textron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=110047&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1081831&highlight=|title = Cessna Chooses China's Shenyang Aircraft Corporation as Manufacturing Partner for Model 162 SkyCatcher|accessdate = 2007-11-28|last = Textron|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = November}}</ref> By manufacturing the aircraft in China, Cessna reports it saved USD$71,000 in production costs ''per'' aircraft, or about 40% of the cost. A second reason cited for moving production to Shenyang Aircraft Corporation was Cessna had no plant capacity available in the USA at the time.<ref name = "wrtvdo">{{cite web

Cessna received a high degree of negative feedback from 162 customers and potential customers regarding this decision. Complaints centered on the recent problems with Chinese production of other consumer products, China's human rights record, exporting of jobs, and China's less than friendly political relationship with the USA.<ref name="Aniello">{{cite web|url = http://www.cessnaskycatcher.com/home/124.html |title = Making the case for building the SkyCatcher in China|accessdate = 2008-01-03|last = Aniello|first = Tom|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = December |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080106070032/http://www.cessnaskycatcher.com/home/124.html |archivedate = 6 January 2008}}</ref> The backlash surprised Cessna and resulted in a company public relations campaign to try to explain the decision from a business perspective and assure customers that quality of the aircraft will not be compromised.<ref name="Grady02">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/RemosAircraft_Germany_Expanding_ChallengesCessna_196872-1.html|title = Germany's Remos Aircraft Expanding, Challenges Cessna|accessdate = 2008-01-03|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = January}}</ref> The reaction to the explanations and assurances has been overwhelmingly negative, although a small number of customers have applauded the production in China.<ref name="Aniello"/>

In early 2009 the company attracted further criticism for continuing plans to build the 162 in China while laying off large numbers of workers in the USA.<ref name="AvWeb02Feb09">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/eletter/archives/avflash/1307-full.html|title = Cessna Layoffs Continue |accessdate = 2009-02-02|last = AvWeb Staff|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = January}}</ref>

===2008–10 economic crisis===
[[Image:cessna 525 citationjet g-sfcj arp.jpg|thumb|[[Cessna CitationJet|Cessna 525 CitationJet]]]]

The company's business suffered notably during the [[Late-2000s recession]], laying off more than half its workforce between January 2009 and September 2010.

On 4 November 2008 Cessna's parent company, [[Textron]], indicated that [[Cessna Citation|Citation]] production would be reduced from the original 2009 target of 535 "due to continued softening in the global economic environment" and that this would result in an undetermined number of lay-offs at Cessna.<ref name="AvWeb04Nov08">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebbiz/news/CessnaSlowsCitationProduction_CitingGlobalEconomy_199121-1.html|title = Cessna Slows Citation Production, Citing Global Economy |accessdate = 2008-11-06|last = Grady|first = Mary F.|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}</ref>

On 8 November 2008, at the [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association|AOPA]] Expo, CEO [[Jack J. Pelton|Jack Pelton]] indicated that Cessna sales of aircraft to individual buyers had fallen but piston and turboprop sales to business had not. "While the economic slowdown has created a difficult business environment, we are encouraged by brisk activity from new and existing propeller fleet operators placing almost 200 orders for 2009 production aircraft," Pelton stated.<ref name="AvWeb08Nov08">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/news/aopa/AOPAExpo2008_CessnaAircraft_BuyersMarket_199162-1.html|title = It's a Buyer's Market|accessdate = 2008-11-08|last = Niles|first = Russ|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}</ref><ref name="KWCH04Nov08">{{cite web|url = http://www.kwch.com/Global/story.asp?S=9292651&nav=menu486_2_3|title = Cessna Announces Possible Layoffs|accessdate = 2008-11-04|last = Durden|first = Chris|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}</ref>

On 13 November 2008, Cessna announced that a total of 665 jobs would be cut at its [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and [[Bend, Oregon]] plants starting in January 2009. The Cessna factory at [[Independence, Kansas]], which builds the Cessna piston-engined aircraft and the [[Cessna Mustang]], was not forecast to see any layoffs, but one third of the workforce at the former [[Columbia Aircraft]] facility in Bend was laid off. This included 165 of the 460 employees who built the [[Cessna 350]] and [[Cessna 400|400]]. The remaining 500 jobs were eliminated at the main Cessna Wichita plant.<ref name="AvWeb13Nov08">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/EclipseAviation_Misses_Payroll_TVreport_199202-1.html|title = Eclipse Misses Payroll: TV Report  |accessdate = 2008-11-13|last = Niles|first = Russ|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}</ref>

In January 2009 the company announced 2,000 additional layoffs, bringing the total to 4,600. The job cuts included 120 at the Bend, Oregon facility reducing the plant that built the Cessna 350 and 400 to fewer than half the number of workers that it had when Cessna bought it. Other cuts included 200 at the Independence, Kansas plant that builds the single-engined Cessnas and the Mustang, reducing that facility to 1,300 workers.<ref name="AvWeb31Jan09">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_layoff_wichita_textron_pelton_199682-1.html|title = Cessna Layoffs Continue |accessdate = 2009-02-02|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = January}}</ref>

On 29 April 2009 the company announced that it was suspending the [[Cessna Citation Columbus|Citation Columbus]] program and closing the Bend, Oregon facility. The Columbus program was finally cancelled in early July 2009. The company said "Upon additional analysis of the business jet market related to this product offering, we decided to formally cancel further development of the Citation Columbus". With the 350 and 400 production moving to Kansas, the company indicated that it would lay off 1,600 more workers, including the remaining 150 employees at the Bend plant and up to 700 workers from the Columbus program.<ref name="AvWeb29Apr09">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaWillSuspendColumbusProgramAndCloseBendFactory_200284-1.html|title = Cessna Will Suspend Columbus Program, Close Bend Factory|accessdate = 2009-04-30|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = April}}</ref><ref name="AvWeb14Jul09">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaCancelsExtraLargeColumbusJetProgram_200720-1.html|title = Goodbye, Columbus – Cessna Cancels Extra-Large Jet Program |accessdate = 2009-07-16|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = July}}</ref>

In early June 2009 Cessna announced that it would lay off an additional 700 salaried employees, bringing the total number of lay-offs to 7600 or more than half the company's workers.<ref name="AvWeb05Jun09">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_layoff_wichita_columbus_mustang_200511-1.html|title = More Layoffs at Cessna|accessdate = 2009-06-08|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = June}}</ref>

In December 2009 the company announced that it will close its three [[Columbus, Georgia]] manufacturing facilities between June 2010 and December 2011. The closures will include the new {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility that was opened in August 2008 at a cost of US$25M, plus the [[McCauley Propeller Systems]] plant. These closures will result in total job losses of 600 in Georgia. Some of the work will be relocated to Cessna's Independence, Kansas or Mexican facilities.<ref name="AvWeb11Dec09">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_columbus_mccauley_jobs_cut_wichita_mexico_201673-1.html|title = Cessna Closing Plants, Cutting Jobs|accessdate = 2009-12-14|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = December}}</ref>

Cessna's parent company Textron posted a loss of US$8M in the first quarter of 2010, largely driven by continuing low sales at Cessna, which were down 44%. Cessna's workforce remained 50% laid-off and CEO Jack Pelton stated that he expected the recovery to be long and slow.<ref name="AvWeb27Apr10">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebbiz/news/CessnaDeclinesSapsTextron_202461-1.html|title = Cessna Declines Sap Textron Revenues|accessdate = 28 April 2010|last = Niles|first = Russ|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = April}}</ref>

In September 2010 Cessna CEO Jack Pelton announced a further 700 layoffs, bringing the total to 8,000 jobs lost. Pelton indicated this round of layoffs was due to a "stalled [and] lackluster economy" and noted that while the number of orders cancelled for jets has been decreasing new orders have not met expectations. Pelton added "our strategy is to defend and protect our current markets while investing in products and services to secure our future, but we can do this only if we succeed in restructuring our processes and reducing our costs."<ref name="AvWeb22Sep10">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaToCut700Jobs_203322-1.html|title = Cessna To Cut 700 Jobs|accessdate = 23 September 2010|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = September}}</ref>

===2010s===
On 2 May 2011 CEO [[Jack Pelton]] retired. The new CEO, [[Scott A. Ernest]], started on 31 May 2011.<ref>[http://www.cessna.com/MungoBlobs/166/391/CSN_06_08_11com.pdf Press release by Cessna Aircraft Company]</ref> Ernest joined Textron after 29 years at [[General Electric|GE]], where he had most recently served as vice president and general manager, global supply chain for [[GE Aviation]].

In September 2011 the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] proposed a US$2.4M fine against the company for its failure to follow quality assurance requirements while producing fiberglass components at its plant in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], Mexico. Excess humidity meant that the parts did not cure correctly and quality assurance did not detect the problems. The failure to follow procedures resulted in the delamination in flight of a {{convert|7|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} section of one [[Cessna 400]]'s wing skin from the [[spar (aviation)|spar]] while the aircraft was being flown by an FAA test pilot. The aircraft was landed safely. The FAA also discovered 82 other aircraft parts that had been incorrectly made and not detected by the company's quality assurance. The investigation resulted in an emergency [[airworthiness directive]] that affected 13 Cessna 400s.<ref name="AVweb">{{Cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_corvalis_wing_composite_fine_FAA_205442-1.html|title = Corvalis Wing Prompts $2.4 Million Proposed Fine|accessdate = 24 September 2011|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = September| work = AVweb}}</ref>

On 23 March 2012 Cessna announced that it is pursuing building business jets in China as part of a joint venture with [[Aviation Industry Corporation of China]] (AVIC). The company stated that it intends to eventually build all aircraft models in China, saying "The agreements together pave the way for a range of business jets, utility single-engine turboprops and single-engine piston aircraft to be manufactured and certified in China."<ref name="Niles23Mar12">{{cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Cessna_China_Business_Jets_206365-1.html|title = Cessna Wants To Build Jets in China|accessdate = 26 March 2012|last = Niles|first = Russ|date = 23 March 2012| work = AVweb}}</ref><ref name="CessnaPressRel23Mar12">{{cite web|url = http://www.cessna.com/NewReleases/FeaturedNews/NewReleaseNumber-1192384202959.html|title = Cessna and AVIC Join Forces to Develop General and Business Aviation in China|accessdate = 26 March 2012|last = Cessna |date = 23 March 2012}}</ref>

==Marketing Initiatives==<!-- This section is linked from [[Cessna 172]] -->
During the 1950s and 1960s Cessna's marketing department followed the lead of Detroit automakers and came up with many unique marketing terms in an effort to differentiate its product line from their competitions'.

Other manufacturers and the aviation press widely ridiculed and spoofed many of the marketing terms, but Cessna built and sold more aircraft than any other manufacturer during the boom years of the 1960s and 1970s.

===Company terminology===
[[Image:Cessna 150E (C-GFAU).jpg|thumb|right|A 1965 Cessna 150E. The 1964 model 150D and the 150E introduced Omni-Vision rear windows on the Model 150]]
Cessna marketing terminology includes:
*'''Para-Lift Flaps''' – these were the large [[Fowler flaps]] Cessna introduced on the [[Cessna 170|170]]B in 1952, replacing the narrow chord plain flaps then in use.<ref name="Clarke">Clarke, Bill: ''Cessna 150 and 152'' first edition, pages 5–17. TAB Books, 1987. ISBN 0-8306-9022-0</ref>
*'''Land-O-Matic''' – In 1956, Cessna introduced sprung-steel [[tricycle landing gear]] on the 172. The marketing department chose “Land-O-Matic” to imply that these aircraft were much easier to land and take off than the preceding [[conventional landing gear]] equipped Cessna 170. They even went as far as to say pilots could do “drive-up take-offs and drive-in landings”, implying that flying these aircraft was as easy as driving a car. In later years some Cessna models had their steel sprung landing gear replaced with steel tube gear legs. The [[Cessna 206|206]] retains the original spring steel landing gear today.<ref name="Clarke" />
*'''Omni-Vision''' – This referred to the rear windows on some Cessna singles, starting with the [[Cessna 182|182]] and [[Cessna 210|210]] in 1962, the [[Cessna 172|172]] in 1963 and the [[Cessna 150|150]] in 1964. The term was intended to make the pilot feel visibility was improved on the notably poor-visibility Cessna line. The introduction of the rear window caused in most models a loss of cruise speed due to the extra drag, while not adding any useful visibility.<ref name="Clarke" />
*'''Cushioned power''' – This was to announce the introduction of rubber mounts on the cowling of the 1967 model 150, in addition to the rubber mounts isolating the engine from the cabin.
*'''Omni-Flash''' – This referred to the flashing beacon on the tip of the fin that could be seen all around.
*'''Open-View''' – This referred to the removal of the top section of the control wheel in 1967 models. These had been rectangular, they now became “ram’s horn” shaped, thus not blocking the instrument panel as much.
*'''Quick-Scan''' – Cessna introduced a new instrument panel layout in the 1960s and this buzzword was to indicate Cessna’s panels were ahead of the competition.
*'''Nav-O-Matic''' – This was the name of the Cessna autopilot system, which implied the system was relatively simple.
*'''Camber-Lift''' – This marketing name was used to describe Cessna aircraft wings starting in 1972 when the aerodynamics designers at Cessna added a slightly drooped [[leading edge]] to the standard [[NACA airfoil|NACA 2412]] [[airfoil]] used on most of the light aircraft fleet. Writer Joe Christy described the name as "stupid" and added "Is there any other kind [of lift]?"<ref name="ChristyJ">Christy, Joe: ''The Complete Guide to the Single Engine Cessnas – Third Edition'', page 119. TAB Books, 1979. ISBN 0-8306-2268-3</ref>
*'''Stabila-Tip''' – Cessna started commonly using wingtip [[fuel tanks]], carefully shaped for aerodynamic effect rather than being tubular-shaped. Tip tanks do have an advantage of reducing [[free surface effect]] of fuel affecting the balance of the aircraft in rolling manoeuvres.
