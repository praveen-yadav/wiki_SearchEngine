==Local government==
The area was part of the ancient [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] [[parish]] of [[Mynyddislwyn]] until the late 19th century. In 1892 a [[local board of health]] and local government district of Abercarn was formed.<ref>Formed as Newbridge local board and local government district on 17 March 1892, renamed Abercarn on 4 July that year. County Census Report 1670, Monmouthshire</ref> This became Abercarn urban district in 1894, governed by an urban district council of twelve members. Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] the urban district was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the borough of [[Islwyn]], [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]. Further local government organisation in 1996 placed the area in the county borough of Caerphilly. The former urban district corresponds to the three communities of Abercarn, [[Crumlin, Caerphilly|Crumlin]] and [[Newbridge, Caerphilly|Newbridge]].

==Sport==
Abercarn is home to [[Abercarn RFC|Abercarn Rugby Club]] which is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union.
