The '''Chadic languages''' constitute a language family of perhaps 150 languages spoken across northern [[Nigeria]], southern [[Niger]], southern [[Chad]], [[Central African Republic]] and northern [[Cameroon]], that are a branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]]. The most widely spoken Chadic language is [[Hausa language|Hausa]], a [[lingua franca]] of much of inland West Africa. 

Newman (1977) classified the languages into four groups which have been accepted in all subsequent literature. Further subbranching, however, has not been as robust; Blench (2006), for example, only accepts the A/B bifurcation of East Chadic.<ref>Blench, 2006.

==Origin==
[[File:385779 331267023551254 1444737322hdgdfsf n.jpg|thumb|The migration root of R1b R-V88 DNA into Africa, along with the speakers of the Chadic languages, according to Cruciani.]]
Modern genetic studies of populations which speak Chadic languages has shown high frequencies of the [[Y-Chromosome]] [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup R1b]] (specifically the R1b R-V88 variant), a marker which is common in parts of Europe and Asia, but otherwise rare in Africa. This has led to the theory that the Proto-Chadic people originated in Asia (the [[Middle East]]) before entering Africa as early as 7 thousand years ago, probably before the [[First Dynasty of Egypt]].<ref>[http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v18/n7/abs/ejhg2009231a.html Human Y chromosome haplogroup R-V88: a paternal genetic record of early mid Holocene trans-Saharan connections and the spread of Chadic languages by Fulvio Cruciani, et all] [[European Journal of Human Genetics]] - [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]</ref> The speakers of Proto-Chadic might have been a Levantine population dating back to an African migration (a "back-migration").{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
