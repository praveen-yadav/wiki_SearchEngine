'''Ellas Otha Bates''' (December 30, 1928 – June 2, 2008), known by his [[stage name]] '''Bo Diddley''', was an American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] vocalist, [[guitar]]ist and [[songwriter]] (usually as '''Ellas McDaniel'''). He was also known as '''The Originator''' because of his key role in the transition from the [[blues]] to [[rock music|rock]], influencing a host of acts, including [[Buddy Holly]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[The Velvet Underground]], [[The Who]], [[The Yardbirds]], [[Eric Clapton]],<ref name="Mick">{{cite web |url=http://showbizspy.com/news/06032008/mick-jagger-leads-tribute-for-diddley |title=Mick Jagger Leads Tribute For Diddley |accessdate=October 27, 2008 |last=WENN |date=June 3, 2008 |work=showbizspy.com}}</ref> [[Elvis Presley]],<ref>{{Cite book|last= Fox |first= Ted |title= Showtime at the Apollo |publisher= Da Capo |year= 1983 |isbn= 978-0-306-80503-5 |pages=5 & 92 |quote=Elvis Presley, a young, still raw hayseed, was making his first trip to the Big Apple to see his new record company, and the Apollo was where he wanted to be.

==History==

===Early life and career===
Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]], as Ellas Otha Bates,<ref>Some sources give his name as Otha Ellas Bates.</ref> he was adopted and raised by his mother's cousin, Gussie McDaniel, whose surname he assumed, becoming Ellas McDaniel. In 1934, the McDaniel family moved to the largely black [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] area of Chicago, where the young man dropped the name Otha and became known as Ellas McDaniel, until his musical ambitions demanded that he take on a more catchy identity. In Chicago, he was an active member of his local [[Ebenezer Baptist Church (Chicago, Illinois)|Ebenezer Baptist Church]], where he studied the [[trombone]] and the [[violin]], becoming proficient enough on the latter for the musical director to invite him to join the orchestra, with which he performed until the age of 18. He was more impressed, however, by the pulsating, rhythmic music he heard at a local [[Pentecostal Church]], and he also became interested in the guitar.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2066171/Bo-Diddley.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Bo Diddley Bo Diddley, who has died aged 79, was one of the most important influences in the development of popular music, even though for much of his career he was seldom in the charts or in the recording studio. | date=June 2, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsimon.com/diddley.htm |title=Bo Diddley Page |publisher=Tsimon.com |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

Inspired by a concert where he saw [[John Lee Hooker]] perform,<ref name="autogenerated1"/> he supplemented his work as a carpenter and mechanic with a developing career [[busking|playing on street corners]] with friends, including Jerome Green (c. 1934–1973),<ref>{{cite web|author=David Blakey |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/jerome.html |title=Jerome Green |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref> in a band called The Hipsters (later The Langley Avenue Jive Cats).

In late 1954, he teamed up with [[harmonica]] player [[Billy Boy Arnold]], [[drummer]] Clifton James, and [[Bassist|bass player]] Roosevelt Jackson, and recorded [[Demo (music)|demos]] of "[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm A Man]]" and "[[Bo Diddley (song)|Bo Diddley]]". They re-recorded the songs at [[Chess Records|Chess Studios]] with a backing [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] comprising [[Otis Spann]] (piano), [[Lester Davenport]] (harmonica), Frank Kirkland (drums), and Jerome Green (maracas). The record was released in March 1955, and the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]], "Bo Diddley", became a number one R&B hit.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Stage name===
McDaniel adopted the stage name ''Bo Diddley''.  The origin of the name is somewhat unclear, as several differing stories and claims exist. Diddley claims that his peers gave him the nickname, which he first suspected to be an insult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19748/m1/ |title=Show 3 – The Tribal Drum: The rise of rhythm and blues. [Part 1&#93; : UNT Digital Library  |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref> Bo Diddley himself said that the name first belonged to a singer his adoptive mother was familiar with, while harmonicist [[Billy Boy Arnold]] once said in an interview that it was originally the name of a local comedian that [[Leonard Chess]] borrowed for the song title and artist name for Bo Diddley's first single, and guitar craftsman Ed Roman reported that another (unspecified) source says it was his nickname as a Golden Gloves boxer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.celebrityrockstarguitars.com/rock/diddley_bo.htm |title=Ed Roman on Bo' Diddley  RIP |author=Ed Roman |year=2005 |work=Celebrity Rock Star Guitars |accessdate=May 2, 2012}}</ref>

A "[[diddley bow]]" is a typically homemade American string instrument of African origin, probably influenced by instruments found on the coast of west Africa.<ref>Chris Morris, ''I'm A Man: The Chess Masters, 1955–1958'' liner notes, [[Geffen Records]], February 2007</ref>

The American slang phrase ''bo diddly'' meaning "absolutely nothing" goes back possibly to the early 20th century or earlier. ''Diddly'' is a truncation of ''diddly-squat'', retaining the same meaning<ref>{{cite book |last = Spears |first = Richard A. |title = McGraw-Hill's Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions |publisher = McGraw-Hill |edition = 4th |year = 2005 |page = 425 |isbn = 978-0-07-146107-8 }}</ref> of "nothing"<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Lighter |first1 = J.

===Success in the 1950s and 1960s===
On November 20, 1955, he appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', a popular television [[variety show]], where he infuriated [[Ed Sullivan|the host]]. "I did two songs and he got mad," Bo Diddley later recalled. "Ed Sullivan said that I was one of the first colored boys to ever double-cross him. Said that I wouldn't last six months". The show had requested that he sing the [[Merle Travis]]-penned [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] hit "[[Sixteen Tons]]", but when he appeared on stage, he sang "Bo Diddley" instead. This substitution resulted in his being banned from further appearances.

The request came about because Sullivan's people heard Diddley casually singing "Sixteen Tons" in the dressing room. Diddley's accounts of the event were inconsistent.<ref>TV-a-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol. Jake Austen. Edition: illustrated. Chicago Review Press. 2005. pages 14, 15. ISBN 1-55652-572-9, ISBN 978-1-55652-572-8</ref>

Diddley was an excellent story teller whose stories varied from time to time, however, Diddley contended to friends and family that he was not trying to double-cross Sullivan and attributed the "misunderstanding" to the fact that when he saw "Bo Diddley" on a cue card, he was under the impression he was to perform two songs, "Bo Diddley" and "Sixteen Tons".

Chess included Diddley's recording of "Sixteen Tons" on the album ''[[Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Bo-Diddley-Gunslinger/dp/B0001XAQSW#moreAboutThisProduct |title=Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger: Bo Diddley: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> which was originally released in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dustygroove.com/item.php?id=sx6fryfrvp&ref=browse.php&refQ=cat%3D11%26amp%3Bpage%3D5 |title=Dusty Groove America – Bo Diddley: Bo Diddley Is A Gunslinger |publisher=Dustygroove.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

He continued to have hits through the rest of the 1950s and even the 1960s, including "Pretty Thing" (1956), "Say Man" (1959), and "[[You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover]]" (1962). He released a string of albums whose titles, including ''Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger'' and ''Have Guitar, Will Travel'', bolstered his self-invented legend.<ref name="SoundsShow"/> Between 1958 and 1963, [[Checker Records]] released 11 full-length albums by Bo Diddley. Although he broke through as a crossover artist with white audiences (appearing at the [[Alan Freed]] concerts, for example) during the early 1960s,<ref name="SoundsShow"/> he rarely tailored his compositions to teenage concerns. The album title ''Surfing with Bo Diddley'' was a boast about his influence on [[surf music|surf]] guitarists.

In 1963, he starred in a UK concert tour with the [[Everly Brothers]] and [[Little Richard]]. [[The Rolling Stones]], still barely known outside London at that time, appeared as a supporting act on the same bill.

In addition to the many songs recorded by him, in 1956 he co-wrote, with Jody Williams, the pioneering [[pop music|pop song]] "[[Love Is Strange]]", a hit for [[Mickey & Sylvia]] in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Blakey |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/career50s.html |title=BO DIDDLEY – The Originator |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

Bo Diddley was one of the first American male musicians to include women in his band, including "The Duchess" [[Norma-Jean Wofford]], Peggy Jones (aka "Lady Bo"), Cornelia Redmond (aka Cookie), and Debby Hastings, who led his band for the final 25 years of his performing career. After moving from his home in Chicago to Washington, D.C., he set up one of the first [[home recording]] [[recording studio|studios]] where he not only recorded the album ''Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger'' but he recorded his valet, [[Marvin Gaye]]. The Diddley-penned, "Wyatt Earp" was a single released on [[Okeh Records]], since the Chess brothers did not want to release the record. Also during this time, [[Moonglows]] founder [[Harvey Fuqua]] who sang background on many of Diddley's home studio recordings was introduced to Gaye, and asked him to join the Moonglows. When Fuqua went to Motown, Gaye followed.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/bo-diddley |title=Bo Diddley |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

===Later years===
[[File:Bo-Diddley.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bo Diddley touring Japan with Japanese band Bo Gumbos]]
Over the decades, Bo Diddley's venues ranged from intimate clubs to stadiums. On March 25, 1972, he played with [[The Grateful Dead]] at the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]] in New York City. The Grateful Dead released part of this concert as Volume 30 of the band's ''[[Dick's Picks]]'' concert album series. Also in the early 1970s, the soundtrack for the ground-breaking animated film ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz The Cat]]'' contained his song "Bo Diddley", in which a crow idly [[Fingerstyle guitar|finger-pops]] along to the track.

Bo Diddley spent many years in [[New Mexico]], living in [[Los Lunas, New Mexico]] from 1971 to 1978 while continuing his musical career. He served for two and a half years as Deputy Sheriff in the [[Valencia County, New Mexico|Valencia County]] Citizens' Patrol; during that time he purchased and donated three highway patrol pursuit cars.<ref name="nmmc">[http://www.newmexicomusic.org/noteable.php?select=5 New Mexico Music Commission | Notable New Mexicans |]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> In the late 1970s, Diddley left Los Lunas and moved to [[Hawthorne, Florida]] where he lived on a large estate in a custom made log-cabin home, which he helped to build. For the remainder of his life he spent time between [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] and Florida, living the last 13 years of his life in [[Archer, Florida]], a small farming town near [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]].

He appeared as an opening act for [[The Clash]] in their 1979 US tour; in ''Legends of Guitar'' (filmed live in Spain, 1991) with [[B.B. King]], [[Les Paul]], [[Albert Collins]], [[George Benson]], among others, and joined [[The Rolling Stones]] as a guest on their 1994 concert broadcast of ''[[Voodoo Lounge]]'', performing "[[Who Do You Love?]]" with the band. [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[Robert Cray]] also appeared on the pay-per-view special.

===Illness===
On May 13, 2007, Bo Diddley was admitted to [[intensive care]] in [[Creighton University Medical Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], following a [[stroke]] after a concert in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] on May 12.<ref>[http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=60a08a4d-9f34-45ac-b395-c284d9a5ef50&entry=index Rock Pioneer Bo Diddley Sidelined by Stroke E!News]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> Starting the show, he had complained that he did not feel well. He referred to smoke from the wildfires that were ravaging South Georgia and blowing south to the area near his home in Archer, Florida. Nonetheless, he delivered an energetic performance to an enthusiastic crowd. The next day, as Diddley was heading back home, he seemed dazed and confused at the airport. His manager, Margo Lewis, called 911 and airport security and Diddley was immediately taken by ambulance to Creighton University Medical Center and admitted to the [[Intensive-care unit]], where he stayed for several days. After numerous tests, it was confirmed that he had suffered a [[stroke]].<ref>[http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=5c8535ca-4223-4537-834e-ecb19af35ddf Bo Diddley Bouncing Back E!News]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> Diddley had a history of [[hypertension]] and [[diabetes]], and the stroke affected the left side of his brain, causing receptive and expressive [[aphasia]] (speech impairment).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/entertainment/13334586/detail.html |title=Publicist: Bo Diddley Hospitalized After Stroke – Entertainment News Story – WTAE Pittsburgh |publisher=Thepittsburghchannel.com |date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> The stroke was followed by a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], suffered in Gainesville, Florida, on August 28, 2007.<ref name="Ratliff">Ben Ratliff, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/arts/music/03diddley.html?_r=1&scp=3&sq=bo+diddley&st=nyt&oref=slogin "Bo Diddley, Who Gave Rock His Beat, Dies at 79"]. ''New York Times'', June 3, 2008, p. A1</ref>

While recovering from the stroke and heart attack, Diddley came back to his home town of McComb, Mississippi, in early November 2007 for the unveiling of a plaque devoted to him on the National Blues Trail stating that he was "acclaimed as a founder of rock and roll." He was not supposed to perform, but as he listened to the music of local musician Jesse Robinson who sang a song written for this occasion, Robinson sensed that he wanted to perform and handed him a microphone. That was the first and last time that Bo Diddley performed publicly after suffering a stroke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlbt.com/Global/story.asp?S=7305146&nav=menu119_3 |title=WLBT 3 – Jackson, MS: Bo Diddley Honored In Hometown |publisher=Wlbt.com |date=January 1, 2010 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

His funeral, a four-hour "homegoing" service, took place on June 7, 2008, at Showers of Blessings Church in Gainesville, Florida and kept in tune with the vibrant spirit of Bo Diddley's life and career.

After the funeral service, a tribute concert was held at the Martin Luther King Center, also in Gainesville, and featured performances by his son and daughter, Anthony McDaniel and Evelyn Kelly, long-time background vocalist Gloria Jolivet, co-producer Scott "Skyntyte" Free, Diddley's touring band, The Debby Hastings Band, and guest artist [[Eric Burdon]].

In the days following his death, tributes were paid to him by then-President [[George W. Bush]], the [[United States House of Representatives]], and an uncounted number of musicians and performers, including [[Eric Burdon]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Ronnie Hawkins]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[B. B. King]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], George Thorogood, [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band]], the [[Black Lips]] and [[Ronnie Wood]]. He was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded a [[Doctor of Fine Arts]] degree by the [[University of Florida]] for his influence on American popular music and in its "People in America" radio series about influential people in American history, the [[Voice of America]] radio service paid tribute to him, describing how "his influence was so widespread that it is hard to imagine what rock and roll would have sounded like without him." [[Mick Jagger]] stated that "he was a wonderful, original musician who was an enormous force in music and was a big influence on [[The Rolling Stones]]. He was very generous to us in our early years and we learned a lot from him." Jagger also praised the late star as a one of a kind musician, adding, "We will never see his like again.<ref name="Mick"/>

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him No. 20 on their list of the [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/ 100 Greatest Artists of All Time].<ref>{{cite web| title = The Immortals: The First Fifty| work = ''Rolling Stone'' Issue 946| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty}}</ref>

In 2005, Bo Diddley celebrated his 50th anniversary in music with successful tours of Australia and Europe, and with coast-to-coast shows across North America. He performed his song "Bo Diddley" with [[Eric Clapton]], [[Robbie Robertson]], and longtime bassist and musical director Debby Hastings at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s 20th annual induction ceremony and in the UK, ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine included his 1957 debut album "Bo Diddley" in its listing of the '100 Music, Movie & TV Moments That Have Changed The World'.

In 2006, Bo Diddley participated as the headliner of a [[grassroots]] organized fundraiser concert, to benefit the town of [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], which had been devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The "Florida Keys for Katrina Relief" had originally been set for October 23, 2005, when [[Hurricane Wilma]] barreled through the [[Florida Keys]] on October 24, causing flooding and economic mayhem. In January 2006, the Florida Keys had recovered enough to host the fundraising concert to benefit the more hard-hit community of Ocean Springs. When asked about the fundraiser Bo Diddley stated, "This is the United States of America. We believe in helping one another.".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com/musical_performers.htm |title=Musical Performers |publisher=Floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com |date=January 8, 2006 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> In an interview with Holger Petersen, on ''[[Saturday Night Blues]]'' on [[CBC Radio]] in the fall of 2006<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/snb/latestshow.html | work=CBC News | title=CBC Radio – Saturday Night Blues – Past Shows | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> Bo Diddley commented about the [[racism]] that existed in the music industry establishment during the early part of his career that saw him deprived of his [[royalties]] from the most successful part of his career.

Bo Diddley performed a number of shows around the country in 2005 and 2006 with the fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson Band]], featuring Johnson on keyboards, Richard Hunt on drums, and Gus Thornton on bass.

Bo Diddley is well known for the ''Bo Diddley beat'', which is essentially the [[clave rhythm]], and one of the most common [[bell pattern]]s found in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]].<ref>Peñalosa, David (2010: 244). ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins''. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. ISBN 1-886502-80-3.</ref> Tamlyn found this rhythm in 13 Rhythm and Blues recordings made in the years 1944-55, including two by Johnny Otis from 1948.<ref>The Big Beat: Orgigins and Development of Snare Backbeat and other Accompanimental Rhythms in Rock'n'Roll. Garry Neville Tamlym. PhD thesis. March 1998. Table 4.16. page 284</ref>

Bo Diddley has given different accounts regarding how he began to use this rhythm. Sublette asserts: "In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], 'Bo Diddley' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'Rhumba' on the track sheets."<ref>Sublette, Ned (2007: 83). "The Kingsmen and the Cha-cha-chá." Ed. Eric Weisbard. ''Listen Again: A Momentary History of Pop Music''. Duke University Press. ISBN 0822340410</ref> The Bo Diddley beat is similar to "[[Juba dance|hambone]]", a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms, legs, chest, and cheeks while chanting rhymes.<ref>Roscetti, Ed (2008). ''Stuff! Good Drummers Should Know'', p. 16. Hal Leonard Corporation. ISBN 1-4234-2848-X.</ref> Somewhat resembling [[Shave and a Haircut|"shave and a haircut, two bits"]] rhythm, Diddley came across it while trying to play [[Gene Autry]]'s "(I've Got Spurs That) [[Jingle, Jangle, Jingle]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/multi/feature/ID/298/Blues+Reflections:+2003 |title=Blues Reflections |publisher=Afropop.org |date=April 3, 1970 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> Three years before Bo's "Bo Diddley", a song similar syncopation "Hambone", was cut by [[Red Saunders (musician)|Red Saunders]]' Orchestra with The Hambone Kids. In 1944, "[[Rum and Coca Cola]]", containing the Bo Diddley beat, was recorded by [[The Andrews Sisters]] and later [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]" (1957) and [[Them (band)|Them]]'s "[[Mystic Eyes]]" (1965) used the beat.<ref name="Sixties">Hicks, Michaël (2000). ''Sixties Rock'', p.36. ISBN 978-0-252-06915-4.</ref> In its simplest form, the Bo Diddley beat can be counted out as either an one-bar, or a two-bar phrase.

Other songs employing the Bo Diddley beat include "[[(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame]]" (1961) by [[Elvis Presley]], "[[I Want Candy]]" by [[The Strangeloves]], "[[The Stooges (album)|1969]]" (1969) by [[The Stooges]], "[[Panic in Detroit]]" (1973) by [[David Bowie]], "[[Mr. Brownstone]]" (1987) by [[Guns N' Roses]], "Hari Krsna" (lyrics are even sung to the tune of 'Hey Bo Diddley') by [[Hüsker Dü]] from their album [[Zen Arcade]], "[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]] (1987) by [[George Michael]], "[[Desire (U2 song)|Desire]]" (1988) by [[U2]], "Boa-Diddley" (1990) by [[Phillip Boa]] and the Voodooclub, "[[Screamadelica|Movin' on Up]]" (1991) by [[Primal Scream]], "[[Stanley Road|Woodcutter's Son]]" (1995) by [[Paul Weller]], and "[[The White Stripes (album)|Screwdriver]]" (1999) by [[The White Stripes]].<ref name="harris149">{{cite book|last=Harris|first=John|title=Hail!

Here is the count as a one-bar phrase: '''One''' e and '''ah''', two e '''and''' ah, three e '''and''' ah, '''four''' e and ah. The '''bolded''' counts are the [[Clave (rhythm)|clave]] rhythm.

Many songs (for example, "[[Hey Bo Diddley]]" and "[[Who Do You Love?]]") often have no [[chord (music)|chord]] changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic [[tension (music)|tension and release]]. In his other recordings, Bo Diddley used a variety of rhythms, from straight [[beat (music)|back beat]] to [[Popular music|pop]] [[ballad]] style to [[doo-wop]], frequently with maracas by Jerome Green.

Also an influential guitar player, he developed many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack. Bo Diddley's trademark instrument was the rectangular-bodied [[Gretsch]] nicknamed "The Twang Machine" (referred to as "cigar-box shaped" by music promoter [[Dick Clark]]). Although he had other odd-shaped guitars custom-made for him by other manufacturers throughout the years, most notably the "Cadillac" design made by Tom Holmes (who also made guitars for ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, among others), Diddley fashioned the square guitar himself around 1958 and wielded it in thousands of concerts over the years. In a 2005 interview on [[Triple J|JJJ]] radio in Australia, Bo implied that the design sprang from an embarrassing moment. During an early gig, while jumping around on stage with a [[Gibson L5]] guitar, he landed awkwardly hurting his groin.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/boone_m1035862.mp3</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/bodidleytw_m1035870.mp3</ref> He then went about designing a smaller, less restrictive guitar that allowed him to keep jumping around on stage while still playing his guitar. He also played the [[violin]], which is featured on his mournful [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] "The Clock Strikes Twelve", a [[twelve-bar blues]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/buyersguides/gr/diddleymasters.htm |title=Bo Diddley – I'm a Man: The Chess Masters, 1955–1958 – CD review |publisher=Oldies.about.com |date=February 25, 2008 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

He often created lyrics as witty and humorous adaptations of [[folk music]] themes. The song "Bo Diddley" was based on the African American clapping rhyme "[[Juba dance|Hambone]]" (which in turn was based on the [[lullaby]] "[[Hush Little Baby]]"). Likewise, "Hey Bo Diddley" is based on the song "[[Old MacDonald]]". The [[roots of hip hop|rap]]-style boasting of "Who Do You Love", a wordplay on [[hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]], used many striking lyrics from the African-American tradition of [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasts]] and boasts. His "Say Man" and "Say Man, Back Again," both of which were later cited as progenerators of hip-hop music, share a strong connection to the insult game known as "[[the dozens]]". For example: "You got the nerve to call somebody ugly, why you so ugly the stork that brought you into the world ought to be arrested".<ref>"Say Man" (McDaniels) 1958</ref>
