'''Blues''' is the name given to both a [[musical form]] and a [[music genre]]<ref>Kunzler's dictionary of Jazz provides two separate entries: blues, an originally African-American genre (p.128), and the blues form, a widespread musical form (p.131).</ref> that originated in [[:African-American]] communities of primarily the "[[Deep South]]" of the [[United States]] around the end of the 19th century from [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[work song]]s, [[field holler]]s, [[Ring shout|shouts]] and [[chant]]s, and rhymed simple narrative [[ballad (music)|ballads]].<ref name="The Evolution of Differing Blues Styles">{{cite web|title=The Evolution of Differing Blues Styles|publisher=How To Play Blues Guitar|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://how-to-play-blues-guitar.com/the-blues/the-evolution-of-different-blues-styles/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5msLYV7tu|archivedate=2010-01-18|deadurl=no}}</ref> The blues form, ubiquitous in [[jazz]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[rock and roll]] is characterized by specific chord progressions, of which the [[twelve-bar blues]] chord progression is the most common. The [[blue note]]s that, for expressive purposes are sung or played flattened or gradually bent (minor 3rd to major 3rd) in relation to the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the [[major scale]], are also an important part of the sound.

The blues genre is based on the blues form but possesses other characteristics such as specific lyrics, bass lines, and instruments. Blues can be subdivided into several [[List of blues genres|subgenres]] ranging from [[country blues|country]] to urban blues that were more or less popular during different periods of the 20th century. Best known are the [[Delta blues|Delta]], [[Piedmont blues|Piedmont]], [[Jump blues|Jump]], and [[Chicago blues]] styles. [[World War II]] marked the transition from acoustic to [[electric blues]] and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called [[blues-rock]] evolved.

"The blues takes many forms... It is variously a feeling, a mood, a nameless threat, a person, a lover, a boss man, a mob, and, of course, the Devil himself.  It is often experienced as both cause and effect, action and reaction, and it can be used as both hex and counterhex, poison and antidote, pain and relief. Most importantly, the blues is both the cause of song, and song itself..." <ref>Edward Comentale, p. 49. ''Sweet Air: American Popular Song'', 2013, p[[University of Illinois Press]], ISBN 978-0-252-07892-7</ref>

==Etymology==
One explanation for the origin of the "blues" is that it derived from mysticism involving blue [[indigo]], which was used by many West African cultures in death and mourning ceremonies where all the mourner's garments would have been dyed blue to indicate suffering.{{Citation needed|reason=Blues comes from the 17th century, from the phrase "blue devils" ie. depression, melancholy|date=August 2013}} This mystical association towards the [[Indigofera tinctoria|indigo plant]], grown in many southern U.S. slave plantations, combined with the West African slaves who sang of their suffering as they worked on the cotton that the indigo dyed eventually resulted in these expressed songs being known as "the Blues."<ref>{{citation|first=Cindy|last=Bisaillon|journal=Ideas: with Paul Kennedy|publisher=CBC Radio 1|title=The Power of Colour|number=3|url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2011/11/21/the-power-of-colour-part-1-2-3}}</ref>

The term may also have come from the term "blue devils", meaning melancholy and sadness; an early use of the term in this sense is found in [[George Colman the Younger|George Colman]]'s one-act farce ''Blue Devils'' (1798).<ref>The "Trésor de la Langue Française informatisé" provides this etymology to the word blues and George Colman's farce as the first appearance of this term in the English language, see {{cite web|url=http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/fast.exe?mot=blues|title=Blues|publisher=Centre Nationale de Ressources Textuelles et Lixicales|accessdate=October 15, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5msLYsJNm|archivedate=2010-01-18|deadurl=no}} {{fr icon}}</ref> Though the use of the phrase in [[African-American music]] may be older, it has been attested to since 1912, when [[Hart Wand]]'s "[[Dallas Blues]]" became the first copyrighted blues composition.<ref>Davis, Francis.

New York: Hyperion, 1995.</ref><ref>Eric Partridge, ''A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', 2002, Routledge (UK), ISBN 978-0-415-29189-7</ref> In lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a [[Depression (mood)|depressed mood]].<ref>Tony Bolden, ''Afro-Blue: Improvisations in African American Poetry and Culture'', 2004, [[University of Illinois Press]], ISBN 978-0-252-02874-8</ref>

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of early [[traditional blues verse]]s probably often consisted of a single line repeated four times; it was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the so-called AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars.<ref>Ferris, pg. 230</ref> Two of the first published blues songs, "[[Dallas Blues]]" (1912) and "[[Saint Louis Blues (song)|Saint Louis Blues]]" (1914), were 12-bar blues featuring the AAB structure. [[W. C. Handy]] wrote that he adopted this convention to avoid the monotony of lines repeated three times.<ref>Father of the Blues: An Autobiography. by W.C. Handy, edited by Arna Bontemps: foreword by Abbe Niles. Macmillan Company, New York; (1941) page 143. no ISBN in this first printing</ref>

The lines are often sung following a pattern closer to a [[talking blues|rhythmic talk]] than to a melody. Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative. The singer voiced his or her "personal woes in a world of harsh reality: a lost love, the cruelty of police officers, oppression at the hands of white folk, [and] hard times."<ref>Ewen, pgs. 142–143</ref> This melancholy has led to the suggestion of an [[Igbo music|Igbo]] origin for blues because of the reputation the [[Igbo American|Igbo]] had throughout plantations in the Americas for their melancholic music and outlook to life when they were enslaved.<ref>{{cite book|title=They all played ragtime, the true story of an American music|first1=Rudi|last1=Blesh|first2=Harriet Grossman|last2=Janis|publisher=Sidgwick & Jackson|page=186|year=1958|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=awHY-w8_iTsC&pg=PA186|isbn=978-1-4437-3152-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture: Ethnicity|first1=James G.|last1=Thomas (Jr.)|page=166|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8078-5823-3}}</ref>

The lyrics often relate troubles experienced within African American society. For instance [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]]'s "Rising High Water Blues" (1927) tells about the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]:

: "Backwater rising, Southern peoples can't make no time
: I said, backwater rising, Southern peoples can't make no time
: And I can't get no hearing from that Memphis girl of mine."

However, although the blues gained an association with misery and oppression, the lyrics could also be humorous and raunchy as well:<ref>
Komara, pg. 476
</ref>

: "Rebecca, Rebecca, get your big legs off of me,
: Rebecca, Rebecca, get your big legs off of me,
: It may be sending you baby, but it's worrying the hell out of me."

:: From [[Big Joe Turner]]'s "Rebecca", a compilation of [[traditional blues lyrics]]

[[Hokum]] blues celebrated both comedic lyrical content and a boisterous, [[farcical]] performance style.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge companion to blues and gospel music|author=Allan F. Moore|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-521-00107-6|page=32}}</ref> [[Tampa Red]]'s classic "Tight Like That" (1928) is a sly wordplay with the double meaning of being "tight" with someone coupled with a more salacious physical familiarity. Explicit contents led to blues sometimes being called [[dirty blues]]. Lyrical content of music became slightly simpler in post war-blues which focused almost exclusively on relationship woes or sexual worries. Many lyrical themes that frequently appeared in pre-war blues such as economic depression, farming, devils, gambling, magic, floods and dry periods were less common in post-war blues.<ref>Oliver, pg. 281</ref>

Author Ed Morales has claimed that [[Yoruba mythology]] played a part in early blues, citing [[Robert Johnson]]'s "[[Cross Road Blues]]" as a "thinly veiled reference to [[Eleggua]], the [[orisha]] in charge of the crossroads".<ref name="cgkmik">Morales, pg. 277</ref> However, the Christian influence was far more obvious.<ref>Mark A. Humphrey, in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 107–149</ref> Many seminal blues artists such as [[Charley Patton]] or [[Skip James]] had several religious songs or spirituals in their repertoires.<ref>{{cite album-notes|title=Ten years of black country religion 1926–1936|last=Calt|first=Stephen|coauthors=Nick Perls, Michael Stewart|publisher=[[Yazoo Records]]|publisherid=L-1022|location=New York|format=vinyl back cover|url=http://www.wirz.de/music/yazoo/grafik/1022b4.jpg|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5msLYVAIE|archivedate=2010-01-18|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Reverend Gary Davis]]<ref>{{cite web

==Form==
The blues form is a [[cyclic form|cyclic musical form]] in which a repeating [[chord progression|progression of chords]] mirrors the [[call and response (music)|call and response]] scheme commonly found in African and African-American music. During the first decades of the 20th century blues music was not clearly defined in terms of a particular chord progression.<ref>{{cite web|title=The evolution of the 12-bar blues progression,|url=http://www.bobbrozman.com/tip_evol12bar.html|author=Bob Brozman|authorlink=Bob Brozman|year=2002|accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> With the popularity of early performers, such as [[Bessie Smith]], use of the [[twelve-bar blues]] spread across the music industry during the 1920s and 30s.<ref>[[Samuel Charters]] in Nothing But The Blues, pg. 20.</ref> Other chord progressions, such as [[8-bar blues|8-bar]] forms, are still considered blues; examples include "[[How Long, How Long Blues|How Long Blues]]," "[[Trouble in Mind (song)|Trouble in Mind]]," and [[Big Bill Broonzy]]'s "[[Key to the Highway]]." There are also [[16-bar blues]], as in [[Ray Charles]]'s instrumental "Sweet 16 Bars" and in [[Herbie Hancock]]'s "[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]." Idiosyncratic numbers of bars are also encountered occasionally, as with the 9-bar progression in "[[Sitting on Top of the World]]" by [[Walter Vinson]].

The basic 12-bar lyric framework of a blues composition is reflected by a standard harmonic progression of 12 bars in a [[Time signature|4/4 time signature]]. The blues [[Chord (music)|chords]] associated to a [[twelve-bar blues]] are typically a set of three different chords played over a 12-bar scheme. They are labeled by [[Roman number]]s referring to the [[degree (music)|degrees]] of the progression. For instance, for a blues in the [[key (music)|key]] of C, C is the [[tonic chord]] (I) and F is the [[subdominant chord|subdominant]] (IV).

The last chord is the [[dominant chord|dominant]] (V) [[turnaround (music)|turnaround]], marking the transition to the beginning of the next progression. The lyrics generally end on the last beat of the tenth bar or the first beat of the 11th bar, and the final two bars are given to the instrumentalist as a break; the harmony of this two-bar break, the turnaround, can be extremely complex, sometimes consisting of single notes that defy analysis in terms of chords.

Much of the time, some or all of these chords are played in the [[harmonic seventh]] (7th) form. The use of the harmonic seventh interval is characteristic of blues and is popularly called the "blues seven".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ellen Fullman, "The Long String Instrument", ''MusicWorks'', Issue #37 Fall 1987|url=http://www.deepmedia.org/ellenfullman/mw85/fullman_article.pdf}} {{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> Blues seven chords add to the harmonic chord a note with a frequency in a 7:4 ratio to the fundamental note. At a 7:4 ratio, it is not close to any interval on the conventional Western [[diatonic scale]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Jazz Improvisation Almanac, Outside Shore Music Online School|url=http://www.outsideshore.com/school/music/almanac/html/Music_Theory/Jazz_Scales/Blues_And_Bebop_Scales/Blues_Scale.htm}}</ref> For convenience or by necessity it is often approximated by a [[minor seventh]] interval or a [[dominant seventh]] chord.

[[File:A minor pentatonic scale.svg|thumb|350px|A minor [[pentatonic scale]]; {{Audio|PentMinor.mid|play}}]]

In [[melody]], blues is distinguished by the use of the [[Flat (music)|flattened]] [[minor third|third]], [[tritone|fifth]] and [[minor seventh|seventh]] of the associated [[major scale]].<ref>Ewen, pg. 143</ref> These specialized notes are called the [[blue note|''blue'' or ''bent notes'']]. These scale tones may replace the natural scale tones, or they may be added to the scale, as in the case of the minor blues scale, in which the flattened third replaces the natural third, the flattened seventh replaces the natural seventh and the flattened fifth is added between the natural fourth and natural fifth. While the 12-bar harmonic progression had been intermittently used for centuries, the revolutionary aspect of blues was the frequent use of the flattened third, flattened seventh, and even flattened fifth in the melody, together with ''crushing''—playing directly adjacent notes at the same time (i.e., minor second)—and ''sliding'', similar to using [[grace note]]s.<ref>Grace notes were common in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical music era|Classical]] periods, but they acted as ornamentation rather than as part of the harmonic structure. For example, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Piano Concerto No. 21 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 21]]'' has a flatted fifth in the dominant. In these periods, this was a technique for building tension for resolution into the perfect fifth; in contrast, a blues melody uses the flatted fifth as part of the scale.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}</ref> The blue notes allow for key moments of expression during the cadences, melodies, and embellishments of the blues.

Blues [[shuffle note|shuffles]] or [[walking bass]] reinforce the trance-like rhythm and call-and-response, and they form a repetitive effect called a [[groove (popular music)|groove]]. Characteristic of the blues since its Afro-American origins, the shuffles played a central role in [[swing music]].<ref>Kunzler, pg. 1065</ref> The simplest shuffles, which were the clearest signature of the R&B wave that started in the mid-1940s,<ref>Barry Pearson, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 316</ref> were a three-note [[riff]] on the bass strings of the guitar. When this riff was played over the bass and the drums, the groove "feel" was created. Shuffle rhythm is often vocalized as "''dow'', da ''dow'', da ''dow'', da" or "''dump'', da ''dump'', da ''dump'', da":<ref>David Hamburger, ''Acoustic Guitar Slide Basics'', 2001, ISBN 978-1-890490-38-6.</ref> it consists of uneven, or "swung," eighth notes. On a guitar this may be played as a simple steady bass or it may add to that stepwise quarter note motion from the fifth to the sixth of the chord and back. An example is provided by the following guitar [[tablature]] for the first four bars of a blues progression in E:<ref>{{cite web|title=Lesson 72: Basic Blues Shuffle by Jim Burger|url=http://www.wholenote.com/default.asp?src=l&l=72&p=1|accessdate=November 25, 2005}}</ref><ref>Wilbur M.

===Origins===
{{Main|Origins of the blues}}
The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908: Antonio Maggio's "I Got the Blues" is the first published song to use the word blues. [[Hart Wand]]'s "[[Dallas Blues]]" followed in 1912; [[W. C. Handy]]'s "[[The Memphis Blues]]" followed in the same year. The first recording by an African American singer was [[Mamie Smith]]'s 1920 rendition of [[Perry Bradford]]'s "Crazy Blues". But the origins of the blues date back to some decades earlier, probably around 1890.<ref>David Evans, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 33</ref> They are very poorly documented, due in part to racial discrimination within American society, including academic circles,<ref name="Kunzler, pg. 130">Kunzler, pg. 130</ref> and to the low literacy rate of the rural African American community at the time.<ref>Bruce Bastin, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 206</ref>

Chroniclers began to report about blues music in [[Southern Texas]] and [[Deep South]] at the dawn of the 20th century. In particular, Charles Peabody mentioned the appearance of blues music at [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]] and Gate Thomas reported very similar songs in southern Texas around 1901–1902. These observations coincide more or less with the remembrance of [[Jelly Roll Morton]], who declared having heard blues for the first time in [[New Orleans]] in 1902; [[Ma Rainey]], who remembered her first blues experience the same year in [[Missouri]]; and [[W.C. Handy]], who first heard the blues in [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]] in 1903. The first extensive research in the field was performed by [[Howard W. Odum]], who published a large anthology of folk songs in the counties of [[Lafayette County, Mississippi|Lafayette, Mississippi]] and [[Newton County, Georgia|Newton, Georgia]] between 1905 and 1908.<ref>David Evans, in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 33-35</ref> The first non-commercial recordings of blues music, termed "proto-blues" by [[Paul Oliver]], were made by Odum at the very beginning of the 20th century for research purposes. They are now utterly lost.<ref>John H. Cowley, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 265</ref>

Other recordings that are still available were made in 1924 by [[Lawrence Gellert]]. Later, several recordings were made by [[Robert Winslow Gordon|Robert W. Gordon]], who became head of the [[Archive of Folk Culture|Archive of American Folk Songs]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. Gordon's successor at the Library was [[John Lomax]]. In the 1930s, together with his son [[Alan Lomax|Alan]], Lomax made a large number of non-commercial blues recordings that testify to the huge variety of proto-blues styles, such as [[field holler]]s and [[ring shout]]s.<ref>John H. Cowley, in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 268-269</ref> A record of blues music as it existed before the 1920s is also given by the recordings of artists such as [[Lead Belly]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leadbelly.org/re-homepage.html|title=Lead Belly foundation|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> or [[Henry Thomas (blues musician)|Henry Thomas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/TT/fthxc.html|title=Henry Thomas|author=Dave Oliphant|work=The Handbook of Texas online|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> who both performed archaic blues music. All these sources show the existence of many different structures distinct from the [[12 bar blues|twelve-]], [[eight-bar blues|eight-]], or [[16 bar blues|sixteen-bar]].<ref>Garofalo, pgs. 46–47</ref><ref>Oliver, pg. 3</ref>

[[File:John Lomax.jpg|thumb|[[John Lomax]], pioneering [[musicologist]] and [[folklorist]].]]
The social and economic reasons for the appearance of the blues are not fully known.<ref>Philip V.

Several scholars characterize the early 1900s development of blues music as a move from group performances to a more individualized style. They argue that the development of the blues is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the enslaved people.<ref name="Lawrence W. Levine 1977, pg. 223">Lawrence W. Levine, ''Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1977, ISBN 978-0-19-502374-9, pg. 223</ref>

According to Lawrence Levine, "there was a direct relationship between the national ideological emphasis upon the individual, the popularity of [[Booker T. Washington]]'s teachings, and the rise of the blues." Levine states that "psychologically, socially, and economically, African-Americans were being acculturated in a way that would have been impossible during slavery, and it is hardly surprising that their secular music reflected this as much as their religious music did."<ref name="Lawrence W. Levine 1977, pg. 223"/>

There are few characteristics common to all blues music, because the genre took its shape from the idiosyncrasies of individual performances.<ref>Southern, pg. 333</ref> However, there are some characteristics that were present long before the creation of the modern blues. Call-and-response shouts were an early form of blues-like music; they were a "functional expression ... style without accompaniment or harmony and unbounded by the formality of any particular musical structure."<ref>Garofalo, pg. 44</ref> A form of this pre-blues was heard in slave [[ring shout]]s and [[field holler]]s, expanded into "simple solo songs laden with emotional content".<ref>Ferris, pg. 229</ref>

Blues has evolved from the unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves imported from West Africa and rural blacks into a wide variety of styles and subgenres, with regional variations across the United States. Though blues, as it is now known, can be seen as a musical style based on both European [[harmony|harmonic structure]] and the African call-and-response tradition, transformed into an interplay of voice and guitar,<ref>Morales, pg. 276 Morales attributes this claim to [[John Storm Roberts]] in ''Black Music of Two Worlds'', beginning his discussion with a quote from Roberts: "There does not seem to be the same African quality in blues forms as there clearly is in much Caribbean music."</ref><ref name="Call and Response in Blues">{{cite web|title=Call and Response in Blues|publisher=How To Play Blues Guitar|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://how-to-play-blues-guitar.com/blues-concepts/call-and-response/}}</ref> the blues form itself bears no resemblance to the melodic styles of the West African [[griot]]s, and the influences are faint and tenuous.<ref>[[Samuel Charters]], in Nothing But the Blues, page 25</ref><ref>Oliver, pg. 4</ref>

In particular, no specific African musical form can be identified as the single direct ancestor of the blues.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Curious Listener's Guide to the Blues|author=Barbara Vierwo, Andy Trudeau|publisher=Stone Press|isbn=978-0-399-53072-2|page=15}}</ref> However many blues elements, such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes, can be traced back to the [[music of Africa]]. That blue notes pre-date their use in blues and have an African origin is attested by English composer [[Samuel Coleridge-Taylor]]'s "A Negro Love Song", from his ''The African Suite for Piano'' composed in 1898, which contains [[minor third|blue third]] and [[seventh chord|seventh notes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=From the Erotic to the Demonic: On Critical Musicology.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|page=182|quote=A blues idiom is hinted at in "A Negro Love-Song", a pentatonic melody with blue third and seventh in Colridge-Taylor's ''African Suit'' of 1898, many years before the first blues publications.|authorlink4=Derek B.|authormask=Scott}}</ref>

The [[Diddley bow]] (a homemade one-stringed instrument found in parts of the [[American South]] in the early twentieth century) and the [[banjo]] are African-derived instruments that may have helped in the transfer of African performance techniques into the early blues instrumental vocabulary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF1902/Steber/Steber.html|title=African-American Music from the Mississippi Hill Country: "They Say Drums was a-Calling"|publisher=The APF Reporter|author=Bill Steper|year=1999|accessdate=2008-10-27}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> The banjo seems to be directly imported from western African music.

Blues music also adopted elements from the "Ethiopian airs", [[minstrel show]]s and [[Negro spiritual]]s, including instrumental and harmonic accompaniment.<ref>Garofalo, pg. 44 ''Gradually, instrumental and harmonic accompaniment were added, reflecting increasing cross-cultural contact.'' Garofalo cites other authors that also mention the "Ethiopian airs" and "Negro spirituals".</ref> The style also was closely related to [[ragtime]], which developed at about the same time, though the blues better preserved "the original melodic patterns of African music."<ref>Schuller, cited in Garofalo, pg. 27</ref>

[[File:Charley-Patton-002.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Charley Patton]], one of the originators of the Delta blues style, playing with a [[plectrum|pick]] or a [[Slide guitar|bottleneck slide]].]]
The musical forms and styles that are now considered the "blues" as well as modern "[[country music]]" arose in the same regions during the 19th century in the southern United States. Recorded blues and country can be found from as far back as the 1920s, when the popular record industry developed and created marketing categories called "[[race music]]" and "[[hillbilly music]]" to sell music by blacks for blacks and by whites for whites, respectively. At the time, there was no clear musical division between "blues" and "country," except for the ethnicity of the performer, and even that was sometimes documented incorrectly by record companies.<ref>Garofalo, pgs. 44–47 "As marketing categories, designations like race and hillbilly intentionally separated artists along racial lines and conveyed the impression that their music came from mutually exclusive sources. Nothing could have been further from the truth... In cultural terms, blues and country were more equal than they were separate." Garofalo claims that "artists were sometimes listed in the wrong racial category in record company catalogues."</ref><ref>Charles Wolfe in Nothing but the Blues, pgs. 233–263</ref>

Though musicologists can now attempt to define "the blues" narrowly in terms of certain chord structures and lyric strategies thought to have originated in West Africa, audiences originally heard the music in a far more general way: it was simply the music of the rural south, notably the Mississippi Delta. Black and white musicians shared the same repertoire and thought of themselves as "[[songsters]]" rather than "blues musicians." The notion of blues as a separate genre arose during the black migration from the countryside to urban areas in the 1920s and the simultaneous development of the recording industry. "Blues" became a code word for a record designed to sell to black listeners.<ref>{{cite web|last=Golding|first=Barrett|title=The Rise of the Country Blues|publisher=NPR|url=http://www.honkytonks.org/showpages/countryblues.htm|accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref>

The origins of the blues are closely related to the religious music of the Afro-American community, the [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]]. The origins of spirituals go back much further than the blues, usually dating back to the middle of the 18th century, when the slaves were Christianized and began to sing and play Christian [[hymn]]s, in particular those of [[Isaac Watts]], which were very popular.<ref>Mark A. Humphrey in Nothing but the blues, pg. 110</ref> Before the blues gained its formal definition in terms of chord progressions, it was defined as the secular counterpart of the spirituals. It was the low-down music played by the rural Blacks.<ref name="ReferenceA">Mark A. Humphrey in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 107-149</ref>

Depending on the religious community a musician belonged to, it was more or less considered as a sin to play this low-down music: blues was the devil's music. Musicians were therefore segregated into two categories: gospel and blues singers, guitar preachers and songsters. However, at the time rural Black music began to get recorded in the 1920s, both categories of musicians used very similar techniques: call-and-response patterns, blue notes, and slide guitars. Gospel music was nevertheless using musical forms that were compatible with Christian hymns and therefore less marked by the blues form than its secular counterpart.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Pre-war blues===
The American [[sheet music]] publishing industry produced a great deal of [[ragtime]] music. By 1912, the sheet music industry had published three popular blues-like compositions, precipitating the [[Tin Pan Alley]] adoption of blues elements: "Baby Seals' Blues" by "Baby" F. Seals (arranged by [[Artie Matthews]]), "Dallas Blues" by [[Hart Wand]] and "[[The Memphis Blues]]" by [[W. C. Handy]].<ref>Garofalo, pg. 27; Garofalo cites Barlow in "Handy's sudden success demonstrated [the] commercial potential of [the blues], which in turn made the genre attractive to the Tin Pan Alley hacks, who wasted little time in turning out a deluge of imitations." (parentheticals in Garofalo)</ref>

[[File:Partitura.jpg|thumb|200px|Sheet music from "[[Saint Louis Blues (song)|Saint Louis Blues]]" (1914)]]
Handy was a formally trained musician, composer and arranger who helped to popularize the blues by transcribing and orchestrating blues in an almost symphonic style, with bands and singers. He became a popular and prolific composer, and billed himself as the "Father of the Blues"; however, his compositions can be described as a fusion of blues with ragtime and jazz, a merger facilitated using the Cuban [[habanera (music)|habanera]] rhythm that had long been a part of ragtime;<ref name="cgkmik"/><ref name="trkeja">Garofalo, pg. 27</ref> Handy's signature work was the "[[Saint Louis Blues (song)|Saint Louis Blues]]".

In the 1920s, the blues became a major element of African American and American popular music, reaching white audiences via Handy's arrangements and the classic female blues performers. The blues evolved from informal performances in bars to entertainment in theaters. Blues performances were organized by the [[Theater Owners Bookers Association]] in [[nightclub]]s such as the [[Cotton Club]] and [[juke joint]]s such as the bars along [[Beale Street]] in Memphis. Several record companies, such as the [[American Record Corporation]], [[Okeh Records]], and [[Paramount Records]], began to record African American music.

As the recording industry grew, country blues performers like [[Bo Carter]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)]], [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], [[Tampa Red]] and [[Blind Blake]] became more popular in the African American community. Kentucky-born [[Sylvester Weaver]] was in 1923 the first to record the [[slide guitar]] style, in which a guitar is fretted with a knife blade or the sawed-off neck of a bottle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aye.net/~kbsblues/awards.htm#Weaver|title=Kentuckiana Blues Society|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> The slide guitar became an important part of the [[Delta blues]].<ref name="bkihns">Clarke, pg. 138</ref> The first blues recordings from the 1920s are categorized as a traditional, rural [[country blues]] and a more polished 'city' or urban blues.

Country blues performers often improvised, either without accompaniment or with only a banjo or guitar. Regional styles of country blues varied widely in the early 20th century. The (Mississippi) Delta blues was a rootsy sparse style with passionate vocals accompanied by slide guitar. The little-recorded [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]<ref>Clarke, pg. 141</ref> combined elements of urban and rural blues. In addition to Robert Johnson, influential performers of this style included his predecessors [[Charley Patton]] and [[Son House]]. Singers such as [[Blind Willie McTell]] and [[Blind Boy Fuller]] performed in the southeastern "delicate and lyrical" [[Piedmont blues]] tradition, which used an elaborate ragtime-based [[fingerpicking]] guitar technique. Georgia also had an early slide tradition,<ref>Clarke, pg. 139</ref> with [[Curley Weaver]], [[Tampa Red]], [[Barbecue Bob|"Barbecue Bob" Hicks]] and [[Kokomo Arnold|James "Kokomo" Arnold]] as representatives of this style.<ref>{{cite album-notes|title=The Georgia Blues 1927–1933|last=Calt|first=Stephen|coauthors=Nick Perls, Michael Stewart|publisher=[[Yazoo Records]]|publisherid=L-1012|location=New York|format=vinyl back cover|url=http://www.wirz.de/music/yazoo/grafik/1012b4.jpg}}</ref>

The lively [[Memphis blues]] style, which developed in the 1920s and 1930s near [[Memphis, Tennessee]], was influenced by [[jug band]]s such as the [[Memphis Jug Band]] or the [[Gus Cannon|Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers]]. Performers such as [[Frank Stokes (musician)|Frank Stokes]], [[Sleepy John Estes]], [[Robert Wilkins]], [[Joe McCoy]], [[Casey Bill Weldon]] and [[Memphis Minnie]] used a variety of unusual instruments such as [[washboard]], [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddle]], [[kazoo]] or [[mandolin]]. Memphis Minnie was famous for her [[virtuoso]] guitar style. Pianist [[Memphis Slim]] began his career in Memphis, but his distinct style was smoother and had some swing elements. Many blues musicians based in Memphis moved to Chicago in the late 1930s or early 1940s and became part of the urban blues movement, which blended country music and electric blues.<ref>{{cite album-notes|title=10 Years In Memphis 1927–1937|last=Kent|first=Don|authorlink=Don Kent (collector)|publisher=[[Yazoo Records]]|publisherid=L-1002|year=1968|location=New York|format=vinyl back cover|url=http://www.wirz.de/music/yazoo/grafik/1002b4.jpg}}</ref><ref>{{cite album-notes|title=Memphis Jamboree 1927–1936|last=Calt|first=Stephen|coauthors=Nick Perls, Michael Stewart|publisher=[[Yazoo Records]]|publisherid=L-1021|year=1970|location=New York|format=vinyl back cover

[[File:Bessiesmith.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Bessie Smith]], an early blues singer, was known for her powerful voice.]]

==== Urban blues ====
City or urban blues styles were more codified and elaborate as a performer was no longer within their local, immediate community and had to adapt to a larger, more varied audience's aesthetic.<ref name="qzdblv">Garofalo, pg. 47</ref> [[classic female blues|Classic female urban]] and [[vaudeville]] blues singers were popular in the 1920s, among them [[Mamie Smith]], [[Gertrude Ma Rainey|Gertrude "Ma" Rainey]], [[Bessie Smith]], and [[Victoria Spivey]]. Mamie Smith, more a vaudeville performer than a blues artist, was the first African-American to record a blues in 1920; her second record, "Crazy Blues", sold 75,000 copies in its first month.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hawkeye Herman|title=Blues Foundation homepage|publisher=Blues Foundation|url=http://www.blues.org/blues/essays.php4?Id=3|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>

[[Ma Rainey]], the "Mother of Blues", and Bessie Smith each "[sang] around center tones, perhaps in order to project her voice more easily to the back of a room." Smith would "... sing a song in an unusual key, and her artistry in bending and stretching notes with her beautiful, powerful contralto to accommodate her own interpretation was unsurpassed."<ref>Clarke, pg. 137</ref> Urban male performers included popular black musicians of the era, such [[Tampa Red]], [[Big Bill Broonzy]] and [[Leroy Carr]]. An important label of this era was the chicagoean [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label. Before WWII, Tampa Red was sometimes referred to as "the Guitar Wizard". Carr accompanied himself on the piano with [[Scrapper Blackwell]] on guitar, a format that continued well into the 50s with people such as [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]], and even [[Nat "King" Cole]].<ref name="bkihns"/>

[[File:Boogie-woogie-bassline.svg|thumb|200px|A typical boogie-woogie bassline]]
[[boogie-woogie (music)|Boogie-woogie]] was another important style of 1930s and early 1940s urban blues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scaruffi.com/history/blues.html|title=A brief history of Blues Music|author=Piero Scaruffi|year=2005|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref> While the style is often associated with solo piano, boogie-woogie was also used to accompany singers and, as a solo part, in bands and small combos. Boogie-Woogie style was characterized by a regular bass figure, an [[ostinato]] or [[riff]] and [[shift of level|shifts of level]] in the left hand, elaborating each chord and trills and decorations in the right hand. Boogie-woogie was pioneered by the Chicago-based [[Jimmy Yancey]] and the Boogie-Woogie Trio ([[Albert Ammons]], [[Pete Johnson]] and [[Meade Lux Lewis]]).<ref>{{cite album-notes|title=Boogie Woogie Trio|last=Oliver|first=Paul|publisher=Storyville|publisherid=SLP 184|location=Copenhagen|format=vinyl back cover}}</ref> Chicago boogie-woogie performers included [[Pinetop Smith|Clarence "Pine Top" Smith]] and [[Earl Hines]], who "linked the propulsive left-hand rhythms of the ragtime pianists with melodic figures similar to those of Armstrong's trumpet in the right hand."<ref name="qzdblv"/> The smooth Louisiana style of [[Professor Longhair]] and, more recently, [[Dr. John]] blends classic rhythm and blues with blues styles.

Another development in this period was [[big band]] blues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scaruffi.com/history/jazz7.html|author=Piero Scaruffi|title=Kansas City: Big Bands|year=2003|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> The "[[territory band]]s" operating out of [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]], the [[Bennie Moten]] orchestra, [[Jay McShann]], and the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] were also concentrating on the blues, with 12-bar blues instrumentals such as Basie's "[[One O'Clock Jump]]" and "[[Jumpin' at the Woodside]]" and boisterous "[[blues shouter|blues shouting]]" by [[Jimmy Rushing]] on songs such as "Going to Chicago" and "[[Sent for You Yesterday]]." A well-known big band blues tune is [[Glenn Miller]]'s "[[In the Mood]]." In the 1940s, the [[jump blues]] style developed. Jump blues grew up from the boogie woogie wave and was strongly influenced by [[big band]] music. It uses [[saxophone]] or other [[brass instrument]]s and the guitar in the rhythm section to create a jazzy, up-tempo sound with declamatory vocals. Jump blues tunes by [[Louis Jordan]] and [[Big Joe Turner]], based in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], influenced the development of later styles such as [[rock and roll]] and [[rhythm and blues]].<ref>Garofalo, pg. 76</ref> Dallas-born [[T-Bone Walker]], who is often associated with the [[West Coast blues|California blues]] style,<ref>Komara, pg. 120</ref> performed a successful transition from the early urban blues à la [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]] and [[Leroy Carr]] to the jump blues style and dominated the blues-jazz scene at [[Los Angeles]] during the 1940s.<ref>Mark A. Humphrey, in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 175-177</ref>

===1950s===
The transition from country to urban blues, that began in the 1920s, had always been driven by the successive waves of economic crisis and booms and the associated move of the rural Blacks to urban areas, the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. The [[post-World War II boom|long boom]] in the aftermath of World War II induced a massive migration of the African American population, the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]], which was accompanied by a significant increase of the real income of the urban Blacks. The new migrants constituted a new market for the music industry. The name [[race record]] disappeared and was succeeded by [[Rhythm and Blues]]. This rapidly evolving market was mirrored by the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[List of number-one rhythm and blues hits (United States)|Rhythm and Blues Chart]]. This marketing strategy reinforced trends within urban blues music such as the progressive electrification of the instruments, their amplification and the generalization of the blues beat, the blues shuffle, that became ubiquitous in R&B. This commercial stream had important consequences for blues music which, together with Jazz and Gospel music, became a component of the R&B wave.<ref>Barry Pearson in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 313-314</ref>

[[Little Walter]] and [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller)]] are well known harmonica (called "[[Harmonica techniques#Blues harp (2nd position)|harp]]" by blues musicians) players of the early Chicago blues scene. Other harp players such as [[Big Walter Horton]] were also influential. Muddy Waters and Elmore James were known for their innovative use of slide electric guitar. Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters were known for their deep, "gravelly" voices.

Bassist and composer [[Willie Dixon]] played a major role on the Chicago blues scene. He composed and wrote many [[blues standard|standard blues]] songs of the period, such as "[[Hoochie Coochie Man]]," "[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]" (both penned for Muddy Waters) and, "[[Wang Dang Doodle]]" and "[[Back Door Man]]" for Howlin' Wolf. Most artists of the Chicago blues style recorded for the Chicago-based [[Chess Records]] and [[Checker Records]] labels. Smaller blues labels of this era included [[Vee-Jay Records]] and [[J.O.B. Records]]. During the early 1950s, the dominating Chicago labels were challenged by [[Sam Phillips]]' [[Sun Records]] company in Memphis, which recorded [[B. B. King]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]] before he moved to Chicago in 1960.<ref>Mark A. Humphrey, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 187</ref> After Phillips discovered [[Elvis Presley]] in 1954, the Sun label turned to the rapidly expanding white audience and started recording mostly rock 'n' roll.<ref>Barry Pearson, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 342</ref>

In the 1950s, blues had a huge influence on mainstream American popular music. While popular musicians like [[Bo Diddley]]<ref name="Herzhaft, pg. 53"/> and [[Chuck Berry]],<ref>Herzhaft, pg. 11</ref> both recording for Chess, were influenced by the Chicago blues, their enthusiastic playing styles departed from the melancholy aspects of blues. Chicago blues also influenced [[Louisiana]]'s [[zydeco]] music,<ref>Herzhaft, pg. 236</ref> with [[Clifton Chenier]]<ref>Herzhaft, pg. 35</ref> using blues accents. Zydeco musicians used electric solo guitar and [[cajun]] arrangements of blues standards.

Overseas, in England, electric blues took root there during a much acclaimed Muddy Waters tour. Waters, unsuspecting of his audience's tendency towards [[skiffle]], an acoustic, softer brand of blues, turned up his amp and started to play his Chicago brand of electric blues. Although the audience was largely jolted by the performance, the performance influenced local musicians such as [[Alexis Korner]] and [[Cyril Davies]] to emulate this louder style, inspiring the [[British invasion]] of the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds.<ref>Palmer (1981), pgs. 257–259</ref>

In the late 1950s, a new blues style emerged on Chicago's [[Neighborhoods of Chicago|West Side]] pioneered by [[Magic Sam]], [[Buddy Guy]] and [[Otis Rush]] on [[Cobra Records]].<ref>Koroma, pg. 49</ref> The 'West Side Sound' had strong rhythmic support from a rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums and as pefected by Guy, [[Freddie King]], [[Magic Slim]] and [[Luther Allison]] was dominated by amplified electric lead guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/151.html|title=Blues|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=West Side Chicago Blues|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=11835|work=All about Jazz|author=C.

Other blues artists, such as [[John Lee Hooker]] had influences not directly related to the Chicago style. John Lee Hooker's blues is more "personal," based on Hooker's deep rough voice accompanied by a single electric guitar. Though not directly influenced by boogie woogie, his "groovy" style is sometimes called "guitar boogie". His first hit, "[[Boogie Chillen]]," reached #1 on the R&B charts in 1949.<ref>Lars Bjorn, ''Before Motown'', 2001, [[University of Michigan]] Press, ISBN 978-0-472-06765-7, pg. 175</ref>

By the late 1950s, the [[swamp blues]] genre developed near [[Baton Rouge]], with performers such as [[Lightnin' Slim]],<ref>Herzhaft, pg 116</ref> [[Slim Harpo]],<ref>Herzhaft, pg. 188</ref> [[Sam Myers]] and [[Jerry McCain]] around the producer [[J. D. "Jay" Miller]] and the [[Excello Records|Excello]] label. Strongly influenced by [[Jimmy Reed]], Swamp blues has a slower pace and a simpler use of the harmonica than the Chicago blues style performers such as Little Walter or Muddy Waters. Songs from this genre include "Scratch my Back", "She's Tough" and "[[I'm a King Bee]]." Alan Lomax's recordings of [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]] would eventually bring him wider attention on both the blues and folk circuit, with McDowell's droning style influencing [[North Mississippi hill country blues]] musicians.<ref name="msbluestrail1">{{cite web|url=http://www.msbluestrail.org/_webapp_1964090/Hill_Country_Blues|title=Hill Country Blues|publisher=Msbluestrail.org|accessdate=2011-09-13}}</ref>

===1960s and 1970s===
By the beginning of the 1960s, genres influenced by [[African American music]] such as [[rock and roll]] and [[soul music|soul]] were part of mainstream popular music. White performers had brought African-American music to new audiences, both within the U.S. and abroad. However, the blues wave that brought artists such as Muddy Waters to the foreground had stopped. Bluesmen such as [[Big Bill Broonzy]] and [[Willie Dixon]] started looking for new markets in Europe. [[Dick Waterman]] and the blues festivals he organized in Europe played a major role in propagating blues music abroad. In the UK, bands emulated U.S. blues legends, and UK blues-rock-based bands had an influential role throughout the 1960s.<ref>Jim O'Neal in Nothing but the blues, pgs 347–387</ref>

[[File:B. B. King.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Blues legend [[B.B. King]] with his guitar, "Lucille".]]
Blues performers such as [[John Lee Hooker]] and [[Muddy Waters]] continued to perform to enthusiastic audiences, inspiring new artists steeped in traditional blues, such as New York–born [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]]. [[John Lee Hooker]] blended his blues style with rock elements and playing with younger white musicians, creating a musical style that can be heard on the 1971 album ''Endless Boogie''. [[B. B. King]]'s virtuoso guitar technique earned him the eponymous title "king of the blues".

In contrast to the Chicago style, King's band used strong brass support from a saxophone, trumpet, and trombone, instead of using slide guitar or harp. [[Tennessee]]-born [[Bobby Bland|Bobby "Blue" Bland]], like B. B. King, also straddled the blues and R&B genres. During this period, Freddie King and Albert King often played with rock and soul musicians ([[Eric Clapton]], [[Booker T & the MGs]]) and had a major influence on those styles of music.

The music of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights]]<ref name="Koroma, pg. 122">Koroma, pg. 122</ref> and [[Free Speech Movement|Free Speech]] movements in the U.S. prompted a [[American folk music revival|resurgence of interest in American roots music and early African American music]]. As well as Jimmi Bass Music festivals such as the [[Newport Folk Festival]]<ref>Koroma, pg. 388</ref> brought traditional blues to a new audience, which helped to revive interest in prewar acoustic blues and performers such as [[Son House]], [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Skip James]], and [[Reverend Gary Davis]].<ref name="Koroma, pg. 122"/> Many compilations of classic prewar blues were republished by the [[Yazoo Records]]. [[J. B. Lenoir]] from the Chicago blues movement in the 1950s recorded several LPs using acoustic guitar, sometimes accompanied by [[Willie Dixon]] on the acoustic bass or drums. His songs, originally distributed in Europe only,<ref>Jim O'Neal, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 380</ref> commented on political issues such as [[racism]] or [[Vietnam War]] issues, which was unusual for this period. His ''Alabama Blues'' recording had a song that stated:

<blockquote>
I never will go back to Alabama, that is not the place for me (2x)<br />
You know they killed my sister and my brother,<br />
and the whole world let them peoples go down there free
</blockquote>

White audiences' interest in the blues during the 1960s increased due to the Chicago-based [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]] and the [[British blues]] movement. The style of British blues developed in the UK, when bands such as [[The Animals]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Yardbirds]], and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and Irish musician [[Rory Gallagher]] performed classic blues songs from the [[Delta blues|Delta]] or [[Chicago blues]] traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/blues.htm|title=A Short Blues History|work=History of Rock|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref>

The British and blues musicians of the early 1960s inspired a number of American [[blues rock]] fusion performers, including [[Canned Heat]], the early [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Johnny Winter]], [[The J. Geils Band]], [[Ry Cooder]], and The [[Allman Brothers Band]]. One [[blues rock]] performer, [[Jimi Hendrix]], was a rarity in his field at the time: a black man who played [[psychedelic rock]]. Hendrix was a skilled guitarist, and a pioneer in the innovative use of [[distortion]] and [[feedback]] in his music.<ref>Garofalo, pgs. 224–225</ref> Through these artists and others, blues music influenced the development of [[rock music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infernality.blogspot.com/2006/09/origins-and-early-popularity-1960s-and.html|title=History of heavy metal: Origins and early popularity (1960s and early 1970s)|date=2006-09-18|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

[[Santana (band)|Santana]], which was originally called the ''Carlos Santana Blues Band'', also experimented with [[Latin music|Latin]]-influenced blues and blues-rock music around this time. At the end of the 1950s appeared the very bluesy [[The Tulsa Sound|Tulsa Sound]] merging rock'n'roll, jazz and country influences. This particular music style started to be broadly popularized within the 1970s by [[J.J. Cale]] and the cover versions performed by [[Eric Clapton]] of "[[After Midnight (song)|After Midnight]]" and "[[Cocaine (song)|Cocaine]]".

In the early 1970s, The [[Texas blues|Texas rock-blues style]] emerged, which used guitars in both solo and rhythm roles. In contrast with the West Side blues, the Texas style is strongly influenced by the British rock-blues movement. Major artists of the Texas style are [[Johnny Winter]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]], and [[ZZ Top]]. These artists all began their musical journey in the 1970s, but they did not achieve major international success until the next decade.<ref>Koroma, pg. 50</ref>

===1980s to the 2000s===
[[File:Svaughan.jpg|thumb|175px|Texas blues guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]]]
Since at least the 1980s, there has been a resurgence of interest in the blues among a certain part of the African-American population, particularly around [[Jackson, Mississippi]] and other [[deep South]] regions. Often termed "[[soul blues]]" or "[[Southern soul]]", the music at the heart of this movement was given new life by the unexpected success of two particular recordings on the Jackson-based [[Malaco Records|Malaco]] label:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmississippi.org/press_news/Malaco%20Blues%20Marker%20April%208.pdf|title=Malaco Records to be honored with blues trail marker|author=Stephen Martin|publisher=Mississippi development authority|date=2008-04-03|accessdate=2008-08-28}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[Z. Z. Hill]]'s ''Down Home Blues'' (1982) and [[Little Milton]]'s ''The Blues is Alright'' (1984). Contemporary African-American performers who work this vein of the blues include [[Bobby Rush (musician)|Bobby Rush]], [[Denise LaSalle]], [[Sir Charles Jones]], [[Bettye LaVette]], [[Marvin Sease]], [[Peggy Scott-Adams]], Mel Waiters, [[Clarence Carter]], Dr. "Feelgood" Potts, O.B. Buchana, Ms. Jody, [[Shirley Brown]], and dozens of others.

During the 1980s, blues also continued in both traditional and new forms. In 1986, the album ''[[Strong Persuader]]'' revealed [[Robert Cray]] as a major blues artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scaruffi.com/history/cpt416.html|title=The History of Rock Music: 1976–1989, Blues, 1980-81|author=Piero Scaruffi|year=2005|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref> The first [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] recording, ''[[Texas Flood]]'', was released in 1983, and the Texas-based guitarist exploded onto the international stage. 1989 saw a revival of [[John Lee Hooker]]'s popularity with the album ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]''. [[Eric Clapton]], known for his performances with [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers|the Blues Breakers]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]], made a comeback in the 1990s with his album ''[[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Unplugged]]'', in which he played some standard blues numbers on acoustic guitar. However, beginning in the 1990s, [[digital recording|digital multitrack recording]] and other technological advances and new marketing strategies that include [[video clip]] production have increased costs, and challenge the spontaneity and improvisation that are an important component of blues music.<ref>Mary Katherine Aldin, in ''Nothing but the blues'', pg. 130</ref>

In the 1980s and 1990s, blues publications such as ''[[Living Blues]]'' and ''Blues Revue'' began to be distributed, major cities began forming blues societies, outdoor blues festivals became more common, and<ref>A directory of the most significant blues festivals can be found at {{cite web|url=http://blues.about.com/od/bluesfestivals/|title=Blues - By Category|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> more [[nightclub]]s and venues for blues emerged.<ref>A list of important blues venues in the U.S. can be found at {{cite web|url=http://blues.about.com/cs/venues/|title=About.com|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>

In the 1990s, largely ignored [[hill country blues]] gained minor recognition in both blues and [[alternative rock]] music circles with North Mississippi artists [[R. L. Burnside]] and [[Junior Kimbrough]].<ref name="msbluestrail1"/> Blues performers explored a range of musical genres, as can be seen, for example, from the broad array of nominees of the yearly [[Blues Music Awards]], previously named W. C. Handy Awards<ref>{{cite web|title=Blues Music Awards information|url=http://www.blues.org/bluesmusicawards/|accessdate=November 25, 2005}}</ref> or of the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album|Grammy Awards for Best Contemporary]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album|Traditional Blues Album]]. The [[List of number-one blues albums|Bilboard Blues Album chart]] monitors and therefore provides an overview over the current blues production. Contemporary blues music is nurtured by several blues labels such as: [[Alligator Records]], [[Ruf Records]], [[Severn Records]], [[Chess Records]] ([[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]), [[Delmark Records]], [[NorthernBlues Music]], [[Fat Possum Records]] and [[Vanguard Records]] (Artemis Records). Some labels are famous for their rediscovering and remastering of blues rarities such as [[Arhoolie Records]], [[Smithsonian Folkways Recordings]] (heir of [[Folkways Records]]) and [[Yazoo Records]] ([[Shanachie Records]]).<ref>A complete directory of contemporary blues labels can be found at {{cite web|url=http://blues.about.com/cs/recordlabels|title=About.com|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}/</ref>

==Musical impact==
Blues musical styles, forms (12-bar blues), melodies, and the blues scale have influenced many other genres of music, such as rock and roll, jazz, and popular music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.googobits.com/articles/p6-2006-the-blues--the-revolution-of-music.html|title=The Blues: The Revolution of Music|author=Jennifer Nicole|date=2005-08-15|accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref> Prominent jazz, folk or rock performers, such as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Miles Davis]], and [[Bob Dylan]] have performed significant blues recordings. The blues scale is often used in [[popular song]]s like [[Harold Arlen]]'s "Blues in the Night", [[blues ballad]]s like "Since I Fell for You" and "Please Send Me Someone to Love", and even in orchestral works such as [[George Gershwin]]'s "[[Rhapsody in Blue]]" and "Concerto in F". Gershwin's second "Prelude" for solo piano is an interesting example of a classical blues, maintaining the form with academic strictness. The blues scale is ubiquitous in modern popular music and informs many [[modal frame]]s, especially the [[ladder of thirds]] used in rock music (for example, in "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]"). Blues forms are used in the theme to the televised ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', [[teen idol]] [[Fabian Forte]]'s hit, "Turn Me Loose", [[country music]] star [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]' music, and guitarist/vocalist [[Tracy Chapman]]'s hit "Give Me One Reason".

Early country bluesmen such as [[Skip James]], [[Charley Patton]], [[Georgia Tom Dorsey]] played country and urban blues and had influences from spiritual singing. Dorsey helped to popularize [[Gospel music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afgen.com/gospel1.html|title=History of gospel music|author=Phil Petrie|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref> Gospel music developed in the 1930s, with the [[Golden Gate Quartet]]. In the 1950s, [[soul music]] by [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[James Brown]] used gospel and blues music elements. In the 1960s and 1970s, gospel and blues were these merged in [[soul blues]] music. [[Funk]] music of the 1970s was influenced by soul; funk can be seen as an antecedent of hip-hop and contemporary R&B.

[[R&B]] music can be traced back to [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] and blues. Musically, spirituals were a descendant of [[New England]] choral traditions, and in particular of [[Isaac Watts]]'s [[hymn]]s, mixed with African rhythms and call-and-response forms. Spirituals or religious chants in the African-American community are much better documented than the "low-down" blues. Spiritual singing developed because African-American communities could gather for mass or worship gatherings, which were called [[camp meeting]]s.

Edward P. Comentale has noted how the blues was often used as a medium for art or self-expression, stating: "As heard from Delta shacks to Chicago tenements to Harlem cabarets, the blues proved&mdash;despite its pained origins&mdash;a remarkably flexible medium and a new arena for the shaping of identity and community."<ref>{{cite book|last=comentale|first=Edward|title=Sweet Air|year=2013|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0-252-07892-7|page=31}}</ref>

[[File:Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club 1943.jpg|thumb|[[Duke Ellington]] straddled the [[big band]] and [[bebop]] genres. Ellington extensively used the blues form.<ref name=monk>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzinamerica.org/pdf/1/Influence%20of%20Jazz%20on%20Blues.pdf|title=The Influence of the Blues on Jazz|publisher=Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz|accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref>]]

Before [[World War II]], the boundaries between blues and [[jazz]] were less clear. Usually jazz had harmonic structures stemming from [[brass band]]s, whereas blues had blues forms such as the 12-bar blues. However, the jump blues of the 1940s mixed both styles. After WWII, blues had a substantial influence on jazz. [[Bebop]] classics, such as [[Charlie Parker]]'s "Now's the Time", used the blues form with the pentatonic scale and blue notes.

Bebop marked a major shift in the role of jazz, from a popular style of music for dancing, to a "high-art," less-accessible, cerebral "musician's music". The audience for both blues and jazz split, and the border between blues and jazz became more defined.<ref name=monk/><ref>{{cite book|title=Roots of the Classical: The Popular Origins of Western Music|author=Peter Van der Merwe|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-19-816647-4|page=461}}</ref>

The blues' 12-bar structure and the blues scale was a major influence on [[rock and roll]] music. Rock and roll has been called "blues with a [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]"; [[Carl Perkins]] called [[rockabilly]] "blues with a [[country music|country]] beat". Rockabillies were also said to be 12-bar blues played with a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] beat. "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]", with its unmodified 12-bar structure (in both harmony and lyrics) and a melody centered on flatted third of the tonic (and flatted seventh of the subdominant), is a blues song transformed into a rock and roll song. [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s style of rock and roll was heavily influenced by the blues and its derivative boogie woogie. His style of music was not exactly rockabilly but it has been often called real rock and roll (this is a label he shares with several African American rock and roll performers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lclark.edu/~ria/the_bl~1.htm|title=The Blues Influence On Rock & Roll|accessdate=2008-08-17}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zip-country.com/Rock.htm|title=History of Rock and Roll|work=Zip-Country Homepage|accessdate=2008-09-02}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Many early rock and roll songs are based on blues: "[[That's All Right Mama]]," "[[Johnny B. Goode]]," "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]," "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On]]," "[[Shake, Rattle, and Roll]]," and "[[Long Tall Sally]]." The early African American rock musicians retained the sexual themes and innuendos of blues music: "Got a gal named Sue, knows just what to do" ("[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]," [[Little Richard]]) or "See the girl with the red dress on, She can do the Birdland all night long" ("[[What'd I Say (song)|What'd I Say]]," [[Ray Charles]]). The 12-bar blues structure can be found even in novelty pop songs, such as [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Obviously Five Believers]]" and [[Esther and Abi Ofarim]]'s "[[Cinderella Rockefella]]."

Early [[country music]] was infused with the blues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colum.edu/CBMR/Styles_and_Genres/Country_Music.php|title=Country music|publisher=Columbia College Chicago|date=2007–2008|accessdate=2008-09-02|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080602011023/http://www.colum.edu/CBMR/Styles_and_Genres/Country_Music.php|archivedate=2008-06-02}}</ref> [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Moon Mullican]], [[Bob Wills]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Hank Williams]] have all described themselves as blues singers and their music has a blues feel that is different to the country pop of [[Eddy Arnold]]. A lot of the 1970s-era "outlaw" country music by [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Waylon Jennings]] also borrowed from the blues. When [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] returned to country after the decline of 1950s style rock and roll, he sang his country with a blues feel and often included blues standards on his albums.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Tajmahalblues.jpg|thumb|right|175 px|The music of [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] for the 1972 movie ''[[Sounder]]'' marked a revival of interest in acoustic blues.]]
Like [[jazz]], [[rock and roll]], [[heavy metal music]], [[hip hop music]], [[reggae]], [[country music]], and [[pop music]], blues has been accused of being the "[[Satan|devil]]'s music" and of inciting violence and other poor behavior.<ref>SFGate</ref> In the early 20th century, the blues was considered disreputable, especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s.<ref name="trkeja"/> In the early twentieth century, [[W. C. Handy|W.C. Handy]] was the first to popularize blues-influenced music among non-black Americans.

During the blues revival of the 1960s and '70s, acoustic blues artist [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and legendary Texas bluesman [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] wrote and performed music that figured prominently in the popularly and critically acclaimed film ''[[Sounder (film)|Sounder]]'' (1972). The film earned Mahal a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture and a [[BAFTA]] nomination.<ref>"Sounder"[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069303/awards|The Internet Movie Database]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}. Retrieved February 11, 2007.</ref> Almost 30&nbsp;years later, Mahal wrote blues for, and performed a banjo composition, claw-hammer style, in the 2001 movie release ''[[Songcatcher]]'', which focused on the story of the preservation of the [[Appalachian music|roots music of Appalachia]].

Perhaps the most visible example of the blues style of music in the late 20th century came in 1980, when [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]] released the film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. The film drew many of the biggest living influencers of the [[Rhythm and blues]] genre together, such as [[Ray Charles]], [[James Brown]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and [[John Lee Hooker]]. The band formed also began a successful tour under the [[The Blues Brothers|Blues Brothers]] marquee. 1998 brought a sequel, ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' that, while not holding as great a critical and financial success, featured a much larger number of blues artists, such as [[B.B. King]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Charlie Musselwhite]], [[Blues Traveler]], [[Jimmie Vaughan]], [[Jeff Baxter]].

In 2003, [[Martin Scorsese]] made significant efforts to promote the blues to a larger audience. He asked several famous directors such as [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Wim Wenders]] to participate in a series of documentary films for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] called ''[[The Blues (film)|The Blues]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|title="The Blues" (2003) (mini)|id=0287198}}</ref> He also participated in the rendition of compilations of major blues artists in a series of high-quality CDs. Blues guitarist and vocalist [[Keb' Mo']] performed his blues rendition of "[[America, the Beautiful]]" in 2006 to close out the final season of the television series ''[[The West Wing]]''.
