He founded the important [[abbey]] on [[Iona]], which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of [[Derry]]. He was highly regarded by both the [[Gaels]] of [[Dál Riata]] and the [[Picts]], and is remembered today as a Christian [[saint]] and one of the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]].<ref name="Flood"/>

Columba reportedly studied under some of Ireland's most prominent church figures and founded several monasteries in the country. Around 563 he and his twelve companions sailed to Iona in Scotland, then part of the Irish kingdom of Dál Riata, where they founded a new abbey as a base for spreading Christianity among the [[Fortriu|northern Pictish kingdoms]]<ref>Early Christian Ireland
 By T. M. Charles-Edwards p303</ref><ref>Pictish Warrior AD 297-841
 By Paul Wagner p14 states the Northern Pictish nations were still pagan while the southern Pictish kingdoms were Christian</ref> who were pagan. He remained active in Irish politics, though he spent most of the remainder of his life in Scotland. Three surviving early medieval Latin [[hymn]]s may be attributed to him.

==Early life in Ireland==
Columba was born to Fedlimid and Eithne of the [[Cenel Conaill]] in [[Gartan]], near Lough Gartan, in modern [[County Donegal]], [[Ulster]] in the north of [[Ireland]]. On his father's side, he was great-great-grandson of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]], an [[High King of Ireland|Irish high king]] of the 5th century. He was [[Baptism|baptised]] in Temple-Douglas, in the County Donegal parish of [[Conwal and Leck|Conwal]] (mid-way between Gartan and [[Letterkenny]]), by his teacher and foster-uncle [[Saint Crunathan]].<ref name="Colton">[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/catholic-church-archdiocese-of-armagh-northern-i/acts-of-archbishop-colton-in-his-metropolitan-visitation-in-the-diocese-of-derry-hta/page-10-acts-of-archbishop-colton-in-his-metropolitan-visitation-in-the-diocese-of-derry-hta.shtml Acts of Archbishop Colton in his metropolitan visitation in the diocese of Derry, A.D.

When sufficiently advanced in letters he entered the monastic school of [[Moville]] under St. [[Finnian of Movilla|Finnian]] who had studied at St. [[Ninian]]'s "Magnum Monasterium" on the shores of Galloway. He was about twenty, and a deacon when, having completed his training at Moville, he travelled southwards into Leinster, where he became a pupil of an aged bard named Gemman. On leaving him, Columba entered the monastery of Clonard, governed at that time by [[Finnian of Clonard|Finnian]], noted for sanctity and learning. Here he imbibed the traditions of the Welsh Church, for Finnian had been trained in the schools of St. David. <ref name=edmonds>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04136a.htm Edmonds, Columba. "St. Columba." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 24 Jul. 2013]</ref>

In [[early Christian Ireland]] the [[druid]]ic tradition collapsed due to the spread of the new Christian faith. The study of [[Latin]] learning and [[Christian theology]] in [[Monastery|monasteries]] flourished. Columba became a pupil at the monastic school at [[Clonard Abbey]], situated on the [[River Boyne]] in modern [[County Meath]]. During the sixth century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish Christianity studied at the Clonard monastery. It is said that the average number of scholars under instruction at Clonard was 3,000.<ref name="Flood">{{CathEncy|first=W.H. |last=Gratton-Flood|title=The Twelve Apostles of Erin|id=01632a|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref> Twelve students who studied under [[Finnian of Clonard|St. Finnian]] became known as the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]]; Columba was one of them. He became a monk and eventually was [[Ordination|ordained]] a [[Presbyter|priest]]. 

Another preceptor of Columba was St. Mobhi, whose monastery at Glasnevin was frequented by such famous men as St. Canice, St. Comgall, and St. Ciaran. A pestilence which devastated Ireland in 544 caused the dispersion of Mobhi's disciples, and Columba returned to Ulster, the land of his kindred. He was a striking figure of great stature and powerful build, with a loud, melodious voice which could be heard from one hilltop to another.<ref name=crawley>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/COLUMBA.htm "Saint Columba, Abbot and Confessor", Crawley, John J., ''Lives of the Saints'', John J. Crawley & co., Inc.]</ref> The following years were marked by the foundation of several important monasteries, Derry, Durrow, Kells, and [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]].<ref name=Sidwell_70>{{Citation |last= Sidwell|first=Keith|title= Reading Medieval Latin|page=70|year= 1995|place=Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-44747-X}}</ref> While at Derry it is said that he planned a pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem, but did not proceed farther than Tours. Thence he brought a copy of those gospels that had lain on the bosom of St. Martin for the space of 100 years. This relic was deposited in Derry.<ref name=edmonds/>

Tradition asserts that, sometime around 560, he became involved in a quarrel with [[Finnian of Moville|Saint Finnian]] of [[Movilla Abbey]] over a [[psalter]]. Columba copied the manuscript at the [[scriptorium]] under Saint Finnian, intending to keep the copy. Saint Finnian disputed his right to keep the copy. The dispute eventually led to the pitched Battle of Cúl Dreimhne in 561, during which many men were killed. A second grievance that he led him to induce the clan Neill to rise and engage in battle against King Diarmait at Cooldrevny in 561 was the king's violation of the right of sanctuary belonging to Columba's person as a monk on the occasion of the murder of Prince Curnan, the saint's kinsman.<ref name=edmonds/> Prince Curnan of Connaught, who had fatally injured a rival in a hurling match and had taken refuge with Columba, was dragged from his protector's arms and slain by Diarmaid's men, in defiance of the rights of sanctuary.<ref name=crawley/>

A [[synod]] of [[clerics]] and scholars threatened to [[Excommunication|excommunicate]] him for these deaths, but St. [[Brendan of Birr]] spoke on his behalf with the result that he was allowed to go into exile instead. Columba's own conscience was uneasy, and on the advice of an aged hermit, Molaise, he resolved to expiate his offense by going into exile and win for Christ as many souls as had perished in the terrible battle of Cuil Dremne. He left Ireland, to return only once, many years later. Columba's copy of the [[psalter]] has been traditionally associated with the [[Cathach of St. Columba]].

==Scotland==
In 563, he travelled to [[Scotland]] with twelve companions, in a wicker coracle covered with leather, and according to legend he first landed on the [[Mull of Kintyre|Kintyre]] Peninsula, near [[Southend, Kintyre|Southend]]. However, being still in sight of his native land, he moved further north up the west coast of Scotland. The island of [[Iona]] was made over to him by his kinsman Conall, king of the British Dalriada, who perhaps had invited him to come to Scotland in the first place.<ref name=crawley/>  However, there is a sense in which he was not leaving his native people, as the [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Gaels]] had been colonizing the west coast of Scotland for the previous couple of centuries.<ref name=Fletcher_23>{{Citation |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=23–24|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}</ref>  Aside from the services he provided guiding the only centre of [[literacy]] in the region, his reputation as a holy man led to his role as a [[diplomat]] among the tribes;<ref>[http://www.stcolumbaretreathouse.com/saint_columba.htm "Who is St. Columba?"] St. Columba Retreat House. Retrieved 6 October 2008.</ref> there are also many stories of miracles which he performed during his work to [[religious conversion|convert]] the Picts, the most famous being his encounter with the [[Loch Ness Monster]] in 565 AD, where he banished a ferocious "water beast" to the depths of the [[River Ness]] after it had killed a Pict and then tried to attack Columba's disciple (see Vita Columbae Book 2 below). He visited the [[Paganism|pagan]] King [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]], King of [[Fortriu]], at his base in [[Inverness]], winning the Bridei's respect, although not his conversion.  He subsequently played a major role in the politics of the country.  He was also very energetic in his work as a missionary, and, in addition to founding several churches in the [[Hebrides]], he worked to turn his monastery at Iona into a school for missionaries.  He was a renowned [[man of letters]], having written several [[hymns]] and being credited with having [[Calligraphy|transcribe]]d 300 books.  One of the few, if not the only, times he left Scotland was towards the end of his life, when he returned to Ireland to found the [[Durrow Abbey|monastery]] at [[Durrow, County Offaly|Durrow]].

Columba died on Iona and was buried in AD 597 by his [[monk]]s in the [[abbey]] he created.   In AD 794, the Vikings descended on Iona. Columba's relics were finally removed in AD 849 and divided between Scotland and Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/columba/ |title=Scotland's History - Columba |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> The parts of the relics which went to Ireland are reputed to be buried in [[Downpatrick]], [[County Down]], with [[St. Patrick]] and [[St. Brigid]] or at Saul Church neighbouring Downpatrick.

==Legacy==

===Scotland===
Columba is credited as being a leading figure in the revitalization of [[monasticism]]. It is known that [[Clan MacCallum]] and [[Clan Malcolm]] are descended from the original followers of Columba, It is also said that [[Clan Robertson]] are heirs of Columba.  [[Clan MacKinnon]] may also have some claim to being spiritual descendants of St Columcille as after he founded his monastery on Isle [[Iona]], the MacKinnons were the [[abbot]]s of the Church for centuries.  This would also account for the fact that Clan MacKinnon is amongst the ancient clans of Scotland.<ref name="Eerdman's">{{Citation |editor=Dowley, Tim, et al.| title=Eerdman's Handbook to the History of Christianity |year=1977|publisher= [[Eerdmans Publishing]] |location= Grand Rapids, Michigan|language= |isbn= 0-8028-3450-7}}</ref>

The [[cathedral]] of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles|Diocese of Argyll and the Isles]] is placed under the patronage of St. Columba, as are numerous [[Catholic school]]s and parishes throughout the nation. The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] and [[Church of Scotland]] also have parishes dedicated to him. The village of [[Kilmacolm]] in [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]] is also derived from Columba's name.

===Ireland===
Columba is the patron-saint of the city of [[Derry]], where he founded a monastic settlement in c.AD 540. The name of the city in [[Irish Gaelic|Irish]] is ''Doire Colmcille'' and is derived from the native oak trees in the area and the city's association with Columba. The Catholic Church of Saint Columba's Long Tower stands at the spot of this original settlement. The [[Church of Ireland]] Cathedral in Derry is dedicated to St Columba.
[http://www.stcolmcilles.org/ St. Colmcilles Primary School] and [http://www.stcolmcilles.ie/ St. Colmcilles Community School] are two schools in [[Knocklyon]], [[Dublin]], named after St. Colmcille, with the former having an annual day dedicated to the saint on 9 June.
[[Aer Lingus]], Ireland's national [[flag carrier]] has named one of its [[Airbus A330]] aircraft in commemoration of the saint (reg: EI-DUO).

===Other===
As of 2011, [[Canadians]] who are of [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]] ancestry are the third largest [[ethnic group]] in the country and thus Columba's name is to be found attached to Catholic, [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican]] and [[Presbyterian]] parishes. This is particularly the case in [[eastern Canada]] apart from [[Quebec]] which is [[French language|French]]-speaking.

Throughout the [[U.S.A.]] there are numerous parishes within the [[Latin Rite|Catholic]] and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] denominations dedicated to Columba. Within the [[Protestant]] tradition the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian]] Church (which has its roots in Scottish Presbyterianism) also has parishes named in honour of Columba. There is even an [[Orthodox Church]] monastery dedicated to the saint in the [[Massachusetts]] town of [[Southbridge, Massachusetts|Southbridge]]. St. Columba is the Patron Saint of the Roman Catholic [[Diocese of Youngstown]], OH. The Cathedral there is named for him.

[http://stcolumbamonastery.org/] [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]], a small [[Catholic]] [[liberal arts]] [[college]] in [[New Rochelle, NY]], is named after the island on which Columba established his first monastery in Scotland, as is [[Iona College (Windsor)|Iona College]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]].

There are at least four [[pipe band]]s named for him; one each from [[Tullamore]], [[Ireland]][http://www.facebook.com/StColmcillesPipeBand], from [[Derry, Northern Ireland]][http://www.colmcillepipeband.com/], from [[Kearny, New Jersey]][http://stcolumcille.com/], and from [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]][http://www.capecodpipesanddrums.com].

==''Vita Columbae''==
[[File:Saint Columba.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Columba. [[Stained glass]] window in [[Iona Abbey]]]]
The main source of information about Saint Columba's life is the Vita Columbae (i.e. "Life of Columba"), a hagiography written in the style of “saint’s lives” narratives that had become widespread throughout medieval Europe. Compiled and drafted by scribes and clergymen, these accounts were written in Latin and served as written collections of the deeds and miracles attributed to the saint, both during his or her life or after death. The canonization of a saint, especially one who had lived on the fringes of the medieval Christian world like Saint Columba, required a well-written hagiography to be submitted to Rome, but popular belief and local cults of sainthood often led to the veneration of these men and women without official approval from the Catholic Church. 

Writing a century after the death of Saint Columba, the author Adomnán (also known as Eunan), served as the ninth Abbot of Iona until his death in 704 A.D.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01135c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Adamnan (Eunan)]. Newadvent.org (1907-03-01). Retrieved on 2013-07-23.</ref>

James Earle Frasier asserts that Adomnán drew extensively from an existing body of accounts regarding the life of Saint Columba, including a Latin collection entitled “De uirtutibus sancti Columbae”, composed c. 640 A.D. This earlier work is attributed to Cummene Find, who became the abbot of Iona and served as the leader of the monastic island community from 656 until his death in 668 A.D. or 669 A.D.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=JaliXwNMpFsC&pg=PA98&dq=vita+columbae+manuscripts&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r06FUYHeMNCUqwH3u4CICA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=vita%20columbae%20manuscripts&f=false From Caledonia to Pictland: Scotland to 795 - James E. Fraser - Google Books]. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-23.</ref>

While the Vita Columbae often conflicts with contemporaneous accounts of various battles, figures, and dates, it remains the most important surviving work from early medieval Scotland and provides a wealth of knowledge regarding the Picts and other ethnic and political groups from this time period. The Vita also offers a valuable insight into the monastic practices of Iona and the daily life of the early medieval Gaelic monks.

The surviving manuscripts include:

Generalia 1 (A), Stadtbibliothek Schaffhausen, Switzerland; vellum, probably written before 713
British Library MS Add. 35110 (B1), folios 96v-143r, probably written before 1165.

British Library MS Cottonian Tiberius D III (B2), folios 192r-217r, written end of 12th to early 13th century. Due to fire damage in 1731, there are missing illegible portions on every page, and six folios [Book I, ch. 2 (diebus) to 22 (genibus) and 36 (viro) to 49 (omnia quae)] are missing completely.

British Library MS Royal 8 D IX (B3), folios 1r-70r, written in the fifteenth or early sixteenth century. The first 8 folios, [to I, 3 (haec puro pectore)] are missing.<ref>[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T201040/ Life of St. Columba]. Ucc.ie. Retrieved on 2013-07-23.</ref>

Instead of relying on chronological order, Adomnán categorizes the events recorded in the Vita Columbae into three different books: Columba’s Prophecies, Columba’s Miracles, and Columba’s Apparitions.[13] 
.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T201040/index.html |title=Life of St. Columba |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>

===Book one (Of his Prophetic Revelations)===

In the first book, the author Adomnán lists Saint Columba’s prophetic revelations, which come as a result of the saint’s ability to view the present and the future simultaneously. Most of the short chapters begin with Saint Columba informing his fellow monks that a person will soon arrive on the island or an event will immanently occur.

In one notable instance, Columba appears in a dream to King Oswald of Northumbria, and announces the king’s incoming victory against the King Catlon (Cadwallon of Wales) in the Battle of Heavenfield. The people of Britain promise to convert to Christianity and receive baptism after the conclusion of the war. This victory signals the re-Christianization of pagan England, and establishes King Oswald as ruler of the entirety of Britain. 

Columba’s other prophecies can be considered vindictive at times, as when he sends a man named Batain off to perform his penance, but then Columba turns to his friends and says Batain will instead return to Scotia and be killed by his enemies. 
Several of Saint Columba’s prophecies reflect the scribal culture in which he was immersed, such his miraculous knowledge of the missing letter “I” from Baithene’s psalter [15] or when he prophecies that an eager man will knock over his inkhorn and spill its contents.<ref>Book one, Chapter 17</ref>

=== Book two (Of his Miraculous Powers) ===

In the second book, Columba performs various miracles such as healing people with diseases, expelling malignant spirits, subduing wild beasts, calming storms, and even returning the dead to life.

He also performs agricultural miracles that would hold a special significance to the common people of Ireland and the British Isles, such as when he casts a demon out of a pail and restores the spilt milk to its container.

The Vita contains a story that has been interpreted as the first reference to the Loch Ness Monster. According to Adomnán, Columba came across a group of Picts burying a man who had been killed by the monster. Columba saves a swimmer from the monster with the sign of the Cross and the imprecation, "Thou shalt go no further, nor touch the man; go back with all speed." The beast flees, terrified, to the amazement of the assembled Picts who glorified Columba's God. Whether or not this incident is true, Adomnan's text specifically states that the monster was swimming in the River Ness - the river flowing from the loch - rather than in Loch Ness itself.[18].<ref>Book two, Chapter 28</ref>

=== Book three (The Apparitions of Angels) ===

In book three, Adomnán describes different apparitions of the Saint, both that Columba receives and those that are seen by others regarding him. He mentions that, “For indeed after the lapse of many years, when St. Columba was excommunicated by a certain synod for some pardonable and very trifling reasons, and indeed unjustly,” (P.79- 80)

In one of the accounts, Saint Columba, in this period of excommunication, goes to a meeting held against him in Teilte. Saint Brendan, despite of all the negative reactions among the seniors toward Columba, kisses him reverently and assures that Columba is the man of God and that he sees Holy Angels accompanying Columba on his journey through the plain.[19]
.<ref>Book three, Chapter 3</ref>

In the last Chapter, Columba foresees his own death when speaking to his attendant: <blockquote>This day in the Holy Scriptures is called the Sabbath, which means rest. And this day is indeed a Sabbath to me, for it is the last day of my present laborious life, and on it I rest after the fatigues of my labours; and this night at midnight, which commenceth the solemn Lord's Day, I shall, according to the sayings of Scripture, go the way of our fathers. For already my Lord Jesus Christ deigneth to invite me; and to Him, I say, in the middle of this night shall I depart, at His invitation. For so it hath been revealed to me by the Lord himself. </blockquote>

And when the bell strikes midnight, Columba goes to the church and kneels beside the altar. His attendant witnesses heavenly light in the direction of Columba, and Holy angels joins the saint in his passage to the Lord: <blockquote>And having given them his holy benediction in this way, he immediately breathed his last. After his soul had left the tabernacle of the body, his face still continued ruddy, and brightened in a wonderful way by his vision of the angels, and that to such a degree that he had the appearance, not so much of one dead, as of one alive and sleeping.<ref>Book three, Chapter 23</ref> </blockquote>

==Other early sources of Columba's life==
Both the ''Vita Columbae'' and the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] (672/673-735) record Columba's visit to [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]]. Whereas Adomnán just tells us that Columba visited Bridei, Bede relates a later, perhaps Pictish tradition, whereby the saint actually converts the Pictish king. Another early source is a poem in praise of Columba, most probably commissioned by Columba's kinsman, the King of the [[Uí Néill]] clan. It was almost certainly written within three or four years of Columba's death and is the earliest vernacular poem in European history. It consists of 25 [[stanza]]s of four verses of seven syllables each.

Through the reputation of its venerable founder and its position as a major European centre of learning, Columba's Iona became a place of [[pilgrimage]]. A network of Celtic [[high cross]]es marking processional routes developed around his shrine at Iona.

Columba is historically revered as a warrior saint, and was often invoked for victory in battle.
His relics were finally removed in 849 and divided between [[Alba]] and Ireland. Relics of Columba were carried before Scottish armies in the reliquary made at Iona in the mid-8th century, called the Brecbennoch.
Legend has it that the Brecbennoch was carried to the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] (24 June 1314) by the vastly outnumbered Scots army and the intercession of Columba helped them to victory. It is widely thought that the [[Monymusk Reliquary]] is the object in question.

In the [[Antiphoner]] of [[Inchcolm Abbey]], the "Iona of the East" (situated on an island in the [[Firth of Forth]]), a 13th-century prayer begins ''O Columba spes Scotorum...'' "O Columba, hope of the Scots".
