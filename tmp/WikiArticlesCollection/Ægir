'''Ægir''' ([[Old Norse]] "sea"<ref name=LINDOW47>Lindow (2001:47).</ref>) is a [[jötunn|sea giant]], god of the [[ocean]] and king of the sea creatures in [[Norse mythology]]. He is also known for hosting elaborate parties for the [[Æsir|gods]].

Ægir's servants are [[Fimafeng]] (killed by [[Loki]]) and [[Eldir]].

== Description ==
While many versions of myths portray Ægir as a giant, it is curious that many do not. In some texts, he is referred to as something older than the giants, and his origins are not really explained.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Attestations ==
Both ''[[Fundinn Noregr]]'' and [[Snorri Sturluson]] in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' state that Ægir is the same as the sea-giant '''Hlér''', who lives on the isle of [[Hlesey|Hlésey]], and this is borne out by kennings.<ref name=SIMEK151>Simek (1993:151).</ref><ref name=DEVRIES1251>de Vries (1956:251).</ref> Snorri uses his visiting the Æsir as the frame of that section of the [[Prose Edda]].

In ''[[Lokasenna]]'', Ægir hosts a party for the gods where he provides the ale brewed in an enormous pot or cauldron provided by [[Thor]] and [[Týr]]. The story of their obtaining the pot from the giant [[Hymir]] is told in ''[[Hymiskviða]]''.

The prose introduction to ''Lokasenna'' and Snorri's list of kennings state that Ægir is also known as [[Gymir]], who is [[Gerðr]]'s father, but this is evidently an erroneous interpretation of [[kenning]]s in which different giant-names are used interchangeably.<ref name=SIMEK126>Simek (1993:126).</ref>

== Family ==

According to ''Fundinn Noregr'', Ægir is a son of the giant [[Fornjót]]r and brother of [[Logi]] ("fire") and [[Kári]] ("wind").<ref name=LINDOW48>Lindow (2001:48).</ref>

Ægir's wife is [[Rán]] the sea goddess. She is by Ægir mother of [[Daughters of Ægir|nine billow maidens]], whose names are:
*Bára (or Dröfn, ''wave'')
*Blóðughadda (''the one with blood-red hair – the color of the waves after a naval battle'')
*Bylgja (''to billow'', or ''big wave'')
*Dúfa (''the pitching wave'')
*Hefring (''the surging wave'')
*Himinglæva (''the wave that reflects the light of the sky'')
*Hrönn (''the grasping wave'')
*Kólga (''the chilling wave'')
*Unnr (or Uðr, ''wave'')
