In his analysis of ''The Very Best of Amr Diab'' album, Victor W. Valdivia of [[Allmusic]] said: "His music melded traditional Arabic sounds and textures with Western rhythms and instruments. The mesh was dubbed Mediterranean music, and The Very Best of Amr Diab displays Diab's superb skill in creating it."<ref>{{cite web | last= Valdivia | first= Victor W. | title= The Very Best of Amr Diab | url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r565771|pure_url=yes}} | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=4 June 2009 }}</ref>

In 1997, he won three awards at the Annual Arabic Festival: one for Best Video, for Best Song, and for Best Artist of the Year. The following year Diab received a Triple Platinum Award for the sales of ''[[Nour El Ain]]'' and received a World Music Award in Monaco.

== Musical career ==
In 1983, Diab released his first studio album, ''Ya Tareeq''. Diab released three more albums between 1984 and 1987. 1988's "Mayaal" garnered huge success all around the Middle East. It was produced, arranged and remixed by [[German people|German]] musicians, Frank Von Dem Bottlenberg, Ziyad Abou Chair and Jörg Evers, with several releases. More success followed in the following years including the albums ''Shawakkna'', ''Matkhafesh'', and ''We Yloumouni''.

Amr Diab quickly developed fame for his new style of "Pan-Mediterranean" Arabic music, fusing touches of [[flamenco]] and [[raï]] with western pop with traditional Arabic rhythms. B1992, he became the first Arabic artist to start making high-tech music videos.<ref name=tinge/>

"Habibi" from Diab's 1996 album ''[[Nour El Ain]]'' became a hit worldwide and was remixed by many of the world's top DJs at the time.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} A special CD named ''Habibi: The Remix Album'' was released later with all of these remixes. Since then, Diab has remained at the top of the Arabic music scene, expanding reach to all parts of the Mediterranean with his 1999 release, ''Amarain'', that featured duets with The Legendary King of Rai [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]] in a song called "Qalbi" and Greece's [[Angela Dimitriou]] in "Ana Bahibak Aktar" and "Eleos". "Tamally Maak" from Diab's 2000 album became a huge success. ''Leily Nahari'', Diab's first album with [[Rotana Records]], was released in 2004. His album ''El Leila De'' was released in the summer of 2007 and topped the Arabic music charts for 22 weeks. Diab received a World Music Award for Best Selling Middle Eastern Artist for the album. In 2008, Diab renewed his contract with Rotana for five more years.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 2009, Diab released a new album ''[[Wayah]]''.

== Influences and contributions ==
Diab revolutionized Egyptian show business in several respects,{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} and some of his biographers have referred to him as rebellious, because he challenged everything in Middle Eastern show business, from hairstyle and appearance to music style, presentation, and the financial scale of his projects.

Diab’s blending of Western rhythms with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern music styles created a new music style, referred to as Mediterranean music. His song “Tamalli Ma’ak”/“Always With You,” where he introduced [[classical guitar]], is a good example of the genre.

== Albums ==
{{Main|Amr Diab Discography}}

=== ''Nour El Ain'' ===

In 1996, ''[[Nour El Ain]]'' (Light of The Eye – Sight) was released, becoming a tremendous success not only in the Middle East but throughout the entire world. The song was composed by [[Nasser el-Mizdawi]], lyrics were written by Ahmed Sheta and it was arranged by Hameed Elshaery. The title track, and its English version "Habibi", was an international phenomenon, becoming a massive crossover hit in countries such as [[Pakistan]], [[India]] (performed by Nachiketa in Bengali keeping the tune and composition and replacing the lyrics with his own), [[Afghanistan]], [[Sri Lanka]] (performed by Sangeeth Wickremasinghe) and [[Malaysia]] ([[Malay language|Malay]] version sung by Datuk Sharifah Aini). The song was remade with [[Malayalam]] lyrics the movie ''[[Chandralekha (1997 film)|Chandralekha]]''. In a style reminiscent of the Aldo (musician) Franco-Arabic style, the song was remixed by several top European arrangers and has become a big pull on the dance floors of Europe. The video clip, also [[Film producer|produced]] by Alam El Phan for the song "Nour El Ain", was one of the most lavish and expensive productions in the field of Egyptian song and set a new standard for his contemporaries to aspire to. This album sold 2.3 million copies.

In 1997, Amr Diab won three awards at the Annual Arabic Festival (for Best Video, Best Song and Artist of the Year). In the following year, he received a Triple Platinum Award for the sales of ''Nour El Ain'' and received a [[World Music Awards|World Music Award]] in Monaco on 6 May 1998, under the patronage of H.S.H. Albert II, Prince of Monaco. This award was the first of its kind for an Egyptian artist, emphasizing that his appeal is not confined to the Middle East, unlike the majority of his contemporaries.

=== ''Awedoni'' ===

His follow-up studio album titled ''[[Awedony]]'' (They made me used to...) was released in July 1998 and, as with ''Nour El Ain'', it was [[Record producer|produced]] with Hamid El Shaery and recorded in [[Cairo]], Egypt. The first video from the album, the title track "Awedooni", was shot by the Nile in Egypt and directed by Tareq Al Aryan. Like its predecessor, this album was a huge success for Amr and reinforced his popularity in the Arab world and abroad.

=== ''Amarain'' ===

Diab released his July 1999 new studio album ''Amarain'' (two moons), which is hailed as the best work of his career.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Amr is working on eagerly anticipated duets with the France-based international Rai superstar, [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]] of "[[Didi (single)|Didi]]" fame, and with the Greek singer, [[Angela Dimitrou]], whose crossover smash "Marguerites" was a huge hit across the Middle East in 1998. The title track "Amarain" was the first video to be broadcast.

=== ''Tamally Ma'ak'' ===
{{Main|Tamally Maak|l1=Tamally Ma'ak}}

In July 2000, Diab revolutionized Arab music when he issued ''[[Tamally Maak|Tamally Ma'ak]]'' (I'm Always With You). The song was composed by Sherif Tag, a modern Egyptian composer. He introduced the Spanish guitar in "Tamally Ma'ak" and in other songs. The clip of this song was made in the [[Czech Republic]] with much success. The album contained songs like "El Allem Alla" (Only God Knows), "Ba'terf" (I Confess) which were composed by [[Amr Mostafa]], the best Middle Eastern composer, "Sa'ban Alaea" (It Makes Me Feel Sorry) and "We Heya Amla Eih" (And How Is She?). The song "Tamally Ma'ak" was copied in the hit [[Bollywood]] song "Kaho Na Kaho" from the film ''[[Murder (film)|Murder]]''
and also "I'm Calling U" by the group [[Outlandish]].

=== ''Aktar Wahed'' ===

''Aktar Wahed'' was released on 1 August 2001. The album's name ''[[Aktar Wahed]]'' is short for one of the songs, "Aktar Wahed Beyhebbak" (One loves you the most). It contains 10 tracks and received the [[World Music Award]] for the best-selling album in the [[Middle East]] for 2001.

=== ''Allem Albi'' ===

In February 2003, Diab released ''[[Allem Alby]]'' (Teach My Heart). The album's release date was arranged to be with the debut broadcast of Alam El Phan's (''Allem Alby'''s production company, owned by Mohsen Gaber) music channel Mazzika.

The album was a great success, with the release of the video "Ana Ayesh" (I'm Alive) which was directed by Stuart Gosling. The video was intensely broadcast on Mazzika. The album contains other songs, like the [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]]-influenced hit, "Allem Albi". Others that tend to be more distinctively Arabic-sounding are songs like "Kolohom" (All of Them), "Law Ash'any" (If You Adore Me), and "Alli El Wadaa'" (Goodbye To Me).

=== ''Leily Nahary'' ===

In late summer 2004, Diab's first album with [[Rotana Records|Rotana]] was released: ''[[Leily Nahary]]'' (My Nights, My Days). The album's cover was from the promotional photo shoot of [[Pepsi]]. The video "Leily Nahari" directed by Cameron Casey provided aid to give Diab his space in the record-exclusive music channels. It was criticized because of its similarity to his previously unreleased video for "El Alem Allah" from the album ''Tamally Ma'ak''.

=== ''Kammel Kalamak'' ===

Diab's album ''[[Kammel Kalamak]]'', released on 14 December 2005, was the follow-up to ''Leily Nahary''. The love ballad "We Malo" was released as the single of the album, ''Kammel Kalamak''. The music video was shot in [[London]] and was released on a late notice after the release of the album. Rumors surfaced in late 2005 and early 2006 stated that Amr is considering terminating his contract with [[Rotana Records|Rotana]] due to the poor promotion of ''[[Kammel Kalamak]]''.

=== ''El Lilady'' ===

The album ''[[El Lilady]]'' (or ''El Leila De'') was originally set to be released after [[Ramadan]] 2006. However, it was pushed back several times due to Diab's repeated changes in the [[musical producer]]s he was dealing with. Diab attributes the changes to the producer's lack of new and strong styles. In early 2006, music [[arranger]] Fahd was supposed to work on this album; however, later that year [[Tarek Madkour]] joined Amr Diab, and they started together to work on it. On 25 March 2007, Madkour's official website announced that Amr Diab and Madkour had decided jointly to skip the collaboration on the album due to the lack of time and conflicting working schedules. Fahd and new producer Hasan Al Shafei are elected to produce the music in the album, which was supposed to hit the markets in July 2007. The title of the album was changed from ''Khaleek Ma'aya'' to ''El Leila De''. After the release Amr, shot a new Pepsi advertisement in Europe. On 21 June 2007, two of the biggest sites (AmrDiabWorld.com and AmrDiab.info) for Amr Diab announced that ''El Lilady'' would hit the market on 7 July 2007. The album would contain 10 tracks; Al Shafei and Fahd shared the production: Al Shaei with seven songs and Fahd with three. Before releasing his album, Diab traveled to Portugal to shoot the new Pepsi ad, choosing "Inta El Ghaly" song from ''El Leila De'' as the ad. Amr then traveled to the USA to film the music video for his upcoming album.

The album master copy was given to Rotana, Amr Diab's CD production company, on the last week of June to meet the 7 July 2007 release date he had planned. Rotana, however, delayed the release of the new CD for a couple of days for unknown reasons. The album had been leaked. The album was officially released on 11 July 2007. The album has already become a huge hit in Egypt and all over the Middle East. The video clip has been slated for a 27 July release. The song that Diab chose to film was "N'eoul Eih", which is in the new style of [[House Music]] mixed with oriental Arabic music. The video clip was filmed in [[Santa Monica]] and [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], and also near [[Hollywood]].

On 30 October 2007, the management of the World Music Awards announced that Amr Diab was to receive an award for best selling artist in the Middle East for this album. Amr Diab received the award in the festival that was held in Monaco, Monte Carlo, on 4 November 2007.

=== ''Wayah'' (2009) ===

The world music award of for the best-selling album in the [[Middle East]] 2009, ''[[Wayah]]'' (With Her) was released for sale on the internet on 27 June; however, the album was leaked online and was downloaded illegally amid complaints of slow download speed on the official site. Diab's fans initiated a massive boycott of the sites with the illegal copies.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |coauthors= |title= Amr Diab's album sweeping cassette market |url= http://www.musicananet.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=831:2009-06-30-21-53-47&catid=55:2009-02-18-21-10-52&Itemid=93 |date= 30 June 2009 |publisher= Musicananet |accessdate=2 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} {{ar icon}}</ref>

Diab has collaborated with a variety of music video directors in the Middle East, including Tarek El-Erian and [[Sherif Sabri]].

The most anticipated video clip of 2007, "N'eoul Eih", was released on 14 August that year on Rotana TV. It was broadcast minutes later on [[Egyptian television]] on ''El Beit Betak''.

Diab also filmed "Ba2dem Alby" which was released on [[Valentine's Day]].

=== ''El Helm/The Dream'' ===

''The Dream'' or ''El Helm'' is a biographical TV production produced by Amr Afefy that gives viewers the story of Amr Diab's life. The show consists of 12 episodes and began airing on 24 December 2008.

The show, which aired on Rotana TV, saw great success and was preceded by one of the biggest advertising campaigns in the history of Middle Eastern music.

== Film career ==

Diab's fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, ''El Afareet'', which was released in 1989. It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film ''Ice Cream in Gleam'' (''Ays Krim fi Glym''), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's new program "Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films" at James Bridges Theater, UCLA,  6, 8 and 10 April. David Chute of the ''Los Angeles Weekly'' termed it "observant" and "a big leap".<ref>{{cite news |first= David |last= Chute |coauthors= Irene G. Behnan |title= All Singing!
