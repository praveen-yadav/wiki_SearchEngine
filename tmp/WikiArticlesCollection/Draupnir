In [[Norse mythology]], '''Draupnir''' ([[Old Norse]] "the dripper"<ref name=ORCHARD34>Orchard (1997:34).</ref>) is a gold ring possessed by the god [[Odin]] with the ability to multiply itself: Every ninth night eight new rings 'drip' from Draupnir, each one of the same size and weight as the original.

Draupnir was forged by the [[Norse dwarves|dwarven]] brothers [[Brokkr]] and [[Eitri]] (or [[Sindri (mythology)|Sindri]]). Brokkr and Eitri made this ring as one of a set of three gifts which included [[Mjöllnir]] and [[Gullinbursti]]. They made these gifts in accordance with a wager [[Loki]] made saying that Brokk and Eitri could not make better gifts than the three made by the [[Sons of Ivaldi]]. In the end [[Mjöllnir]], [[Thor]]'s hammer, won the contest for Brokkr and Eitri. Loki used a [[loophole]] to get out of the wager for his head (the wager was for Loki's head only, but he argued that, to remove his head, they would have to injure his neck, which was not in the bargain) and Brokkr punished him by sealing his lips shut with wire.

The ring was placed by Odin on the funeral pyre of his son [[Baldr]]:
<blockquote>
:Odin laid upon the pyre the gold ring called Draupnir; this quality attended it: that every ninth night there fell from it eight gold rings of equal weight. (from the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'').
</blockquote>

The ring was subsequently retrieved by [[Hermóðr]]. It was offered as a gift by [[Freyr]]'s servant [[Skírnir]] in the wooing of [[Gerðr]], which is described in the poem ''[[Skírnismál]]''.

==Draupnir in popular culture==

''DRAUPNIR'' was revealed as the password to a website that [[Neal Caffrey]] and [[Mozzie (White Collar)#Mozzie|Mozzie]] used to view their stolen Nazi U-boat treasure in "Taking Account", the seventh episode of the third season of ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]''.

Draupnir is represented as a card in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh Trading Card Game]]. It has an effect that mimics the multiplication ability of the mythological version. If it destroyed by another cards effect, you may add another "Nordic Relic" card to your hand. The art represents it as an arm brace, with another brace seemingly growing from it, once again mimicking the story.
