The '''''Benjamin Franklin''-class''' [[submarine]] was an evolutionary development from the {{sclass-|James Madison|submarine|4}} of fleet [[ballistic missile submarine]].  Having quieter machinery and other improvements, they are considered a separate class. A subset of this class is the re-engineered 640 class starting with {{USS|George C. Marshall| SSBN-654}}.  The ''Benjamin Franklin'' class, together with the {{sclass-|George Washington|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Ethan Allen|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Lafayette|submarine|5}}, and {{sclass-|James Madison|submarine|5}} classes, comprise the "[[41 for Freedom]]."

The ''Benjamin Franklin''-class submarines were built with the [[Polaris missile|Polaris A-3]] [[ballistic missile]], and later converted to carry the [[Poseidon missile|Poseidon C-3]].  During the late 1970s and early 1980s, selected units were further modified to carry [[Trident missile|Trident-I (C-4)]] ballistic missiles.

Two submarines of this class were converted for delivery of [[special warfare]] units ashore. In the early 1990s, to make room for the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|0}} ballistic missile submarines within the limits set by the [[SALT II]] strategic arms limitation treaty, the ballistic missile tubes of {{USS|Kamehameha|SSBN-642}} and {{USS|James K. Polk|SSBN-645}} were disabled. Those boats were redesignated [[special operations]] [[attack submarine]]s and given attack submarine (SSN) [[hull classification symbol|hull numbers]].

USS ''Kamehameha'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 2 April 2002, the last ship of the ''Benjamin Franklin'' class to be decommissioned.
