Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the [[Diffuse sky radiation|blue portion]] of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], followed by the red portion. However, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum, hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues.<ref>Chlorophyll molecules are specifically arranged in and around photosystems that are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.

==Chlorophyll and photosynthesis==
Chlorophyll is vital for [[photosynthesis]], which allows plants to absorb energy from light.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio104/photosyn.htm | title =Photosynthesis | author =J.

The function of the vast majority of chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light and transfer that light energy by [[resonance energy transfer]] to a specific chlorophyll pair in the [[reaction center]] of the photosystems.

The two currently accepted photosystem units are [[Photosystem II]] and [[Photosystem I]], which have their own distinct reaction center chlorophylls, named P680 and P700, respectively.<ref>Green, 1984</ref> These pigments are named after the wavelength (in [[nanometer]]s) of their red-peak absorption maximum. The identity, function and spectral properties of the types of chlorophyll in each photosystem are distinct and determined by each other and the protein structure surrounding them.

The function of the reaction center chlorophyll is to use the energy absorbed by and transferred to it from the other chlorophyll pigments in the photosystems to undergo a charge separation, a specific [[redox]] reaction in which the chlorophyll donates an [[electron]] into a series of molecular intermediates called an [[electron transport chain]]. The charged reaction center chlorophyll (P680<sup>+</sup>) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron. In Photosystem II, the electron that reduces P680<sup>+</sup> ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into O<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup> through several intermediates. This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms such as plants produce O<sub>2</sub> gas, and is the source for practically all the O<sub>2</sub> in Earth's atmosphere. Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II; thus the P700<sup>+</sup> of Photosystem I is usually reduced, via many intermediates in the thylakoid membrane, by electrons ultimately from Photosystem II. Electron transfer reactions in the thylakoid membranes are complex, however, and the source of electrons used to reduce P700<sup>+</sup> can vary.

The electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorophyll pigments is used to shuttle H<sup>+</sup> ions across the thylakoid membrane, setting up a [[chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] potential used mainly to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] chemical energy; and those electrons ultimately reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to [[NADPH]], a universal [[redox|reductant]] used to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> into sugars as well as for other biosynthetic reductions.

Reaction center chlorophyll–protein complexes are capable of directly absorbing light and performing charge separation events without other chlorophyll pigments, but the absorption cross section (the likelihood of absorbing a photon under a given light intensity) is small. Thus, the remaining chlorophylls in the photosystem and antenna pigment protein complexes associated with the photosystems all cooperatively absorb and funnel light energy to the reaction center. Besides chlorophyll ''a'', there are other pigments, called [[accessory pigment]]s, which occur in these pigment–protein antenna complexes.

A green sea slug, ''[[Elysia chlorotica]]'', has been found to use the chlorophyll it has eaten to perform photosynthesis for itself. This process is known as [[kleptoplasty]], and no other animal has been found to have this ability.

===Why green and not black?===
[[File:Black Pearl Plant.jpg|thumb|right|Black plants (such as this [[Black pearl pepper]]) can absorb more radiation, and yet most plants are green]]
It still is unclear exactly why plants have mostly evolved to be green. Green plants reflect mostly green and near-green light to viewers rather than absorbing it. Other parts of the system of [[photosynthesis]] still allow green plants to use the green light spectrum (e.g., through a light-trapping [[leaf]] structure, [[carotenoids]], etc.). Green plants do not use a large part of the visible spectrum as efficiently as possible. A black plant can absorb more radiation, and this could be very useful, if extra heat produced is effectively disposed of (e.g., some plants must close their openings, called [[stoma]]ta, on hot days to avoid losing too much water, which leaves only conduction, convection, and radiative heat-loss as solutions).<ref>{{cite book|last=Taiz, Zeiger|title=Plant Physiology|year=2002|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=0-87893-823-0|page=181}}</ref> The question becomes why the only light-absorbing molecule used for power in plants is green and not simply black. 

The biologist John Berman has offered the opinion that evolution is [[argument from poor design|not an engineering process]], and so it is often subject to various limitations that an [[engineer]] or other designer is not. Even '''''if''''' black leaves were better, evolution's limitations can prevent species from climbing to the absolute highest peak on the [[fitness landscape]]. Berman wrote that achieving pigments that work better than chlorophyll could be very difficult. In fact, all higher plants ([[embryophyte]]s) are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor that is a sort of [[green algae|green alga]] – with the idea being that chlorophyll has evolved only once.<ref name=JohnBerman>[http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/answers/viewtopic.php?id=3837 askabiologist.org/uk, Jonathan Max Berman, "Why did plants evolve green, not black?"]. Askabiologist.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-04-15.</ref>

Shil DasSarma, a microbial geneticist at the [[University of Maryland]], has pointed out that species of [[archaea]] do use another light-absorbing molecule, [[retinal]], to extract power from the green spectrum. He described the view of some scientists that such green-light-absorbing archae once dominated the earth environment. This could have left open a "niche" for green organisms that would absorb the other wavelengths of sunlight. This is just a possibility, and Berman wrote that scientists are still not convinced of any one explanation.<ref>[http://www.livescience.com/1398-early-earth-purple-study-suggests.html Early Earth Was Purple, Study Suggests]. Livescience.com (2007-04-10). Retrieved on 2012-04-15.</ref>

Astronomer and mathematician [[Fred Hoyle]] conjectured that chlorophyll was likely to be an interstellar molecule, pointing out the similarities of its light absorbing properties to interstellar dust.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoyle, Fred|title=Intelligent Universe|year=1988|publisher=Book Sales|isbn=978-0030700835|page=126}}</ref>

==Chemical structure==
[[Image:Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Space-filling model of the chlorophyll a molecule]]
Chlorophyll is a [[chlorin]] pigment, which is structurally similar to and produced through the same metabolic pathway as other [[porphyrin]] pigments such as [[heme]]. At the center of the chlorin ring is a [[magnesium]] [[ion]]. At the time of its discovery in the early 1900s, this was the first time that this element had been detected in living tissue.<ref name="motilva">{{Cite book

The chlorin ring can have several different side chains, usually including a long [[phytol]] chain. There are a few different forms that occur naturally, but the most widely distributed form in terrestrial plants is chlorophyll ''a''. After initial work done by German chemist [[Richard Willstätter]] spanning from 1905 to 1915, the general structure of chlorophyll ''a'' was elucidated by [[Hans Fischer]] in 1940.

When leaves degreen in the process of [[plant senescence]], chlorophyll is converted to a group of colourless [[tetrapyrrole]]s known as '''nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites''' (NCC's) with the general structure:

:[[Image:Nonfluorescentchlorophilcatabolites.svg|Nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites]]

These compounds have also been identified in several ripening fruits.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Müller|first1=Thomas|last2=Ulrich|first2=Markus|last3=Ongania|first3=Karl-Hans|last4=Kräutler|first4=Bernhard|year=2007|title=Colorless Tetrapyrrolic Chlorophyll Catabolites Found in Ripening Fruit Are Effective Antioxidants|journal=[[Angewandte Chemie]]|volume=46|issue=45|pages=8699–8702|pmid=17943948|pmc=2912502|doi=10.1002/anie.200703587}}</ref>

While absorption instruments have been proven over time to work well as a non-destructive test on many types of samples, they do have limitations.  Absorption technique limitations:
* The sample to be measured must completely cover the instrument’s aperture, with no holes.
* Samples must be thin enough to allow transmission of the measuring wavelengths of light.
* Surfaces must be relatively flat and uniform.
* Variable fluorescence (the [[Kautsky effect|Kautsky]] induction effect) caused by the red wavelength of absorption instruments, limits the repeatability of measurements at the same location.
* Selection of the measuring area, on smaller leaves, can cause measurement variations due to internal leaf structure variation. Veins and midribs can cause significant variation on samples.
* Wavelengths used in absorption methods, typically limit linear correlation with chemical chlorophyll content methods to concentration levels below 300&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=Gitelson/>

As a result, absorption instruments do not work with conifer needles, turf grasses, Arabidopsis leaves, moss, most CAM plants such as prickly pear cactus, and Agave, fruit, stems, petioles, lichens, and algae on rocks. Furthermore, it is difficult to get reliable readings on very small leaf plants such as immature rice and wheat.

A superior method is to measure the chlorophyll content using [[chlorophyll fluorescence]].
Gitelson (1999) states, "The ratio between [[chlorophyll fluorescence]],  at 735 nm and the wavelength range 700nm to 710 nm, F735/F700 was found to be linearly proportional to the chlorophyll content (with determination coefficient, r2, more than 0.95) and thus this ratio can be used as a precise indicator of chlorophyll content in plant leaves."<ref name=Gitelson>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0034-4257(99)00023-1 | title = The Chlorophyll Fluorescence Ratio F735/F700 as an Accurate Measure of the Chlorophyll Content in Plants | year = 1999 | last1 = Gitelson | first1 = Anatoly A | last2 = Buschmann | first2 = Claus | last3 = Lichtenthaler | first3 = Hartmut K | journal = Remote Sensing of Environment | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | page = 296}}</ref>  Non-destructive, hand-held meters use this effect to measure the chlorophyll content of samples where traditional absorbance techniques cannot be used.
This new method has many advantages over older, absorption techniques. These include:-
[[File:CCM300 being used to measure the chlorophyll content of small samples.jpg|thumb|Small samples can be analysed for chlorophyll content]]
#Samples do not need to fill the measuring aperture, so small samples can be measured.
# Samples do not need to allow transmission of the measuring beam, so thick samples can be measured.
# Surfaces do not need to be flat and uniform, so difficult plant morphologies can be measured.
# No [[Kautsky effect|Kautsky]] induction effect, so measurements can be repeated rapidly at the same site.
# Small sample area, so naturally occurring structures like mid ribs and veins can be avoided.
# Higher measuring range (675&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>, as opposed to 300&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> with absorption techniques), so many more samples can be measured.
[[File:CCM-300 brochure.ogv|thumb|Video clip of CCM300 being used.]]
By measuring [[chlorophyll fluorescence]], plant [[ecophysiology]] can be investigated. [[Chlorophyll fluorescence#Chlorophyll fluorometers|Chlorophyll fluorometers]] are used by plant researchers to assess plant stress.

==Biosynthesis==
{{Further|Protochlorophyllide}}
In plants, chlorophyll may be synthesized from [[succinyl-CoA]] and [[glycine]], although the immediate precursor to chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b'' is [[protochlorophyllide]]. In [[Angiosperm]] plants, the last step, conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll, is light-dependent and such plants are pale ([[etiolation|etiolated]]) if grown in the darkness. [[Non-vascular plant]]s and green algae have an additional light-independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness instead.

Chlorophyll itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide occurs mostly in the free form and, under light conditions, acts as a [[photosensitizer]], forming highly toxic [[free radicals]]. Hence, plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthesis pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide; so do the mutants with the damaged regulatory system.<ref>

{{Further|Chlorosis}}
Chlorosis is a condition in which [[leaf|leaves]] produce insufficient chlorophyll, turning them yellow. Chlorosis can be caused by a nutrient deficiency of [[Iron deficiency (plant disorder)|iron]]—called iron chlorosis—or by a shortage of [[magnesium deficiency (plants)|magnesium]] or [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen]].  Soil pH sometimes plays a role in nutrient-caused chlorosis; many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific pH levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on this.<ref>

Extracted liquid chlorophyll was considered to be unstable and always denatured until 1997,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} <!-- the patent citation does not support the "always denatured" claim --> when Frank S. & Lisa Sagliano used [[freeze-drying]] of liquid chlorophyll at the [[University of Florida]] and stabilized it as a powder, preserving it for future use.<ref>

==Alternative medicine==
There are many claims that are made about the healing properties of chlorophyll but most have been disproved or are exaggerated by the companies that are marketing them. Claims that chlorophyll is "the blood of plants" is simply incorrect and stems from the fact that it is similar in structure to [[Heme]] which is a component of [[haemoglobin]]. Quackwatch, a website dedicated to debunking false medical claims, has a quote from Teledo Blade which claims <ref>[http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/chlorophyll.html Amazing Claims for Chlorophyll], [[Quackwatch]]</ref> "Chlorophyll Held Useless As Body Deodorant"  Dec 10, 1952, <ref>"Chlorophyll Held Useless As Body Deodorant", Toledo Blade, Dec 10, 1952</ref> but later has John C. Kephart pointing out "No deodorant effect can possibly occur from the quantities of chlorophyll put in products such as gum, foot powder, cough drops, etc. To be effective, large doses must be given internally" [Journal of Ecological Botany 9:3, 1955].
