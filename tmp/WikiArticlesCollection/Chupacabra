The '''chupacabra''' or ({{IPA-es|tʃupaˈkaβɾa}}, from ''chupar'' "to suck" and ''cabra'' "goat", literally "goat sucker") is a [[legend]]ary [[cryptid]] rumored to inhabit parts of the Americas, with the first sightings reported in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name="Latino Bigfoot"/> The name comes from the animal's reported [[Vampirism|habit]] of attacking and [[Hematophagy|drinking the blood]] of [[livestock]], especially [[goat]]s.

Physical descriptions of the creature vary. It is purportedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail.

Eyewitness sightings have been claimed as early as 1995 in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as [[Maine]], and as far south as [[Chile]], and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like [[Russia]] and [[The Philippines]], but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence. Sightings in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as [[Canidae|canids]] afflicted by [[mange]].<ref name="Radford2011">Radford, Benjamin. 2011.

==History==
The first reported attacks occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico.<ref name="trail">{{cite web| author=Stephen Wagner| url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm| title=On the trail of the Chupacabras| accessdate=October 5, 2007}}</ref> In this attack, eight [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and completely drained of blood.<ref name="trail"/> A few months later, in August, an eyewitness, Madelyne Tolentino, reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico|Canóvanas]], when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed.<ref name="trail"/> In 1975, similar killings in the small town of [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] were attributed to ''El Vampiro de Moca'' (The Vampire of Moca).<ref>{{cite web| author=Stephen Wagner| url=http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm| title=Encounters with Chupacabras| accessdate=October 5, 2007}}</ref> Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[cult]]; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals were reported to have had their bodies bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] comedian and [[entrepreneur]] [[Silverio Pérez]] is credited with coining the term ''chupacabras'' soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], [[United States]], and [[Mexico]].<ref name="trail"/>

==Possible origin==
{{main|Tracking the Chupacabra}}
A five-year investigation by [[Benjamin Radford]] concluded that the description given by the original eyewitness in Puerto Rico, Madelyne Tolentino, was based on the creature Sil in the science-fiction horror film ''[[Species (film)|Species]]''.<ref name="Radford2011" /> The alien creature Sil is nearly identical to Tolentino’s chupacabra eyewitness account and she had seen the movie before her report: "It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all... The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive," Tolentino reported.<ref>Corrales, Scott. Chupacabras: And Other Mysteries. ISBN 1-883729-06-8</ref> Radford revealed that Tolentino "believed that the creatures and events she saw in ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' were actually happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time," and therefore concludes that "the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted."<ref name="Radford2011" /> This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.<ref>Radford, Benjamin. "Slaying the Vampire: Solving the ''Chupacabra'' Mystery" ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Vol. 35 No. 3, May/June 2011, Pages 45–48</ref>

In addition, the reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a [[necropsy]],<ref name="Radford2011" /> the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood. An analysis by a veterinarian of 300 reported victims of the chupacabra found that they had not been bled dry.

Radford divided the chupacabra reports into two categories:
* The reports from [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Latin America]] where animals were attacked and it is supposed their blood was extracted.
* The reports in the [[United States]] of [[mammal]]s, mostly dogs and [[coyote]]s with [[mange]], that people call "chupacabra" due to their unusual appearance.

In late October 2010, [[University of Michigan]] biologist Barry O'Connor concluded that all of the chupacabras reports in the United States were simply coyotes infected with the parasite [[Sarcoptes scabiei]], the symptoms of which would explain most of the features of the chupacabras: they would be left with little fur, thickened skin, and rank odour. O'Connor theorized the attacks on goats occurred "because these animals are greatly weakened, they're going to have a hard time hunting. So they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ur.umich.edu/1011/Oct25_10/1698-scary-chupacabras-monster |title=Scary chupacabras monster is as much victim as villain |publisher=umich.edu |date=2010-10-25 |accessdate=2011-12-24}}</ref>

Although several witnesses came to the conclusion that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect.<ref name="Radford2011" /> Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey.<ref name="Radford2011" /><ref name="Wade and Bowns">{{cite web|url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/about/procedures-for-evaluating/evaluation-of-suspected-predator-kills/ |title=Evaluation of Suspected Predator Kills  |accessdate=2011-12-24}}</ref> The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal [[bleeding]] or [[circulatory shock]].<ref name="Radford2011" /><ref name="Wade and Bowns" /> The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]], are to be expected since this is the only way that most land [[carnivores]] have to catch their prey.<ref name="Radford2011" />

==Reported sightings==
In July 2004, a rancher near [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], Texas, killed a hairless [[dog]]-like creature, which was attacking his livestock.<ref>{{cite web| author=Walker Robinson| url=http://www.woai.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=FAE91F84-A264AC3-8EA4-9097690CDEFC| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051109030151/http://www.woai.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=FAE91F84-A264AC3-8EA4-9097690CDEFC| archivedate=November 9, 2005| title=Chupacabra?

In October 2004, two more carcasses were found in the same area. [[Biology|Biologists]] in [[Texas]] examined samples from the two carcasses and determined they were also [[coyote]]s suffering from very severe cases of [[mange]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.banderasnews.com/0603/art-chupacabra.htm| title=Texas' Blood-Sucking Monster| accessdate=June 12, 2007}}</ref> In [[Coleman, Texas|Coleman]], Texas, a farmer named Reggie Lagow caught an animal in a trap he set up after the deaths of a number of his [[chicken]]s and [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]s. The animal was described as resembling a mix of hairless dog, [[rat]], and [[kangaroo]]. Lagow provided the animal to Texas Parks and Wildlife officials for identification, but Lagow reported in a September 17, 2006 phone interview with John Adolfi, founder of the Lost World Museum, that the "critter was caught on a Tuesday and thrown out in Thursday's trash."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbc4.tv/news/4895053/detail.html|title=Texas Farmer Claims He Caught Legendary 'Chupacabra'|publisher=KNBC Los Angeles|date=August 25, 2005}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>

In April 2006, ''MosNews'' reported that the chupacabras was spotted in Russia for the first time. Reports from [[Central Federal District|Central Russia]] beginning in March 2005 tell of a beast that kills animals and sucks out their blood. 32 turkeys were killed and drained overnight. Reports later came from neighboring villages when 30 sheep were killed and had their blood drained. Finally, eyewitnesses were able to describe the chupacabras. In May 2006, experts were determined to track the animal down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2006/04/27/chupacabra.shtml|title=Chupacabra the Goatsucker Vampire Sightings Reported in Central Russia|publisher=MosNews|date=April 17, 2006}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> According to Russian paranormal researcher [[Vadim Chernobrov]], the territory allegedly frequented by chupakabras lies in the [[Kharkov]] region of [[Ukraine]] and neighboring regions of Russia, but also in parts of Belorus and Poland. Recently the reports appeared of chupakabra-like attacks  in the Moscow region of Russia with dozens of birds and animals found bloodless, with strange incisions. At least twice the mysterious kangaroo-like creature ("with a crocodile head") attacked humans, causing no serious damage, though. According to Chernobrov,the two extraordinary things about chupakabra's ways are – the thing leaves a 'vanishing' line of footprints, looking as if it takes off as a bird, and also it tends  occasionally to assort its victim's bodies 'aesthetically', often by colour and size, or build pyramids with killed bodies.<ref name="gov">{{cite web | author = | date = | url  = http://planeta.moy.su/blog/govorim_i_pokazyvaem_chto_za_monstr_02_11_2012/2012-11-04-34142|title = What’s This Beast?| publisher  = NTV Russia.

In mid-August 2006, Michelle O'Donnell of [[Turner, Maine|Turner]], Maine, described an "evil looking" rodent-like animal with fangs that had been found dead alongside a road. The animal was apparently struck by a car, and was unidentifiable. Photographs were taken and witness reports seem to be in relative agreement that the creature was canine in appearance, but in widely published photos seemed unlike any dog or [[Gray Wolf|wolf]] in the area. Photos from other angles seem to show a [[Chow Chow|chow]]- or [[akita (dog)|akita]]-mixed breed dog. It was reported that "the carcass was picked clean by [[vulture]]s before experts could examine it". For years, residents of [[Maine]] have reported a mysterious creature and a string of dog maulings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MYSTERY_BEAST?SITE=WWL&TEMPLATE=STRANGEHEADS.html&SECTION=HOME| title='Hybrid Mutant' Found Dead in Maine|work=Associated Press|date=August 16, 2006}}{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref>

In August 2007, [[Cuero, Texas#Sighting of Chupacabra in 2007 and 2008|Phylis Canion]] found three animals in [[Cuero, Texas|Cuero]], Texas. She and her neighbors reported to have discovered three strange animal carcasses outside Canion's property.

State [[Mammalogy|Mammologist]] John Young estimated that the animal in Canion's pictures was a [[Gray Fox]] suffering from an extreme case of [[mange]]. In November 2007, biology researchers at [[Texas State University–San Marcos]] determined from DNA samples that the suspicious animal was a coyote.<ref name="CueroDNA">{{cite news|url=http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2007/11/Chupacabra110107.html| title=Texas State researchers solve mystery of Cuero chupacabra|publisher=Texas State University News Service|date=November 1, 2007}}</ref> The coyote, however, had grayish-blue, mostly hairless skin and large fanged teeth, which caused it to appear different from a normal coyote.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,307576,00.html|title=Texas Woman Claims to Have Found Mythical 'Chupacabra'|work=Foxnews.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 27, 2009 | date=November 2, 2007}}</ref> Additional skin samples were taken to attempt to determine the cause of the hair loss.<ref name="CueroDNA"/>

On January 11, 2008, a sighting was reported at the province of [[Capiz]] in the [[Philippines]]. Some of the residents from the [[barangay]] believed that it was the chupacabras that killed eight chickens.

Neither test animal matched the creature in the video. The team had also tested a DNA sample taken from an alleged carcass of one of the creatures found by a local rancher which was later identified as being a hybrid wolf/coyote.

In September 2009, [[CNN]] aired a report showing closeup video footage of an unidentified dead animal. The same CNN report stated that locals have begun speculating the possibility that this might be a chupacabras. A [[Blanco, Texas|Blanco]], [[Texas]], taxidermist reported that he received the body from a former student whose cousin had discovered the animal in his barn, where it had succumbed to poison left out for rodents. The taxidermist expressed his belief that this is a genetically mutated coyote.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/offbeat/2009/09/01/roldan.chupacabra.KSAT?iref=videosearch CNN video report], 9/3/09.</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/09/03/animal.mystery.chupacabra/index.html Texas mystery: 'Defective coyote' or chupacabra?], CNN, September 4, 2009.</ref>

On September 18, 2009, taxidermist Jerry Ayer sold the Blanco Texas Chupacabra to the Lost World Museum. The museum, as reported in the Syracuse Post Standard on 9/26/09, is placing the creature on display as they work with an unnamed university to have the remains tested.

On July 4, 2011, Jack (Jeff) Crabtree, of Lake Jackson, Texas, reported seeing a chupacabra in his back yard. At first, Crabtree stood firmly on his original theory of the chupacabra, but after the local newspaper and several other media reporters wrote his story on July 11, he quickly backed down, agreeing with wildlife experts that it was most likely a [[coyote]] with mange. "It was a spoof or a practical joke," Crabtree said. "...I really didn't believe it."

On September 17, 2013, the Fox 2 News affiliate in Saint Louis, Missouri, posted on their website a report of two sightings. In the first, a woman spotted a "small grey dog-like animal" near the front gate of the Old Lake Hill Speedway in Saint Louis. A week previously, a hunter claimed to have killed a chupacabra while "coon hunting". The Mississippi Department of Wildlife said that it was a dog with mange.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fox2now.com/2013/09/17/chupacabra-spotted-in-valley-park/|title=Woman claims to have spotted a "Chupacabra" in St. Louis|work=fox2now.com|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref>

==Appearance==
The most common description of the chupacabra is a [[reptile]]-like creature, appearing to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/chupa.html|title=Chupacabras Biography|accessdate=May 10, 2007}}</ref> This form stands approximately 3 to 4 feet (1 to 1.2 m) high, and stands and hops in a similar fashion to a [[kangaroo]].<ref name="top ten">{{cite web| author=Stephen Wagner| url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa010101b.htm| title=The Top 10 Most Mysterious Creatures of Modern Times | accessdate=October 5, 2007}}</ref> In at least one sighting, the creature was reported to hop 20 feet (6 m). This variety is said to have a dog or [[Leopard|panther]]-like nose and face, a [[forked tongue]], and large fangs. It is said to hiss and screech when alarmed, as well as leave behind a [[sulfur]]ic stench.<ref name="top ten"/> When it screeches, some reports assert that the chupacabras' eyes glow an unusual red which gives the witnesses nausea.

Another description of chupacabras, although not as common, describes a strange breed of wild dog.<ref name="top ten"/> This form is mostly hairless and has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. It is claimed that this breed might be an example of a dog-like reptile. Unlike conventional predators, the chupacabra is said to drain all of the animal's blood (and sometimes organs) usually through three holes in the shape of an upside-down triangle or through one or two holes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tomás De Jesús Mangual| url=http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&n=23285| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011110443/http://vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&n=23285| archivedate=2007-10-11| title=Imputan otro ataque al Chupacabras| publisher=El Vocero| date=January 9, 2006| accessdate=October 5, 2007}}</ref>

==Naming convention==
''Chupacabras'' can be translated as "goat-sucker". It is known as both ''chupacabras'' and ''chupacabra'' throughout the Americas, with the former being the original word,<ref name="Clave">Diccionario Clave, [http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&cadena=chupacabras chupacabras]. It states that both singular and plural is ''chupacabras''.</ref> and the latter a [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of it. The name in Spanish can be preceded by singular masculine article (''el chupacabras''), or the plural masculine article (''los chupacabras'').

==Related legends==
A popular legend in [[New Orleans]] concerns a popular lovers' lane called Grunch Road, which was said to be inhabited by "grunches", creatures similar in appearance to the ''Chupacabra''.

The [[Peuchen]] of [[Chile]] also share similarities in their supposed habits, but instead of being dog-like they are described as winged snakes. This legend may have originated from the [[vampire bat]], an animal endemic to the region.<ref name=peuchen1>[http://www.diarioelcentro.cl/articulos_sc.php?fecha=26-07-2004&semana=29-2004 Article: Tras los pasos del chupacabras.

In the [[Philippines]], another [[legendary creature]] called the [[Sigbin]] shares many of the same descriptions as the ''Chupacabra''.

==In popular culture==
