The usual form of baptism among [[Early Christians|the earliest Christians]] was for the candidate to be [[immersion baptism|immersed]], either totally (submerged completely under the water) or partially (standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her).<ref>It is a controversy whether baptism was performed by total or partial immersion. Described by various scholars:
*"In the early centuries baptism was usually by immersion. However, this need not have meant full submersion in the water.

Today, some Christians, particularly [[Christian Scientists]], [[Quakers]], the [[Salvation Army]], and [[Unitarians]], do not see baptism as necessary, and do not practice the rite. Among those that do, differences can be found in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the understanding of the significance of the rite. Most Christians baptize "in the name of the [[God the Father|Father]], and of the [[God the Son|Son]], and of the [[Holy Spirit]]"<ref>[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/TextContents/Index/4/SubIndex/67/TextIndex/7 Rite for the Baptism of One Child]</ref> (following the [[Great Commission]]), but some baptize in [[Jesus' Name doctrine|Jesus' name only]].

Some insist on submersion or at least partial immersion of the person who is baptized, others consider that any form of washing by water, as long as the water flows on the head, is sufficient.

==Mode and manner==

Baptism is practiced in several different ways. [[Aspersion]] is the sprinkling of water on the head, and [[affusion]] is the pouring of water over the head.

The word "[[immersion baptism|immersion]]" is derived from [[late Latin]] ''immersionem'', a noun derived from the verb ''immergere'' (''in'' – "into" + ''mergere'' "dip"). In relation to baptism, some use it to refer to any form of dipping, whether the body is put completely under water or is only partly dipped in water; they thus speak of immersion as being either total or partial. Others, of the Anabaptist tradition, use "immersion" to mean exclusively plunging someone entirely under the surface of the water.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=immersion Online Etymology Dictionary].

===Meaning of the Greek verb ''baptizein''===
The [[Greek-English Lexicon]] of Liddell and Scott gives the primary meaning of the verb ''baptizein'', from which the English verb "baptize" is derived, as "dip, plunge", and gives examples of plunging a sword into a throat or an embryo and for drawing wine by dipping a cup in the bowl; for New Testament usage it gives two meanings: "baptize", with which it associates the [[Septuagint]] mention of [[Naaman]] dipping himself in the [[Jordan River]], and "perform ablutions", as in {{bibleverse||Luke|11:38}}.<ref name="LSJ">[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=bapti/zw Liddell & Scott: entry βαπτίζω]: "βαπτ-ίζω, A. dip, plunge, 'ξίφος εἰς σφαγήν' J.BJ2.18.4; 'σπάθιον εἰς τὸ ἔμβρυον' Sor.2.63:—Pass., of a [[trepanning|trephine]], Gal.10.447; ... 2. draw wine by dipping the cup in the bowl, Aristopho 14.5; 'φιάλαις β. ἐκ . . κρατήρων' ..." The usage examples quoted here mean "a sword into his throat"; "a sword into the foetus"; "draw with cups from bowls"</ref>

"While it is true that the basic root meaning of the Greek words for baptize and baptism is immerse/immersion, it is not true that the words can simply be reduced to this meaning, as can be seen from {{bibleverse||Mark|10:38-39}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|12:50}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|3:11}}//{{bibleverse||Luke|3:16}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|10:2}}."<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Dyrness+%22baptism+any+less+valid%22&btnG= William A.

Two passages in the [[Gospel]]s indicate that the verb ''baptizein'' did not always indicate submersion. The first is {{Bibleref2|Luke|11:38}}, which tells how a Pharisee, at whose house Jesus ate, "was astonished to see that he did not first wash (''ἐβαπτίσθη'', aorist passive of ''βαπτίζω''—literally, "be baptized") before dinner". This is the passage that Liddell and Scott cites as an instance of the use of ''{{lang|grc|βαπτίζω}}'' to mean ''perform ablutions''. Jesus' omission of this action is similar to that of his disciples: "Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash (''{{lang|grc|νίπτω}}'') not their hands when they eat bread" ({{bibleref2|Mt|15:1–2|KJV}}). The other Gospel passage pointed to is: "The Pharisees…do not eat unless they wash (''{{lang|grc|νίπτω}}'', the ordinary word for washing) their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they wash themselves (literally, "baptize themselves"—''βαπτίσωνται'', passive or middle voice of ''βαπτίζω'')" ({{bibleref2|Mk|7:3–4|KJV}}).

===Apparel===
Until the [[Middle Ages]], most baptisms were performed with the candidates naked—as is evidenced by most of the early portrayals of baptism (some of which are shown in this article), and the early Church Fathers and other Christian writers. Deaconesses helped female candidates for reasons of modesty.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/aroseby.txt]</ref>

Typical of these is [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] who wrote "On the Mysteries of Baptism" in the 4th century (c. 350&nbsp;AD):

{{quotation|Do you not know, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death? etc.…for you are not under the Law, but under grace.

1. Therefore, I shall necessarily lay before you the sequel of yesterday's Lecture, that you may learn of what those things, which were done by you in the inner chamber, were symbolic.

2. As soon, then, as you entered, you put off your tunic; and this was an image of putting off the old man with his deeds.{{Bibleref2c|Col|3:9}} Having stripped yourselves, you were naked; in this also imitating Christ, who was stripped naked on the Cross, and by His nakedness put off from Himself the principalities and powers, and openly triumphed over them on the tree. For since the adverse powers made their lair in your members, you may no longer wear that old garment; I do not at all mean this visible one, but the old man, which waxes corrupt in the lusts of deceit.{{Bibleref2c|Eph|4:22}} May the soul which has once put him off, never again put him on, but say with the Spouse of Christ in the Song of Songs, I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on?{{Bibleref2c|SongofS|5:3|| Song of Sol 5:3}} O wondrous thing! You were naked in the sight of all, and were not ashamed; for truly ye bore the likeness of the first-formed Adam, who was naked in the garden, and was not ashamed.

3. Then, when you were stripped, you were anointed with exorcised oil, from the very hairs of your head to your feet, and were made partakers of the good olive-tree, Jesus Christ.

4. After these things, you were led to the holy pool of Divine Baptism, as Christ was carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is before our eyes. And each of you was asked, whether he believed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and you made that saving confession, and descended three times into the water, and ascended again; here also hinting by a symbol at the three days burial of Christ.… And at the self-same moment you were both dying and being born;<ref>Cyril of Jerusalem, Catechetical Lecture 20 (On the Mysteries. II. of Baptism) {{Bibleref2|Romans|6:3–14}} http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310120.htm</ref>}}

The symbolism is threefold:

1. Baptism is considered to be a form of rebirth—"by water and the Spirit"{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:5}}—the nakedness of baptism (the second birth) paralleled the condition of one's original birth. For example, St. John Chrysostom calls the baptism "λοχείαν", i.e., giving birth, and "new way of creation…from water and Spirit" ("to John" speech 25,2), and later elaborates:

: {{Quote|For nothing perceivable was handed over to us by Jesus; but with perceivable things, all of them however conceivable. This is also the way with the baptism; the gift of the water is done with a perceivable thing, but the things being conducted, i.e., the rebirth and renovation, are conceivable. For, if you were without a body, He would hand over these bodiless gifts as naked [gifts] to you. But because the soul is closely linked to the body, He hands over the perceivable ones to you with conceivable things. (Chrysostom to Matthew., speech 82, 4, c. 390&nbsp;A.D.)}}

2. The removal of clothing represented the "image of putting off the old man with his deeds" (as per Cyril, above), so the stripping of the body before for baptism represented taking off the trappings of sinful self, so that the "new man", which is given by Jesus, can be put on.

3. As St. Cyril again asserts above, as Adam and Eve in scripture and tradition were naked, innocent and unashamed in the Garden of Eden, nakedness during baptism was seen as a renewal of that innocence and state of original sinlessness. Other parallels can also be drawn, such as between the exposed condition of Christ during His crucifixion, and the crucifixion of the "old man" of the repentant sinner in preparation for baptism.

Changing customs and concerns regarding modesty probably contributed to the practice of permitting or requiring the baptismal candidate to either retain their undergarments (as in many Renaissance paintings of baptism such as those by da Vinci, Tintoretto, Van Scorel, Masaccio, de Wit and others) and/or to wear, as is almost universally the practice today, baptismal robes. These robes are most often white, symbolizing purity. Some groups today allow any suitable clothes to be worn, such as trousers and a t-shirt—practical considerations include how easily the clothes will dry (denim is discouraged), and whether they will become see-through when wet.

==Meaning and effects==
[[File:Baptême Cathédrale de Troyes 290308.jpg|thumb|Baptism of [[Augustine of Hippo]] as represented in a sculptural group in [[Troyes]] cathedral (1549)]]
There are differences in views about the effect of baptism for a Christian. Some Christian groups assert baptism is a requirement for salvation and a [[sacrament]], and speak of "[[baptismal regeneration]]". Its importance may be understood by an informed knowledge of their interpretation of the most fundamental and basic meaning of the "Mystical Body of Christ" as found in the New Testament. This view is shared by the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] traditions, and by Churches formed early during the [[Protestant Reformation]] such as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]. For example, [[Martin Luther]] said:

{{Quote|To put it most simply, the power, effect, benefit, fruit, and purpose of Baptism is to save. No one is baptized in order to become a prince, but as the words say, to "be saved". To be saved, we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil and to enter into the kingdom of Christ and live with him forever.|''[[Luther's Large Catechism]]'', 1529}}

The [[Churches of Christ]],"<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" />{{rp|p.66}}<ref name="Theology Matters"/>{{rp|p.112}} [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also espouse baptism as necessary for salvation.

For Roman Catholics, baptism by water is a sacrament of initiation into the life of the children of God (''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', 1212–13). It configures the person to Christ (CCC 1272), and obliges the Christian to share in the Church's apostolic and missionary activity (CCC 1270). The Catholic Tradition holds that there are three types of baptism by which one can be saved: sacramental baptism (with water), baptism of desire (explicit or implicit desire to be part of the Church founded by Jesus Christ), and baptism of blood ([[martyrdom]]). In his encyclical ''[[Mystici Corporis Christi]]'' of 29 June 1943, [[Pope Pius XII]] spoke of baptism and profession of the true faith as what makes members of the one true Church, which is the body of Jesus Christ himself, as God the Holy Spirit has taught through the Apostle Paul:
{{Quote|
:'''18'''...''Through the waters of Baptism those who are born into this world dead in sin are not only born again and made members of the Church, but being stamped with a spiritual seal they become able and fit to receive the other Sacraments. ...'' 
:'''22''' ''Actually only those are to be included as members of the Church who have been baptized and profess the true faith, and who have not been so unfortunate as to separate themselves from the unity of the Body, or been excluded by legitimate authority for grave faults committed. 'For in one spirit' says the Apostle, 'were we all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free.' As therefore in the true Christian community there is only one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one Baptism, so there can be only one faith. And therefore if a man refuse to hear the Church let him be considered—so the Lord commands—as a heathen and a publican. It follows that those are divided in faith or government cannot be living in the unity of such a Body, nor can they be living the life of its one Divine Spirit.'' |[http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P12MYSTI.HTM ''Mystici Corporis Christi'' (full text in an English translation)]}}

By contrast, [[Anabaptist]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Protestants recognize baptism as an outward sign of an inward reality following on an individual believer's experience of forgiving grace. [[Reformed]] and [[Methodist]] Protestants maintain a link between baptism and regeneration, but insist that it is not automatic or mechanical, and that regeneration may occur at a different time than baptism.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Faith of the Christian Church|last=Inbody|first=Tyron|year=2005|url=http://www.questia.com/read/119924426/the-faith-of-the-christian-church-an-introduction|publisher=William B. Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|page=299}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>

[[Churches of Christ]] consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do."<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" />{{rp|p.66}} Thus, they see baptism as a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God".<ref name="Theology Matters">Harold Hazelip, Gary Holloway, Randall J. Harris, Mark C. Black, ''Theology Matters: In Honor of Harold Hazelip: Answers for the Church Today'', College Press, 1998, ISBN 0-89900-813-5, ISBN 978-0-89900-813-4, 368 pages</ref>{{rp|p.112}}

===Christian traditions===
[[File:BaptismalFontStRaphaelDubuque.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|The baptistry at [[St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque)|St. Raphael's Cathedral]], [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], Iowa. This particular font was expanded in 2005 to include a small pool to provide for immersion baptism of adults. Eight-sided font architectures are common symbology of the day of Christ's Resurrection: the "Eighth Day".]]

The [[liturgy]] of baptism in the Catholic, [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] traditions makes clear reference to baptism as not only a symbolic burial and resurrection, but an actual supernatural transformation, one that draws parallels to the experience of [[Noah]] and the passage of the [[Israelites]] through the [[Red Sea]] divided by [[Moses]]. Thus, baptism is literally and symbolically not only cleansing, but also dying and rising again with Christ. Catholics believe that baptism is necessary for the cleansing of the taint of [[original sin]], and for that reason infant baptism is a common practice. The Eastern Churches ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]) also baptize infants on the basis of texts, such as {{bibleref2|Matthew|19:14}}, which are interpreted as supporting full Church membership for children. In these traditions, baptism is immediately followed by [[Chrismation]] and [[Eucharist|Communion]] at the next [[Divine Liturgy]], regardless of age. Orthodox likewise believe that baptism removes what they call the ancestral sin of Adam.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Nicodemos the Hagiorite]] |title=Concerning Thoughts |work=Exomologetarion |url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/exo_thoughts.aspx}}</ref> Anglicans believe that Baptism is also the entry into the Church and therefore allows them access to all rights and responsibilities as full members, including the privilege to receive Holy Communion. Most Methodists and Anglicans agree that it also cleanses the taint of what in the West is called original sin, in the East ancestral sin.

Eastern Orthodox Christians usually insist on complete threefold immersion as both a symbol of death and rebirth into Christ, and as a washing away of sin. [[Latin Rite]] Catholics generally baptize by affusion (pouring); Eastern Catholics usually by submersion, or at least partial immersion. However, submersion is gaining in popularity within the Latin Catholic Church. In newer church sanctuaries, the baptismal font may be designed to expressly allow for baptism by immersion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Anglicans baptize by submersion, immersion, affusion or sprinkling.

According to a tradition, evidence of which can be traced back to at latest about the year 200,<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[Tertullian]] |editor=[[Philip Schaff]] |title=[[Ante-Nicene Fathers]] |chapter=Of the Persons to Whom, and the Time When, Baptism is to Be Administered |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.vi.iii.xviii.html}}</ref> sponsors or godparents are present at baptism and vow to uphold the Christian education and life of the baptized.

Baptists argue that the Greek word {{lang|grc|βαπτίζω}} originally meant "to immerse". They interpret some Biblical passages concerning baptism as requiring submersion of the body in water. They also state that only submersion reflects the symbolic significance of being "buried" and "raised" with Christ.{{bibleref2c|Rom|6:3–4}} Baptist Churches baptize in the name of the [[Trinity]]—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. However, they do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation; but rather that it is an act of Christian obedience.

Some "[[Full Gospel]]" [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] churches such as [[Oneness Pentecostal]]s baptize only in the name of Jesus Christ, citing Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus as their authority.{{Bibleref2c|Ac|2:38}} They also point to several historical sources that maintain that the early church always baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus until development of the Trinity Doctrine in the 2nd century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apostolic.net/biblicalstudies/name.htm |title=Baptism in Jesus' Name |publisher=Apostolic Network |accessdate=February 25, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090302205741/http://apostolic.net/biblicalstudies/name.htm| archivedate= March 02 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apostolic-voice.org/tracts/water_baptism.htm |title=Water Baptism in Jesus' Name is Essential unto Salvation |accessdate=February 26, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090404042305/http://www.apostolic-voice.org/tracts/water_baptism.htm| archivedate= April 04 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}</ref>

===Ecumenical statements===
In 1982 the [[World Council of Churches]] published the [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical]] paper ''[[Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry]]''. The preface of the document states:

{{quotation|Those who know how widely the churches have differed in doctrine and practice on baptism, Eucharist and ministry, will appreciate the importance of the large measure of agreement registered here. Virtually all the confessional traditions are included in the Commission's membership. That theologians of such widely different traditions should be able to speak so harmoniously about baptism, Eucharist and ministry is unprecedented in the modern ecumenical movement. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the Commission also includes among its full members theologians of the Catholic and other churches which do not belong to the World Council of Churches itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry.html#c10471 |title=Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry—Faith and Order Paper No. 111 |publisher=[[World Council of Churches]] |year=1982 |accessdate=March 1, 2009}}</ref>}}

A 1997 document, ''Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism'', gave the views of a commission of experts brought together under the aegis of the World Council of Churches. It states:

{{Quote|…according to {{bibleref2|Acts|2:38}}, baptisms follow from Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus and lead those baptized to the receiving of Christ's Spirit, the Holy Ghost, and life in the community: "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers"{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|2:42|RSV}} as well as to the distribution of goods to those in need.{{bibleref2c-nb|Acts|2:45}}}}

Those who heard, who were baptized and entered the community's life, were already made witnesses of and partakers in the promises of God for the last days: the forgiveness of sins through baptism in the name of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on all flesh.{{bibleref2c|Ac|2:38}} Similarly, in what may well be a baptismal pattern, [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] testifies that proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and teaching about new life{{bibleref2c|1Pe|1:3–21||1 Pe 1:3–21}} lead to purification and new birth.{{bibleref2c-nb|1Pe.|1:22–23||1 Pet. 1:22–23}} This, in turn, is followed by eating and drinking [[Holy Communion|God's food]],{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:2–3||1 Pet. 2:2–3}} by participation in the life of the community—the royal priesthood, the new temple, the people of God{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:4–10||1 Pet. 2:4–10}}—and by further moral formation.{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:11ff||1 Pet. 2:11 ff.}} At the beginning of 1 Peter the writer sets this baptism in the context of obedience to Christ and sanctification by the Spirit.{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|1:2||1 Pet. 1:2}} So baptism into Christ is seen as baptism into the Spirit.<sup>{{color|blue|cf. }}</sup>{{bibleref2c|1Cor|12:13||1 Co 12:13}} In the fourth gospel Jesus' discourse with [[Nicodemus]] indicates that birth by water and Spirit becomes the gracious means of entry into the place where God rules. {{bibleref2c|Jn|3:5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/index.php?id=2672 |title=Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism |publisher=[[World Council of Churches]] |year=1997 |accessdate=May 13, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070509161956/http://www.oikoumene.org/index.php?id=2672| archivedate= May 09 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Validity considerations by some churches===
[[File:Окрещённый ребёнок.jpg|thumb|[[Russian Orthodox]] priest greeting an infant and its godparents on the steps of the church at the beginning of the [[Sacred Mystery]] of Baptism.]]

Since the Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Methodist and Lutheran churches teach that baptism is a [[sacrament]] that has actual spiritual and salvific effects, certain key criteria must be complied with for it to be valid, i.e., to actually have those effects. If these key criteria are met, violation of some rules regarding baptism, such as varying the authorized rite for the ceremony, renders the baptism illicit (contrary to the church's laws) but still valid.

One of the criteria for validity is use of the correct form of words. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the use of the verb "baptize" is essential.<ref name="cathen" /> Catholics of the [[Latin Rite]], Anglicans and Methodists use the form "I baptize you…." Eastern Orthodox and some [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] use the form "The Servant/(Handmaiden) of God is baptized in the name of...." or "This person is baptized by my hands…." These churches generally recognize each other's form of baptism as valid.

Most [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches consider the baptisms of Catholic and [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches to be valid, therefore converts from those churches are received through the [[sacrament]] of [[Chrismation]]. Not all Eastern Orthodox churches consider the baptismal rites of Protestants as valid. Therefore Protestant converts would be received into the church through Baptism and Chrismation regardless of prior Protestant baptism. Most [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches follow similar rules.

Use of the [[Trinitarian formula]] "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" is also considered essential; thus these churches do not accept as valid baptisms of non-[[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] churches such as [[Oneness Pentecostals]].

Another essential condition is use of water. A baptism in which some liquid that would not usually be called water, such as wine, milk, soup or fruit juice was used would not be considered valid.<ref name=Fanning/>

Another requirement is that the celebrant intends to perform baptism. This requirement entails merely the intention "to do what the Church does",<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1256]</ref> not necessarily to have Christian faith, since it is not the person baptizing, but the Holy Spirit working through the sacrament, who produces the effects of the sacrament. Doubt about the faith of the baptizer is thus no ground for doubt about the validity of the baptism.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/DOCTRINE/INTENTIO.TXT On the Intention Required in the Minister of the Sacraments]</ref>

Some conditions expressly do not affect validity—for example, whether submersion, immersion, affusion or aspersion is used. However, if water is sprinkled, there is a danger that the water may not touch the skin of the unbaptized. As has been stated, "it is not sufficient for the water to merely touch the candidate; it must also flow, otherwise there would seem to be no real ablution. At best, such a baptism would be considered doubtful. If the water touches only the hair, the sacrament has probably been validly conferred, though in practice the safer course must be followed. If only the clothes of the person have received the aspersion, the baptism is undoubtedly void."<ref name=Fanning>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm William Fanning, "Baptism" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1907)]</ref>

For many communions, validity is not affected if a single submersion or pouring is performed rather than a triple, but in Orthodoxy this is controversial.

According to the Catholic Church, baptism imparts an [[sacramental character|indelible "seal"]] upon the soul of the baptized and therefore a person who has already been baptized cannot be validly baptized again. This teaching was affirmed against the [[Donatist]]s who practiced rebaptism. The grace received in baptism is believed to operate ''ex opere operato'' and is therefore considered valid even if administered in heretical or schismatic groups.<ref name="ODWR">{{Cite book|first=John |last=Bowker |authorlink=John Bowker (theologian) |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-866242-4 |oclc=60181672}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>

===Recognition by other denominations===
The Catholic, [[Lutheran]], [[Anglican]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Methodist]] Churches accept baptism performed by other denominations within this group as valid, subject to certain conditions, including the use of the Trinitarian formula. It is only possible to be baptized once, thus people with valid baptisms from other denominations may not be baptized again upon conversion or transfer. Such people are accepted upon making a profession of faith and, if they have not yet validly received the sacrament of confirmation or chrismation, by being confirmed. In some cases it can be difficult to decide if the original baptism was in fact valid; if there is doubt, [[conditional baptism]] is administered, with a formula on the lines of "If you are not yet baptized, I baptize you…."<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2W.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 869]; cf.

In the still recent past, it was common practice in the Roman Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from Protestantism because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete case. In the case of the major Protestant Churches, agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestant tradition. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the Churches of [[Eastern Christianity]], but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html |title=Response of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher=Vatican.va |date=June 5, 2001 |accessdate=February 25, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090223230027/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html| archivedate= February 23, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Practice in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] for converts from other communions is not uniform. However, generally baptisms performed in the name of the Holy Trinity are accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church. If a convert has not received the sacrament (mysterion) of baptism, he or she must be baptised in the name of the Holy Trinity before they may enter into communion with the Orthodox Church. If he has been baptized in another Christian confession (other than Orthodox Christianity)his previous baptism is considered retroactively filled with grace by [[chrismation]] or, in rare circumstances, [[confession of faith]] alone as long as the baptism was done in the name of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The exact procedure is dependent on local [[canon law|canons]] and is the subject of some controversy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es recognise the validity of baptisms performed within the Eastern Orthodox Communion. Some also recognise baptisms performed by Catholic Churches. Any supposed baptism not performed using the Trinitarian formula is considered invalid.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

There is debate among Christian churches as to who can administer baptism. The examples given in the New Testament only show apostles and deacons administering baptism. Ancient Christian churches interpret this as indicating that baptism should be performed by the clergy except ''in extremis'', i.e., [[emergency baptism|when the one being baptized is in immediate danger of death]]. Then anyone may baptize, provided, in the view of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the person who does the baptizing is a member of that Church, or, in the view of the Catholic Church, that the person, even if not baptized, intends to do what the Church does in administering the rite. Many Protestant churches see no specific prohibition in the biblical examples and permit any believer to baptize another.

In the Roman Catholic Church, [[canon law]] for the [[Latin Rite]] lays down that the ordinary minister of baptism is a bishop, priest or deacon,<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM canon 861 §1]</ref> but its administration is one of the functions "especially entrusted to the [[priest|parish priest]]".<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1T.HTM#18G canon 530]</ref> If the person to be baptized is at least fourteen years old, that person's baptism is to be referred to the bishop, so that he can decide whether to confer the baptism himself.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM canon 863]</ref> If no ordinary minister is available, a [[catechist]] or some other person whom the local [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] has appointed for this purpose may licitly do the baptism; indeed in a case of necessity ''any'' person (irrespective of that person's religion) who has the requisite intention may confer the baptism<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM canon 861 §2]</ref>  By "a case of necessity" is meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. "The requisite intention" is, at the minimum level, the intention "to do what the Church does" through the rite of baptism.

In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister. Administration of the sacrament is reserved to the Parish Priest or to another priest to whom he or the local [[ordinary (officer)|hierarch]] grants permission, a permission that can be presumed if in accordance with canon law. However, "in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/__PIT.HTM |title=Canon 677 |work=[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] |year=1990 |accessdate=February 26, 2009}}</ref>

The discipline of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] is similar to that of the Eastern Catholic Churches. They require the baptizer, even in cases of necessity, to be of their own faith, on the grounds that a person cannot convey what he himself does not possess, in this case membership in the Church.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ware |first=Kallistos |authorlink=Timothy Ware |year=1964 |title=The Orthodox Church |page=285 |location=New York City |publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}</ref> The Latin Rite Catholic Church does not insist on this condition, considering that the effect of the sacrament, such as membership of the Church, is not produced by the person who baptizes, but by the Holy Spirit. For the Orthodox, while Baptism ''in extremis'' may be administered by a deacon or any lay-person, if the newly baptized person survives, a priest must still perform the other prayers of the Rite of Baptism, and administer the [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] of [[Chrismation]].

The discipline of [[Anglicanism]] and [[Lutheranism]] is similar to that of the Latin Rite Catholic Church. For [[Methodists]] and many other Protestant denominations, too, the ordinary minister of baptism is a duly ordained or appointed minister of religion.

Newer movements of Protestant [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches, particularly non-denominational, allow laypeople to baptize.

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], only a man who has been ordained to the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic Priesthood]] holding the priesthood office of [[Priest (Mormonism)|Priest]] or higher office in the [[Melchizedek Priesthood]] may administer baptism.<ref name="lds.org">"Aaronic Priesthood", ''Priesthood and Auxiliary Leaders’ Guidebook'', © 1992, 2001 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc., [http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=true&locale=0&sourceId=9a230f9856c20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&vgnextoid=198bf4b13819d110VgnVCM1000003a94610aRCRD#38 As Retrieved September 16, 2009], "Brethren who hold the Aaronic Priesthood have authority to perform certain priesthood ordinances. Priests may perform baptisms"</ref>

A [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] baptism is performed by a "dedicated male" adherent.<ref name="autogenerated480">"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, page 480, "In connection with baptism, it may also be noted that a baptism may be performed by a dedicated male even though no other human witnesses are present."</ref><ref>"The General Priesthood Today", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1963, page 147, "Because he is a minister, any competent male member is called on to perform funerals, baptisms and weddings, and to conduct the service in annual commemoration of the Lord’s death."</ref> Only in extraordinary circumstances would a "dedicated" baptizer be unbaptized (see section ''[[#Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witnesses]]'').

==Specific Christian groups practicing baptism==

===Anabaptist===
[[File:River baptism in New Bern.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A river baptism in [[North Carolina]] at the turn of the 20th century. Full-immersion (submersion) baptism continues to be a common practice in many African-American Christian congregations today.]]

[[Anabaptist]]s ("re-baptizers") and [[Baptists]] promote adult baptism, or "[[believer's baptism]]". Baptism is seen as an act identifying one as having accepted Jesus Christ as Savior.

Early Anabaptists were given that name because they re-baptized persons who they felt had not been properly baptized, having received infant baptism, sprinkling.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anabaptist | title = Online Etymological Dictionary | origyear = 2001 | year = 2010 | first = Douglas | last = Harper | contribution = Anabaptist | accessdate = 6 August 2013}}.</ref>

Anabaptists perform baptisms indoors in a baptismal font, a swimming pool, or a bathtub, or outdoors in a creek or river. Baptism memorializes the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.{{bibleref2c|Rom|6}} Baptism does not accomplish anything in itself, but is an outward personal sign or testimony that the person's sins have already been washed away by the cross of Christ.<ref name="London">''London Baptist Confession of 1644.''

===Baptist===
For the majority of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.{{Bibleref2c|Mt|28:19}} It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to the believer's faith in the final resurrection of the dead.<ref name="BFM">"The Baptist Faith and Message," Southern Baptist Convention. Adopted, June 14, 2000.

Churches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do."<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" />{{rp|p.66}} Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God."<ref name="Theology Matters" />{{rp|p.112}} While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a "sacrament", their view of it can legitimately be described as "sacramental."<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" />{{rp|p.66}}<ref name="Baptism, Why Wait?" />{{rp|p.186}} They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself,<ref name="Baptism, Why Wait?" />{{rp|p.186}} and understand baptism to be an integral part of the conversion process, rather than just a symbol of conversion.<ref name="Baptism, Why Wait?" />{{rp|p.184}} A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as just a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as "the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation."<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" />{{rp|p.66}} There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to "reexamine the richness of the biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity."<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" />{{rp|p.66}}

===Reformed and Covenant theology view===
{{Main|Reformed baptismal theology}}

[[Infant Baptism|Paedobaptist]] Covenant theologians see the administration of all the biblical covenants, including the New Covenant, as including a principle of [[family|familial]], corporate inclusion or "generational succession". The biblical covenants between God and man include signs and seals that visibly represent the realities behind the covenants. These visible signs and symbols of God's covenant redemption are administered in a corporate manner (for instance, to households), not in an exclusively individualistic manner.<ref name="WCF28">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Westminster_Confession_of_Faith#CHAPTER_XXVIII._Of_Baptism. |title=Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 28 |publisher=wikisource.org |year=1646 |accessdate=June 12, 2011}}</ref>

Baptism is considered by the Reformed churches as the visible sign of entrance into the New Covenant and therefore may be administered individually to new believers making a public profession of [[faith]]. Paedobaptists further believe this extends corporately to the households of believers which typically would include children, or individually to children or infants of believing parents (see [[Infant baptism]]). In this view, baptism is thus seen as the functional replacement and sacramental equivalent of the Abrahamic rite of [[History of male circumcision#Male circumcision in the Greco-Roman world|circumcision]] and symbolizes the internal cleansing from [[sin]], among other things.

However, if knowledge is absent, "those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church, yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience."<ref>{{cite web|title=LUMEN GENTIUM|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html|work=Vatican II}}</ref>

The Catechism of the Catholic Church also states: "Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more [[exorcism]]s are pronounced over the candidate".<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3J.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1237]</ref> In the [[Roman Rite]] of the baptism of a child, the wording of the prayer of exorcism is: "Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the splendour of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her) free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). Through Christ our Lord."<ref>Rite of Baptism of Children, 86</ref>

Catholics are baptized in water, by submersion, immersion or affusion, in the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit<ref>''Ordo initiationis christanae adultorum'', editio typica, Vatican City, Typis polyglottis vaticanis, 1972, pg 92, cf Lateran IV ''De Fide Catholica'', DS 802, cf Florence, ''Decretum pro Armeniis'', DS, 1317.</ref>—not three gods, but [[Trinity|one God subsisting in three Persons]]. While sharing in the one divine essence, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct, not simply three "masks" or manifestations of one divine being. The faith of the Church and of the individual Christian is based on a relationship with these three "Persons" of the one God. Adults can also be baptized through the [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults]].

It is claimed that [[Pope Stephen I]], [[St. Ambrose]] and [[Pope Nicholas I]] declared that baptisms in the name of "Jesus" only as well as in the name of "Father, Son and Holy Spirit" were valid. The correct interpretation of their words is disputed.<ref name="cathen" /> Current [[canonical law]] requires the Trinitarian formula and water for validity.<ref name="can849" />

The Church recognizes two equivalents of baptism with water: "baptism of blood" and "[[baptism of desire]]". Baptism of blood is that undergone by unbaptized individuals who are [[martyr]]ed for their faith, while baptism of desire generally applies to [[catechumen]]s who die before they can be baptized. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes these two forms:

<blockquote>The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This ''Baptism of blood'', like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament. (1258)</blockquote>

<blockquote>For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament. (1259)</blockquote>

The Catholic Church holds that those who are ignorant of Christ's Gospel and of the Church, but who seek the truth and do God's will as they understand it, may be supposed to have an implicit desire for baptism and can be saved: "'Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.' Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P3M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1260]</ref> As for unbaptized infants, the Church is unsure of their fate; "the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God".<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P3M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1261]</ref>

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that baptism should be performed by complete immersion (submersion) only when an individual is old enough to understand its significance. They believe that water baptism is an outward symbol that a person has made an unconditional dedication through Jesus Christ to do the will of God. They consider baptism to constitute ordination as a minister.<ref>''Jet'' magazine, Aug 4, 1955, page 26 [http://books.google.com/books?id=xbEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=%22jehovah%27s+witnesses%22 Online]</ref>

Prospective candidates for baptism must express their desire to be baptized well in advance of a planned baptismal event, to allow for congregation [[Elder (Christianity)#Jehovah's Witnesses|elders]] to assess their suitability.<ref>''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 182.</ref> Elders approve candidates for baptism if the candidates are considered to understand what is expected of members of the religion and to demonstrate sincere dedication to the faith.<ref>''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 217–218.</ref>

Most baptisms among Jehovah's Witnesses are performed at scheduled assemblies and conventions by elders and ministerial servants<ref>''The Watchtower'', May 15, 1970, page 309.</ref><ref>"The General Priesthood Today", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1963, page 147</ref><ref>''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 215, "Baptisms are usually performed at assemblies and conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses."</ref> and rarely occur at local [[Kingdom Hall]]s.<ref name="autogenerated480">"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, page 480</ref> Prior to baptism, at the conclusion of a pre-baptism talk, candidates must affirm two questions:<ref>Watchtower June 1, 1985</ref>
{{quote|
# On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will?
# Do you understand that your dedication and baptism identify you as one of Jehovah's Witnesses in association with God's spirit-directed organization?}}

Only baptized males may baptize new members. Baptizers and candidates wear swimsuits or other informal clothing for baptism, but are directed to avoid clothing that is considered undignified or revealing.<ref name="autogenerated1999">"“God’s Prophetic Word” District Conventions", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', May 1999, page 4</ref><ref>"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 1973, page 254–255</ref><ref>"Question Box", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', June 1993, page 3</ref> Generally, candidates are individually immersed by a single baptizer,<ref name="autogenerated1999"/> unless a candidate has special circumstances such as a physical [[disability]].<ref name="The Watchtower 1986, page 31">"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', November 15, 1986, page 31</ref> In circumstances of extended isolation, a qualified candidate's dedication and stated intention to become baptized may serve to identify him as a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, even if immersion itself must be delayed.<ref>"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, pages 479–480</ref> In rare instances, unbaptized males who had stated such an intention have reciprocally baptized each other, with both baptisms accepted as valid.<ref>"Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands", ''1987 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', page 71</ref> Individuals who had been baptized in the 1930s and 1940s by female Witnesses, such as in concentration camps, were later re-baptized but recognized their original baptism dates.<ref name="autogenerated480" />

===Latter Day Saints===
[[File:Mormon baptism circa 1850s.png|thumb|right|175px|A Mormon baptism, circa the 1850s]]
{{Main|Baptism (Mormonism)}}

In [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], baptism has the main purpose of remitting the [[sin]]s of the participant. It is followed by [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]], which inducts the person into membership in the church and constitutes a [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]]. Latter-day Saints believe that baptism must be by full immersion, and by a precise ritualized ordinance: if some part of the participant is not fully immersed, or the ordinance was not recited verbatim, the ritual must be repeated.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/priesthood-and-church-government/lesson-5-performing-priesthood-ordinances?lang=eng |title= Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part B |chapter= Performing Priesthood Ordinances, § Baptism |year= 2000 |pages= 41–48 |publisher= LDS Church }}</ref> It typically occurs in a [[baptismal font]].

In addition, Latter-day Saints do not believe a baptism is valid unless it is performed by a Latter-day Saint [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priest]] or [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]].<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/baptism-baptize?lang=eng |title= Study Helps: Guide to the Scriptures |contribution= Baptism, Baptize, § Proper authority |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church }}</ref> Authority is passed down through a form of [[apostolic succession]]. All new converts to the faith must be baptized or [[rebaptism (Mormonism)|re-baptized]]. Baptism is seen as symbolic both of Jesus' death, burial and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/baptism?lang=eng |contribution= Baptism |title= [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|Bible Dictionary]] |work= [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]] |publisher= LDS Church |year= 1979 }}</ref> and is also symbolic of the baptized individual discarding their "natural" self and donning a new identity as a disciple of Jesus.

According to Latter-day Saint theology, [[faith]] and [[repentance]] are prerequisites to baptism. The ritual does not cleanse the participant of [[original sin]], as Latter-day Saints do not believe the doctrine of original sin. Mormonism rejects [[infant baptism]]<ref>[[Book of Mormon]], {{lds|Moroni|moro|8|4|23}}</ref><ref name="EoM Infant Baptism">{{citation |last= Norman |first= Keith E. |contribution= Infant Baptism |url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3795 |pages= 682–683 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H.

Latter-day Saint theology also teaches [[baptism for the dead]] in which deceased ancestors are baptized vicariously by the living, and believe that their practice is what Paul wrote of in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:29}}. This occurs in [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|Latter-day Saint temples]].<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/baptisms-for-the-dead?lang=eng |contribution= Baptisms for the Dead |title= Gospel Topics |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church }}</ref><ref name="EoM Baptism for the dead">{{citation |last= Burton |first= H.

==Non-practitioners==

===Quakers===
[[Quakers]] (members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]]) do not believe in the baptism of either children or adults with water, rejecting all forms of outward [[sacraments]] in their religious life. [[Robert Barclay]]'s ''Apology for the True Christian Divinity'' (a historic explanation of Quaker theology from the 17th century), explains Quakers' opposition to baptism with water thus:

{{Quote|"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire".{{bibleref2c|Mt|3:11}} Here John mentions two manners of baptizings and two different baptisms, the one with water, and the other with the Spirit, the one whereof he was the minister of, the other whereof Christ was the minister of: and such as were baptized with the first were not therefore baptized with the second: "I indeed baptize you, but he shall baptize you." Though in the present time they were baptized with the baptism of water, yet they were not as yet, but were to be, baptized with the baptism of Christ.|[[Robert Barclay]], 1678<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/prop12.html |title=Apology, Proposition 12 |publisher=Qhpress.org |accessdate=July 28, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090617033930/http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/prop12.html| archivedate= June 17, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>}}

[[Robert Barclay|Barclay]] argued that water baptism was only something that happened until the time of Christ, but that now, people are baptised inwardly by the spirit of Christ, and hence there is no need for the external sacrament of water baptism, which [[Quakers]] argue is meaningless.

===Salvation Army===
The [[Salvation Army]] does not practice water baptism, or indeed other outward [[sacraments]]. [[William Booth]] and [[Catherine Booth]], the founders of the [[Salvation Army]], believed that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself. They believed what was important was spiritual grace itself. However, although the [[Salvation Army]] does not practice baptism, they are not opposed to baptism within other Christian denominations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/vw-print/C28E39B2CA06E8F98025708A003D9FAC?openDocument |title=Why does The Salvation Army not baptise or hold communion? |publisher=The Salvation Army |date=February 28, 1987 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>

===Hyperdispensationalism===
<!-- This section is linked from Baptism-->
There are some Christians termed "[[Hyperdispensationalism|Hyperdispensationalists]]" who accept only Paul's Epistles as applicable for the church today. They do not accept baptism or the Lord's Supper, since these are not found in the Prison Epistles.<ref>"Prison epistles" include [[Ephesians]], [[Colossians]], [[Philippians]], and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]]</ref> They also teach that Peter's gospel message was not the same as Paul's.<ref>{{cite web|first=David M. |last=Havard |title=Are We Hyper-Dispensationalists? |url=http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/articles/1011392439.html |publisher=Berean Bible Society |accessdate=January 19, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090204081633/http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/articles/1011392439.html| archivedate= February 04 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Hyperdispensationalists assert:

*The great commission<sup>[{{bibleref2|Matthew|28:18–20}}]</sup> and its baptism is directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later.

*The baptism of {{bibleref2|Acts|2:36–38}} is Peter's call for Israel to repent of complicity in the death of the Messiah; not as a Gospel announcement of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sin, a later doctrine revealed by Paul.

Water baptism found early in the Book of Acts is, according to this view, now supplanted by the one baptism{{Bibleref2c|1cor|12:13||1 Cor 12:13}} foretold by John the Baptist.<ref>{{bibleref2|Luke|3:16}}, {{bibleref2|John|1:33}}, {{bibleref2|Matt|3:11}}{{bibleref2|Acts|1:5}}</ref> The one baptism for today, it is asserted, is the "baptism of the [[Holy Spirit]]".{{bibleref2c|Ac|11:15–16}}

Many in this group also argue that John's promised [[Baptized by fire|baptism by fire]] is pending, referring to the destruction of the world by fire.<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|3:12}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|3:17}}, {{bibleref2|2|Pe|3:10||2 Peter 3:10}}</ref>

John, as he said "baptized with water", as did Jesus's disciples to the early, Jewish Christian church. Jesus himself never personally baptized with water, but did so through his disciples.{{bibleref2c|Jn|4:1–2}} Unlike Jesus' first Apostles, Paul, his Apostle to the Gentiles, was sent to preach rather than to baptize{{bibleref2c|1Cor.|1:17||1 Co 1:17}} but did occasionally baptize, for instance in Corinth{{bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|1:14–16}} and in Philippi,{{bibleref2c|Ac|16:13}} in the same manner as they.<sup>cf.</sup>{{bibleref2c|Mt|28:19}} He also taught the spiritual significance of the submerging in baptism and how one contacts the atoning death of Christ in such.{{bibleref2c|Rom|6:4}}

Other Hyperdispensationalists believe that baptism was necessary only for a short period between Christ's ascension and mid-Acts. The great commission {{bibleref2c|Mt|28:18–20}} and its baptism was directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later. Any Jew who believed did not receive salvation{{bibleref2c|Mk|16:16}} {{bibleref2c|1Peter|3:21||1 Pe 3:21}} or the Holy Spirit{{bibleref2c|Ac|2:38}} until they were baptized. This period ended with the calling of Paul.{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|9:17–18}} Peter's reaction when the Gentiles received the Holy Spirit before baptism{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|10:44–48}} is worthy of note.

| Baptism is considered by the majority of Anabaptist Churches (anabaptist means to baptize again) to be essential to Christian faith but not to salvation. It is considered a biblical ordinance along with communion, feet washing, the holy kiss, the Christian woman's head covering, anointing with oil, and marriage. The Anabaptists also have stood historically against the practice of infant baptism. The Anabaptists stood firmly against infant baptism in a time when the Church and State were one and when people were made a citizen through baptism into the officially sanctioned Church (Reformed or Catholic). Belief and repentance are believed to precede and follow baptism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

| [[Jehovah’s Witnesses]]
| Baptism is necessary for salvation as part of the entire baptismal arrangement: as an expression of obedience to Jesus' command (Matthew 28:19–20), as a public symbol of the saving faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ (Romans 10:10), and as an indication of repentance from dead works and the dedication of one's life to Jehovah. (1 Peter 2:21) However, baptism does not guarantee salvation.<ref>''Worship the Only True God'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses (2002, 2006), "Chapter 12: The Meaning of Your Baptism", p. 118, "It would be a mistake to conclude that baptism is in itself a guarantee of salvation. It has value only if a person has truly dedicated himself to Jehovah through Jesus Christ and thereafter carries out God’s will, being faithful to the end."</ref>
| By submersion only; typical candidates are baptized at district and circuit conventions.<ref>"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1979, p. 31, "The Bible shows that baptism by complete immersion is very important. So even when unusual steps are necessary because of a person’s condition, he should be baptized if at all possible. …In modern times Jehovah’s Witnesses have arranged for baptisms at conventions. [However], fully valid baptisms have even been performed locally in large home bathtubs. …Of course, it might be that in some extreme case baptism would seem absolutely impossible for the time being.

He taught that in baptism a child was cleansed of the guilt of original sin, initiated into the covenant with God, admitted into the church, made an heir of the divine kingdom, and spiritually born anew. He said that while baptism was neither essential to nor sufficient for salvation, it was the "ordinary means" that God designated for applying the benefits of the work of Christ in human lives. On the other hand, although he affirmed the regenerating grace of infant baptism, he also insisted upon the necessity of adult conversion for those who have fallen from grace. A person who matures into moral accountability must respond to God's grace in repentance and faith. Without personal decision and commitment to Christ, the baptismal gift is rendered ineffective. <br> ''Baptism as Forgiveness of Sin''. In baptism God offers and we accept the forgiveness of our sin (Acts 2:38). With the pardoning of sin which has separated us from God, we are justified—freed from the guilt and penalty of sin and restored to right relationship with God. This reconciliation is made possible through the atonement of Christ and made real in our lives by the work of the Holy Spirit. We respond by confessing and repenting of our sin, and affirming our faith that Jesus Christ has accomplished all that is necessary for our salvation. Faith is the necessary condition for justification; in baptism, that faith is professed. God's forgiveness makes possible the renewal of our spiritual lives and our becoming new beings in Christ. <br> ''Baptism as New Life''. Baptism is the sacramental sign of new life through and in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. Variously identified as regeneration, new birth, and being born again, this work of grace makes us into new spiritual creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17). We die to our old nature which was dominated by sin and enter into the very life of Christ who transforms us. Baptism is the means of entry into new life in Christ (John 3:5; Titus 3:5), but new birth may not always coincide with the moment of the administration of water or the laying on of hands. Our awareness and acceptance of our redemption by Christ and new life in him may vary throughout our lives. But, in whatever way the reality of the new birth is experienced, it carries out the promises God made to us in our baptism.|accessdate =August 2, 2007}}</ref><ref name="By Water and the Spirit – Personal Faith">{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=4&mid=992| title = By Water and the Spirit: A United Methodist Understanding of Baptism|publisher = [[The United Methodist Church]]|quote= The United Methodist Church does not accept either the idea that only believer's baptism is valid or the notion that the baptism of infants magically imparts salvation apart from active personal faith.|accessdate =August 2, 2007}}</ref>

==Debaptism==
Most Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be [[sacramental character|neither repeated nor undone]]. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by [[atheism|rejecting religion]] entirely.

In addition to ''de facto'' renunciation through [[apostasy]], [[heresy]], or [[schism (religion)|schism]], the Roman Catholic Church envisaged from 1983 to 2009 the possibility of [[actus formalis defectionis ab Ecclesia catholica|formal defection from the Church]] through a decision manifested personally, consciously and freely, and in writing, to the competent church authority, who was then to judge whether it was genuinely a case of "true separation from the constitutive elements of the life of the Church ... (by) an act of apostasy, heresy or schism."<ref name=PCLT>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/intrptxt/documents/rc_pc_intrptxt_doc_20060313_actus-formalis_en.html Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, ''Actus formalis defectionis ab Ecclesia catholica'']</ref> A formal defection of this kind was then noted in the register of the person's baptism, an annotation that, like those of marriage or ordination, was independent of the fact of the baptism and was not an actual "debaptism", even if the person who formally defected from the Catholic Church had also defected from the Christian religion. The fact of having been baptized remains a fact and the Catholic Church holds that baptism marks a person with a lasting [[sacramental character|seal or character]] that "is an ontological and permanent bond which is not lost by reason of any act or fact of defection."<ref name=PCLT/> Nonetheless, formal requests for debaptisms are made; in France, a man sued the French catholic church for "its refusal to let him nullify his baptism." He had been "un-baptized" in 2000, and ten years later he demanded to have his name stricken from the baptismal records, a request granted by a judge in Normany, a decision appealed by the church.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/01/29/146046428/on-the-record-a-quest-for-de-baptism-in-france|title=Off The Record: A Quest For De-Baptism In France : NPR|last=Beardsley|first=Eleanor|date=January 29, 2012|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}</ref>

Some atheist organizations, such as the [[Italian Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics]] and the British [[National Secular Society]], offer certificates of "debaptism".<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicole Martinelli |url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2007/06/debaptism |title=Debaptism 2.0: Fleeing the Flock Via the Net |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref><ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7941817.stm Atheists call for "debaptism"]</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/mar/20/religion-atheism The peculiar practice of debaptism]</ref><ref>[http://www.skepdic.com/debaptism.html Skeptic's Dictionary definition]</ref> Not even those who provide the certificates consider them as having legal or canonical effect.<ref>"The society's president, Terry Sanderson, says the certificate is not designed to be taken too seriously, and he suggests displaying it in the loo" ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7941817.stm Atheists call for "debaptism").]</ref> The [[Church of England]] refuses to take any action on presentation of the certificate.<ref name=BBC/> The Roman Catholic Church likewise treats it as any other act of renunciation of the Catholic faith, although for a few years, from 2006 to 2009, it did note in the baptismal register any [[formal act of defection from the Catholic Church]], a concept quite distinct from that of presentation of such a certificate.

Using a [[hair dryer]],<ref>[http://www.crosswalk.com/news/religiontoday/11606299/ 'Debaptism' Takes Root with American Atheists]</ref> some atheist groups have conducted tongue-in-cheek "debaptism" ceremonies, not intended to be taken seriously.<ref>"Participants acknowledge the silliness and celebrate freely because the mock ceremony is a very informal [...] While it is true that a ceremony to affirm one’s atheism is unnecessary, it’s also true that human beings are social creatures who simply enjoy being silly from time to time and having fun at celebratory social gatherings". ([http://mnatheists.org/content/view/469/1/ The First Minnesota Atheists Debaptism Event)]</ref>

==Other initiation ceremonies==
{{Main|Initiation}}
Many cultures practice or have practiced initiation rites, with or without the use of water, including the [[ancient Egyptian]], the [[Hebrews|Hebraic]]/Jewish, the [[Babylonia]]n, the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], and the [[Norsemen|Norse]] cultures. The modern Japanese practice of [[Miyamairi]] is such as ceremony that does not use water. In some, such evidence may be [[archaeology|archaeological]] and descriptive in nature, rather than a modern practice.

===Mystery religion initiation rites===
[[Apuleius]], a 2nd-century [[Roman Empire|Roman]] writer, described an initiation into the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] of [[Isis]]. The initiation was preceded by a normal bathing in the public baths and a ceremonial sprinkling by the priest of Isis, after which the candidate was given secret instructions in the temple of the goddess. The candidate then fasted for ten days from meat and wine, after which he was dressed in linen and led at night into the innermost part of the sanctuary, where the actual initiation, the details of which were secret, took place. On the next two days, dressed in the robes of his consecration, he participated in feasting.<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[Apuleius]] |others=trans. E. J. Kenney |chapter=11.23|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=EF44Zv5yFUcC&pg=PA208 |title=The golden ass or Metamorphoses|publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=New York City |year=1998 |pages=208–210 |isbn=0-14-043590-5 |oclc=41174027}}</ref> Apuleius describes also an initiation into the cult of [[Osiris]] and yet a third initiation, of the same pattern as the initiation into the cult of Isis, without mention of a preliminary bathing.<ref>Apuleius, ''The Golden Ass'' (Penguin Books), pp. 211-214</ref>

The water-less initiations of Lucius, the character in Apuleius's story who had been turned into an ass and changed back by Isis into human form, into the successive degrees of the rites of the goddess was accomplished only after a significant period of study to demonstrate his loyalty and trustworthiness, akin to [[catechumen]]al practices preceding baptism in Christianity.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Lars |last=Hartman |title=Into the Name of the Lord Jesus: Baptism in the Early Church |publisher=[[T&T Clark]]|location=[[Edinburgh]] |year=1997 |page=4 |isbn=0-567-08589-9 |oclc=38189287}}</ref>

===Gnostic Catholicism and Thelema===

===Baptism of objects===
[[File:USS Dewey christening.jpg|200 px|right|Christening of [[USS Dewey]]]]

The word "baptism" or "christening" is sometimes used to describe the inauguration of certain objects for use.

*The name ''Baptism of Bells'' has been given to the blessing of ([[bell (instrument)|musical]], especially [[Church bell|church]]) bells, at least in France, since the 11th century. It is derived from the washing of the bell with [[holy water]] by the bishop, before he anoints it with the oil of the infirm without and with chrism within; a fuming [[censer]] is placed under it and the bishop prays that these [[sacramentals]] of the Church may, at the sound of the bell, put the demons to flight, protect from storms, and call the faithful to prayer.
*''Baptism of Ships'': at least since the time of the [[Crusades]], rituals have contained a blessing for ships. The priest begs God to bless the vessel and protect those who sail in. The ship is usually sprinkled with [[holy water]].<ref name="cathen" />

==Mandaean baptism==
[[Mandaeanism|Mandaeans]] revere [[John the Baptist]] and practice frequent baptism as a ritual of purification, not of initiation.<ref>[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/030609/9mandeans_2.htm US News]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=bBccilWD5n0C&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=mandeans+baptism&source=bl&ots=HSVSYyUnpM&sig=FzJC0YuVZOAJwzFwiDCYvr6Owt8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=w2zOULzhHI2u8ATc3oBw&ved=0CHIQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&q=mandeans%20baptism&f=false]</ref><ref>[http://www.mandaeanunion.org/History/EN_History_007.htm]</ref>
