'''Cuauhtémoc''' ({{IPA-nah|kʷaːʍˈtemoːk}}, {{Audio-IPA|Cuahutemoc.ogg|kwauˈtemok}} also known as '''Cuauhtemotzin''', '''Guatimozin''' or '''Guatemoc'''; c. 1495) was the [[Aztec]] ruler (''[[tlatoani]]'') of [[Tenochtitlan]] from 1520 to 1521.  The name Cuāuhtemōc means "One That Has Descended Like an Eagle", commonly rendered in English as "Descending Eagle" as in the moment when an eagle folds its wings and plummets down to strike its prey, so this is a name that implies aggressiveness and determination.

Cuauhtémoc took power in 1520 as successor of [[Cuitláhuac]] and was a cousin of the former emperor [[Moctezuma II]]. His young wife, who would later be known as [[Isabel Moctezuma]], was one of Moctezuma's daughters.  He ascended to the throne when he was 25 years of age, as his city was being besieged by the [[Spain|Spanish]] and devastated by an epidemic of [[smallpox]] brought to the New World by Spanish invaders. Probably after the [[The Massacre in the Main Temple, Tenochtitlán|killings in the main temple]], there were few Aztec captains available to take the position.

==Capture and Torture==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2006}}

Cuauhtémoc called for reinforcements from the countryside to aid the defense of Tenochtitlán, after eighty days of warfare against the Spanish.  Of all the Nahuas, only Tlatelolcas remained loyal, and the surviving Tenochcas looked for refuge in [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], where even women took part in the battle.  Cuauhtémoc was captured on August 13, 1521, while fleeing [[Tenochtitlán]] by crossing [[Lake Texcoco]] in disguise with his wife, family, and friends.  He surrendered to [[Hernán Cortés]] along with the surviving ''[[pipiltin]]'' (nobles) and, according to Spanish sources, he offered Cortés his knife and asked to be killed.

According to the same Spanish accounts, Cortés refused this offer and treated his foe magnanimously.  "You have defended your capital like a brave warrior," he declared, "A Spaniard knows how to respect valor, even in an enemy."<ref>William H. Prescott, ''History of the Conquest of Mexico'' (New York, 1843), vol. 3, p. 206.</ref>  At Cuauhtémoc's request, Cortés also allowed the defeated Mexica to depart the city unmolested. Subsequently, however, when the booty found did not measure up to the Spaniards' expectations,<ref>Prescott, vol. 3, p. 211.</ref> Cuauhtémoc was tortured in an unsuccessful attempt to discover its whereabouts.<ref>Prescott, vol. 3, pp. 234-235.</ref>  Eventually some gold was recovered, though far less than Cortés and his men expected.

==Execution==
[[File:CuauhtemocLastMsgDF.JPG|thumb|Mosaic of what is considered to be Cuauhtemoc's last address as tlatoani in Nahuatl and Spanish]]
In 1525, Cortés took Cuauhtémoc and several other indigenous nobles on his expedition to [[Honduras]], fearing that Cuauhtémoc could have led an insurrection in his absence.<ref name = "otbjad">Restall (2004, p.148).</ref> While the expedition was stopped in the [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal Maya]] capital of [[Itzamkanac]], known as [[Acalan]] in [[Nahuatl]], Cortés had Cuauhtémoc [[execution|executed]] for allegedly conspiring to kill him and the other Spaniards.

[[File:MonumentCuitlahuacPaseo2.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Cuauhtémoc on [[Paseo de la Reforma|Avenida Reforma]] in [[Mexico City]]. The inscription at the bottom of the statue translates as "In memory of Cuauhtémoc (spelled Quautemoc) and his warriors who battled heroically in defense of their country."]]
There are a number of discrepancies in the various accounts of the event. According to Cortés himself, on 27 February 1525 it was revealed to him by a citizen of [[Tenochtitlan]] named Mexicalcingo that Cuauhtémoc, [[Coanacoch]] (the ruler of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]) and [[Tetlepanquetzal]] (the ruler of [[Tlacopan]]) were plotting his death. Cortés interrogated them until each confessed, and then had Cuauhtémoc, Tetlepanquetzal, and another lord named [[Tlacatlec]] hanged. Cortés wrote that the other lords would be too frightened to plot against him again, as they believed he had uncovered the plan through magic powers. Cortés's account is supported by the historian [[Francisco López de Gómara]].<ref>Restall (2004, pp.149–150).</ref>

According to [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], a [[conquistador]] serving under Cortés who recorded his experiences in his book ''[[The Conquest of New Spain]]'', the supposed plot was revealed by two men, named Tapia and Juan Velásquez. Díaz portrays the executions as unjust and based on no evidence, and admits to having liked Cuauhtémoc personally. He also records Cuauhtémoc giving the following speech to Cortés, through his [[interpreting|interpreter]] [[Malinche]]:
{{quote|Oh Malinzin [i.e., Cortés]! Now I understand your false promises and the kind of death you have had in store for me. For you are killing me unjustly. May God demand justice from you, as it was taken from me when I entrusted myself to you in my city of Mexico!}}
Díaz wrote that afterwards, Cortés suffered from [[insomnia]] due to [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and badly injured himself while wandering at night.<ref>Restall (2004, pp.150,152).</ref>

[[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl]], a [[Mestizo]] historian and descendant of Coanacoch, wrote an account of the executions in the 17th century partly based on Texcocan [[oral tradition]].<ref name = "otbjad"/> According to Ixtlilxóchitl the three lords were joking cheerfully with each other, due to a rumor that Cortés had decided to return the expedition to Mexico, when Cortés asked a spy to tell him what they were talking about. The spy reported honestly, but Cortés invented the plot himself. Cuauhtémoc, Coanacoch and Tetlepanquetzal were all hanged, as well as eight others. However, Cortés cut down Coanacoch, the last to be hanged, after his brother began rallying his warriors. Coanacoch did not have long to enjoy his reprieve—Ixtlilxóchitl wrote that he died a few days later.<ref>Restall (2004, p.152).</ref>

[[Tlacotzin]], Cuauhtémoc's ''[[cihuacoatl (position)|cihuacoatl]]'', was appointed his successor as ''tlatoani''. He died the next year before returning to Tenochtitlan.

The modern-day town of [[Ixcateopan]] in the [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Guerrero]] is home to an [[ossuary]] purportedly containing Cuauhtémoc's remains.

Many places in Mexico are named in honour of Cuauhtémoc. These include [[Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua|Ciudad Cuauhtémoc]] in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and the [[Cuauhtémoc, D.F.|Cuauhtémoc]] borough of the [[Mexican Federal District]], as well as Ciudad Cuauhtémoc, in the state of Veracruz. There is also a [[Metro Cuauhtémoc|Cuauhtémoc station]] on the [[Mexico City metro]] and the Monterrey [[Metrorrey]].

Cuauhtémoc is also one of the few non-Spanish [[given name]]s for Mexican boys that is perennially popular.
[[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]] Solórzano, a prominent Mexican politician, is named after him. In the Aztec campaign of the [[Personal computer game|PC game]] ''[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors]]'', the player plays as Cuauhtémoc, despite the name ''[[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]]'' for the campaign itself, and Cuauhtémoc narrates the openings and closings to each scenario. In the next installment to the series, ''[[Age of Empires 3: The War Chiefs]]'', Cuauhtémoc was the leader of Aztecs. The [[Mexico|Mexican]] football player [[Cuauhtémoc Blanco]] was also named after him.

In the 1996 [[Rage Against The Machine]] single ''[[People of the Sun]]'', lyricist [[Zack De La Rocha]] rhymes "When the fifth sun sets get back reclaimed, The spirit of Cuauhtémoc alive an untamed".

Cuauhtémoc, in the name Guatemoc, is portrayed sympathetically in the adventure novel ''[[Montezuma's Daughter]]'', by [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]]. First appearing in Chapter XIV, he becomes friends with the protagonist after they save each other's lives. His coronation, torture, and death are described in the novel.
