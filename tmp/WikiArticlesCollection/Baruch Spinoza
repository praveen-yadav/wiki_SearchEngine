Spinoza's given name in different languages is {{lang-he|ברוך שפינוזה}} ''Baruch Spinoza'', {{lang-pt|Benedito or Bento de Espinosa}} and {{lang-la|Benedictus de Spinoza}}; in all these languages, the given name means "the Blessed". Spinoza was raised in the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine. The [[Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)|Jewish religious authorities]] issued a ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (Hebrew: חרם, a kind of ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion, or [[excommunication]]) against him, effectively excluding him from Jewish society at age 23. His books were also later put on the Catholic Church's ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]''.

Spinoza lived an outwardly simple life as a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] grinder, turning down rewards and honors throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions. The family inheritance he gave to his sister. His philosophical accomplishments and moral character prompted 20th-century philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] to name him "the 'prince' of philosophers" (meaning the "first" of "modern materialist" philosophers).<ref>quoted in the translator's preface of Deleuze ''Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza'' (1990).</ref>

Spinoza died at the age of 44 allegedly of a lung illness, perhaps [[tuberculosis]] or [[silicosis]] exacerbated by fine glass dust inhaled while grinding optical lenses. Spinoza is buried in the churchyard of the Christian [[Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in [[The Hague]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Speculum Spinozanum, 1677-1977 |first1=Benedictus |last1=de Spinoza |first2=Siegfried |last2=Hessing |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul |year=1977 |page=828

==Biography==

===Family and community origins===
Spinoza's ancestors were of [[Sephardic Jew]]ish descent, and were a part of the community of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Portuguese Jews]] that grew in the city of [[Amsterdam]] after the [[Alhambra Decree]] in Spain (1492) and the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536) had led to [[Conversos|forced conversions]] and expulsions from the [[Iberian peninsula]].<ref>Magnusson 1990.</ref>

Attracted by the Decree of Toleration issued in 1579 by the [[Union of Utrecht]], Portuguese "[[converso]]s" first sailed to Amsterdam in 1593 and promptly reconverted to Judaism.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.15.</ref> In 1598 permission was granted to build a synagogue, and in 1615 an ordinance for the admission and government of the Jews was passed.<ref name="ReferenceB">Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.19.</ref> As a community of exiles, the Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam were highly proud of their identity.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The Spinoza family ("Espinosa" in Portuguese) probably had its origins in [[Espinosa de los Monteros]], near [[Burgos]], Spain.  The family was expelled from Spain in 1492 and fled to Portugal.  However, in Portugal they were nevertheless forcibly converted to Catholicism in 1498.<ref>Javier Muguerza in his ''Desde la perplejidad''</ref><ref>Ben-Menahem, Ari, ''Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1'' (Springer, 2009), p. 1095.</ref>

Spinoza's father was born roughly a century after this forced conversion in the small Portuguese city of [[Vidigueira]], near [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]] in [[Alentejo]]. When Spinoza's father was still a child, Spinoza's grandfather, Isaac de Spinoza (who was from [[Lisbon]]), took his family to [[Nantes]] in France. They were expelled in 1615 and moved to [[Rotterdam]], where Isaac died in 1627.

Spinoza's father, Miguel (Michael), and his uncle, Manuel, then moved to Amsterdam where they resumed practicing Judaism. Miguel was a successful merchant and became a warden of the synagogue and of the Amsterdam Jewish school.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> He buried three wives, however, and three of his six children died before reaching adulthood.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.20. (Scruton states that only Baruch and Rebekah reached adulthood, but Baruch's younger brother Gabriel apparently did as well.)</ref>

===17th century Holland===
Amsterdam and Rotterdam operated as important [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] centers where merchant ships from many parts of the world brought people of various customs and beliefs. This hustle and bustle ensured, as in the Mediterranean region during the Renaissance, some possibility of free thought and shelter from the crushing hand of ecclesiastical authority. Not by chance both the philosophies of 
Descartes and Spinoza were developed in very close chronological proximity within the physical and intellectual boundaries of the Dutch Republic in the 17th century.<ref>Israel, J. (1998), The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477-1806, Oxford, Oxford University Press, p. 4, p. 583, p. 677, p. 917.</ref> Spinoza may have had access to a circle of friends who were unconventional in terms of social tradition, including members of the [[Collegiants]].<ref>De Dijn, Herman, ''Spinoza: The Way to Wisdom'' (Purdue University Press, 1996), pp. 3 & 4.</ref> One of the people he knew was [[Niels Stensen]], a brilliant Danish student in Leiden;<ref>Nadler, Steven, ''Spinoza: A Life'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 195.</ref> others included [[Albert Burgh]], with whom Spinoza is known to have corresponded.<ref>Curley, Edwin, "Spinoza's exchange with Albert Burgh", in Melamed & Rosenthal (eds.), ''Spinoza's'' Theological-Political Treatise'': A Critical Guide'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 11–28.</ref>

Baruch de Espinoza was born on 24 November 1632 in the [[Jodenbuurt (Amsterdam)|Jodenbuurt]] in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He was the second son of Miguel de Espinoza, a successful, although not wealthy, Portuguese [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jewish]] merchant in Amsterdam.<ref>See Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1.</ref> His mother, Ana Débora, Miguel's second wife, died when Baruch was only six years old.<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.23 (his mother's death when he was six years old).</ref> Spinoza's mother tongue was Portuguese, although he also knew Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch, perhaps French, and later Latin.<ref name="ReferenceC">S. Nadler, Spinoza: A Life, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 47</ref> Although he wrote in Latin, Spinoza learned Latin late in his youth.

Spinoza had a traditional Jewish upbringing, attending the Keter Torah [[yeshiva]] of the Amsterdam Talmud Torah congregation headed by the learned and traditional senior Rabbi [[Saul Levi Morteira]]. His teachers also included the less traditional Rabbi [[Manasseh ben Israel]], "a man of wide learning and secular interests, a friend of [[Gerardus Vossius|Vossius]], [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]], and [[Rembrandt]]".<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.8.</ref>  While presumably a star pupil, and perhaps considered as a potential rabbi, Spinoza never reached the advanced study of the Torah in the upper levels of the curriculum.<ref name="See Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1">See Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1</ref> Instead, at the age of 17, after the death of his elder brother, Isaac, he cut short his formal studies in order to begin working in the family importing business.<ref name="See Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1"/>

In 1653, at age 20, Spinoza began studying Latin with Frances van den Enden ([[Franciscus van den Enden]]), a notorious free thinker, former Jesuit, and radical democrat who likely introduced Spinoza to scholastic and [[modern philosophy]], including that of Descartes.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, pp.20-21; Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.27, n.27, p.189.</ref> (A decade later, in the early 1660s, Van den Enden was considered to be a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] and [[atheist]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/fvde/Bio3.htm |title= Franciscus van den Enden/Biography |author=Frank Mertens, Ghent University |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref> and his books were put on the Catholic Index of banned books.)

Spinoza's father, Miguel, died in 1654 when Spinoza was 21. He duly recited [[Kaddish]], the Jewish prayer of mourning, for eleven months as required by Jewish law.<ref name="Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1">Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1.</ref> When his sister Rebekah disputed his inheritance, he took her to court to establish his claim, won his case, but then renounced his claim in her favor.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.21.</ref>

Spinoza adopted the Latin name Benedictus de Spinoza,<ref>{{cite book| author=Strathern, Paul| title = Spinoza in 90 Minutes| date = 25 September 1998| publisher=Ivan R. Dee| isbn = 978-1-56663-215-7| pages = 24–25 }}</ref> began boarding with Van den Enden, and began teaching in his school.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.21; Nadler 2001 ch.2 p.27, n.27, p.189.</ref> He is said to have fallen in love with his teacher's daughter, Clara, but she rejected him for a richer student (although this story has also been discounted on the basis that Clara Maria van den Enden was born in 1643 and would have been no more than about 18 years old at the time Spinoza left Amsterdam.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> In 1671 she married [[Theodor Kerckring|Dirck Kerckring]].)

During this period Spinoza also became acquainted with the [[Collegiants]], an anti-clerical [[sect]] of Remonstrants with tendencies towards [[rationalism]], and with the Mennonites who had existed for a century but were close to the Remonstrants.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.20.</ref> Many of his friends belonged to dissident Christian groups which met regularly as discussion groups and which typically rejected the authority of established churches as well as traditional dogmas.<ref name=tws908>{{cite news | author=Anthony Gottlieb | title = God Exists, Philosophically (review of "Spinoza: A Life" by Steven Nadler) | publisher=The New York Times, Books. 18 July 1999 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/18/reviews/990718.18gottlit.html | accessdate =7 September 2009}}</ref>

It should be noted, though, Spinoza's break with the prevailing dogmas of Judaism, and particularly the insistence on non-Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, was not sudden; rather, it appears to have been the result of a lengthy internal struggle:  "If anyone thinks my criticism [regarding the authorship of the Bible] is of too sweeping a nature and lacking sufficient foundation, I would ask him to undertake to show us in these narratives a definite plan such as might legitimately be imitated by historians in their chronicles... If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty Apollo.  For I confess that all my efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery.  Indeed, I may add that I write nothing here that is not the fruit of lengthy reflection; and although I have been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture, I have felt bound in the end to embrace the views I here express."<ref name=":0">Benedictus de Spinoza, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus: Gebhardt Edition (E.J. Brill 1989), p. 179 (available at http://books.google.com/books?id=y3Cd7Yd73esC&pg=PA186&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false).</ref>

Nevertheless, once branded as a heretic, Spinoza's clashes with authorities became more pronounced.  For example, questioned by two members of his synagogue, Spinoza apparently responded that God has a body and nothing in scripture says otherwise.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.21.</ref> He was later attacked on the steps of the synagogue by a knife-wielding assailant shouting "Heretic!" He was apparently quite shaken by this attack and for years kept (and wore) his torn cloak, unmended, as a souvenir.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.21.</ref>

After his father's death in 1654, Spinoza ran the family importing business along with his younger brother Gabriel (Abraham).<ref name="Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1"/> The business ran into serious financial difficulties, however, perhaps as a result of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]]. In March 1656, Spinoza filed suit with the Amsterdam municipal authorities to be declared an orphan in order to escape his father's business debts, so that he could inherit his mother's estate (which his father had inherited in trust for him) without it being subject to his father's creditors.<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.25.</ref> In addition, after having made substantial contributions to the Talmud Torah synagogue in 1654 and 1655, he reduced his December 1655 contribution and his March 1656 pledge to nominal amounts (and the March 1656 pledge was never paid).<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, pp.26-27.</ref>

Spinoza was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his younger brother, Gabriel, and devote himself to philosophy and optics.

===Expulsion from the Jewish religious community===
On 27 July 1656, the Talmud Torah congregation of Amsterdam issued a writ of ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (Hebrew: חרם, a kind of ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion, or [[excommunication]]) against the 23 year old Spinoza.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.21.</ref> The following document translates the official record of the censure:<ref name="ts66">Steven Nadler, Spinoza: A Life, Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (23 April 2001), ISBN 978-0-521-00293-6, Page: 120</ref>
<blockquote>
The Lords of the ma'amad, having long known of the evil opinions and acts of Baruch de Espinoza, have endeavord by various means and promises, to turn him from his evil ways. But having failed to make him mend his wicked ways, and, on the contrary, daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies which he practiced and taught and about his monstrous deeds, and having for this numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and born witness to this effect in the presence of the said Espinoza, they became convinced of the truth of the matter; and after all of this has been investigated in the presence of the honorable chachamin, they have decided, with their consent, that the said Espinoza should be excommunicated and expelled from the people of Israel. By the decree of the angels, and by the command of the holy men, we excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Baruch de Espinoza, with the consent of God, Blessed be He, and with the consent of all the Holy Congregation, in front of these holy Scrolls with the [[613 commandments|six-hundred-and-thirteen precepts]] which are written therein, with the excommunication with which Joshua banned Jericho, with the curse with which Elisha cursed the boys, and with all the curses which are written in the Book of the Law. Cursed be he by day and cursed be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up; cursed be he when he goes out, and cursed be he when he comes in. The Lord will not spare him; the anger and wrath of the Lord will rage against this man, and bring upon him all the curses which are written in this book, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven, and the Lord will separate him to his injury from all the tribes of Israel with all the curses of the covenant, which are written in the Book of the Law. But you who cleave unto the Lord God are all alive this day. We order that no one should communicate with him orally or in writing, or show him any favor, or stay with him under the same roof, or within four [[ell]]s of him, or read anything composed or written by him.</blockquote>

The Talmud Torah congregation issued censure routinely, on matters great and small, so such an edict was not unusual<ref>Yitzhak Melamed, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University, speaking at an Artistic Director's Roundtable, Theater J, Washington D.C., 18 March 2012. See also Nadler 2001, ch. 1, p.7.</ref>
[[File:Espinoza estatua.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Statue of Spinoza, near his house on the Paviljoensgracht in [[The Hague]].]]
The language of Spinoza's censure is unusually harsh, however, and does not appear in any other censure known to have been issued by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.2.</ref> The exact reason for expelling Spinoza is not stated.<ref>Steven B. Smith, ''Spinoza's book of life: freedom and redemption in the Ethics'', Yale University Press (1 December 2003), p.xx/Introduction [http://books.google.com/books?id=j0dMphwIwQ8C&pg=PT19&lpg=PT19&dq=cherem+-+spinoza+-+unknown&source=bl&ots=OPBy3G58Jj&sig=B4K5gEHFfPBwKtnK0kPxfqeE2mY&hl=en&ei=LlJITLe9FMT7lweKpMWbCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=cherem%20-%20spinoza%20-%20unknown&f=false google books]</ref> The censure refers only to the "abominable heresies that he practiced and taught," to his "monstrous deeds," and to the testimony of witnesses "in the presence of the said Espinoza." There is no record of such testimony, but there appear to have been several likely reasons for the issuance of the censure.

First, there were Spinoza's radical theological views that he was apparently expressing in public. As philosopher and Spinoza biographer Steven Nadler puts it: "No doubt he was giving utterance to just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical treatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential God—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law was neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can there be any mystery as to why one of history's boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?"<ref>Steven Nadler, Baruch Spinoza, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, First published Fri 29 June 2001; substantive revision Mon 1 December 2008, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#Bio plato.standord.eu]</ref>

Second, there is ample basis to assume that the Amsterdam Jewish community, largely comprising former "conversos" having within the last century fled from the Portuguese Inquisition (and their children and grandchildren), must have been concerned to protect its reputation from any association with Spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for their own possible persecution or expulsion.<ref>Nadler 2001, ch. 2, pp. 17–22.</ref> There is little or no evidence that the Amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved in Spinoza's censure itself. But "in 1619, the town council expressly ordered [the Portuguese Jewish community] to regulate their conduct and ensure that the members of the community kept to a strict observance of Jewish law";<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.19.</ref> and other evidence, such as bans adopted by the synagogue itself on public wedding or funeral processions and on discussing religious matters with Christians, lest such activity might "disturb the liberty we enjoy,"<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.20.</ref> makes it clear that the danger of upsetting the civil authorities was never far from mind. Thus, the issuance of Spinoza's censure was almost certainly, in part, an exercise in self-censorship by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.<ref>See Nadler 2001, ch.2, pp.19-21.</ref>

Third, it appears likely that Spinoza himself had already taken the initiative to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later, in his ''Theological-Political Treatise'', that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves. Either for financial or other reasons,<ref>See Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.28, n.28, p.189.</ref> he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656. And he had committed the "monstrous deed," contrary the regulations of the synagogue and the views of certain rabbinical authorities (including Maimonides), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, pp.25-25.</ref>—to renounce his father's heritage, no less. Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he is reported to have said: "Very well; this does not force me to do anything that I would not have done of my own accord, had I not been afraid of a scandal."<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.22.</ref> Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn.

After the censure, Spinoza is said to have addressed an "Apology" (defense), written in Spanish, to the elders of the synagogue, "in which he defended his views as orthodox, and condemned the rabbis for accusing him of 'horrible practices and other enormities' merely because he had neglected ceremonial observances."<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.22.</ref> This "Apology" does not survive, but some of its contents may later have been included in his ''Theological-Political Treatise''.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.22.</ref> For example, he cited a series of cryptic statements by medieval biblical commentator [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] intimating that certain apparently anachronistic passages of the Pentateuch (i.e., "[t]he Canaanite was then in the land," Genesis 12:6, which Ibn Ezra called a "mystery" and exhorted those "who understand[] it keep silent") were not of [[Mosaic authorship]] as proof that his own views had valid historical precedent.<ref name=":0" />

The most remarkable aspect of the censure may be not so much its issuance, or even Spinoza's refusal to submit, but the fact that Spinoza's expulsion from the Jewish community did not lead to his conversion to Christianity.<ref name="Yitzhak Melamed 2012">Yitzhak Melamed, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University, speaking at an Artistic Director's Roundtable, Theater J, Washington D.C., 18 March 2012.</ref> Spinoza kept the Latin (and so implicitly Christian) name Benedict de Spinoza, maintained a close association with the Collegiants, a Christian sect, even moved to a town near the Collegiants' headquarters, and was buried in a Christian graveyard—but there is no evidence or suggestion that he ever accepted baptism or participated in a Christian mass. Thus, by default, Baruch de Espinoza became the first secular Jew of modern Europe.<ref name="Yitzhak Melamed 2012"/>

The philosopher Richard Popkin questions the historical veracity of the censure, which Popkin claims emerged close to 300 years after Spinoza's death.<ref name=tws9990/>{{Why?|date=August 2011}}

Spinoza spent his remaining 21 years writing and studying as a private scholar.<ref name=tws908/>

After the cherem, the Amsterdam municipal authorities, "responding to the appeals of the rabbis, and also of the Calvinist clergy, who had been vicariously offended by the existence of a free thinker in the synagogue,"<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.22.</ref> promptly expelled Spinoza from Amsterdam. He spent a brief time in or near the village of [[Ouderkerk aan de Amstel]], but returned soon afterwards to Amsterdam and lived there quietly for several years, giving private philosophy lessons and grinding lenses, before leaving the city in 1660 or 1661.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.22.</ref>

During this time in Amsterdam, Spinoza wrote his ''Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being'', "of which two Dutch translations survive, discovered about 1810."<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.22.</ref>

Spinoza moved around 1660 or 1661 from Amsterdam to [[Rijnsburg]], (near [[Leiden]]), the headquarters of the Collegiants.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.23.</ref> In Rijnsburg he began work on his ''Descartes' "Principles of Philosophy"'' as well as on his masterpiece, the ''Ethics''. In 1663 he returned briefly to Amsterdam, where he finished and published ''Descartes's "Principles of Philosophy"'' (the only work published in his lifetime under his own name), and then moved the same year to [[Voorburg]].<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.24.</ref>

===Voorburg===
In Voorburg, Spinoza continued work on the ''Ethics'' and corresponded with scientists, philosophers, and theologians across Europe.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.25.</ref> He also wrote and in 1670 published his ''Theological Political Treatise'' in defense of secular and constitutional government—and in support of [[Jan de Witt]], the Grand Pensionary of the Netherlands, against the Stadholder, the Prince of Orange.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.25-26.</ref> [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who visited Spinoza, claimed that Spinoza's life was in danger when supporters of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]] murdered [[Johan de Witt|de Witt]] in 1672.<ref>"…he [Spinoza] told me [Leibniz] he had a strong desire, on the day of the massacre of Mess. [[Johan de Witt|De Witt]], to sally forth at night, and put up somewhere, near the place of the massacre, a paper with the words ''Ultimi barbarorum'' [ultimate barbarity]. But his host had shut the house to prevent his going out, for he would have run the risk of being torn to pieces."  (''A Refutation Recently Discovered of Spinoza by Leibnitz'', "Remarks on the Unpublished Refutation of Spinoza by Leibnitz," Edinburg: Thomas Constable and Company, 1855. Page 70. Available on [http://books.google.com/books?id=cCYCAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=refutation+recently+discovered&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AwLaT5aoN4OI6AHe6NnLAg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=refutation%20recently%20discovered&f=false Google Books]</ref> While published anonymously, the work did not long remain so, and de Witt's enemies characterized it as "forged in Hell by a renegade Jew and the Devil, and issued with the knowledge of Jan de Witt."<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.26.</ref> It was condemned in 1673 by the Synod of the Reformed Church and formally banned in 1674.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.26.</ref>

===Lens grinding and optics===
Spinoza earned a modest living from lens-grinding and instrument making, yet while living in Voorburg through correspondence and friendships with scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] and mathematician [[Johannes Hudde]] he was involved in important optical investigations of the day including debate over microscope design with Huygens, favoring small objectives<ref>Christiaan Huygens, Oeuvres completes, Letter No. 1638, 11 Maj 1668</ref> and collaborating on calculations for a prospective 40&nbsp;ft telescope which would have been one of the largest in Europe at the time<ref>Christiaan Huygens, Oeuvres completes, letter to his brother 23 September 1667</ref> The quality of Spinoza's lenses was much praised by Christiaan Huygens among others<ref>Stephen Nadler, Spinoza: A Life (2001) p.183</ref> in fact his technique and instruments were so esteemed [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.|Constantijn Huygens]] in 1687 ground a "clear and bright" 42&nbsp;ft. telescope lens from one of Spinoza's grinding dishes 10 years after his death<ref>Christiaan Huygens, Oeuvres completes vol. XXII, p. 732, footnote</ref> The exact type of lenses Spinoza made are not known, but very likely included lenses for both the microscope and telescope. He was said by anatomist [[Theodor Kerckring]] to have produced an "excellent" microscope, the quality of which was the foundation of Kerckring's anatomy claims.<ref>Theodore Kerckring, "Spicilegium Anatomicum" Observatio XCIII (1670)</ref> During his time as a lens and instrument maker he was also supported by small, but regular, donations from close friends.<ref name=tws908/>

===The Hague===
In 1670 Spinoza moved to [[The Hague]], where he lived on a small pension from Jan de Witt and a small annuity from the brother of his dead friend, Simon de Vries.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.26.</ref> He worked on the ''Ethics'', wrote an unfinished Hebrew grammar, began his ''Political Treatise'', wrote two scientific essays ("On the Rainbow" and "On the Calculation of Chances"), and began a Dutch translation (that he later destroyed) of the Bible.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.26.</ref>

Spinoza chose the Latin word "caute" (be cautious), inscribed beneath a rose, itself a symbol of secrecy, as his device.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> "For, having chosen to write in a language that was so widely intelligible, he was compelled to hide what he had written."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 1676, Spinoza met with Leibniz at The Hague for a discussion of his principal philosophical work, ''[[Ethics (book)|Ethics]]'', which had been completed in 1676. This meeting was described in Matthew Stewart's ''The Courtier and the Heretic''.<ref name="Lucas1960">Lucas, 1960.</ref>

Spinoza's health began to fail in 1676, and he died on 20 February 1677, at the age of 44.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.29.</ref> His premature death was said to be due to lung illness, possibly [[silicosis]] as a result of breathing in glass dust from the lenses he ground. Later, a shrine was made of his home in The Hague.<ref name=tws9907>{{cite news

When the public reactions to the anonymously published ''Theologico-Political Treatise'' were extremely unfavourable to his brand of Cartesianism, Spinoza was compelled to abstain from publishing more of his works. Wary and independent, he wore a [[signet ring]] which he used to mark his letters and which was engraved with a rose and the word [http://photobucket.com/images/spinoza,+rose,+caute/ "caute"] (Latin for "cautiously").<ref>Stewart, Matthew, ''The Courtier and the Heretic'' (W.

===Substance, attributes and modes===
{{Main|Philosophy of Spinoza}}
{{quotation|These are the fundamental concepts with which Spinoza sets forth a vision of Being, illuminated by his awareness of God. They may seem strange at first sight. To the question "What is?" he replies: "Substance, its attributes, and modes".|[[Karl Jaspers]]<ref>''Spinoza'', Karl Jaspers p.9</ref>}}

Spinoza argued that God exists and is abstract and impersonal.<ref name=tws908/> Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical [[thought]], offering powerful weapons for prevailing against "received authority." As a youth he first subscribed to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] belief that body and mind are two separate substances, but later changed his view and asserted that they were not separate, being a single entity. He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality which surrounds us and of which we are part. Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality,<ref name=tws9912/> namely a single, fundamental [[Substance theory|substance]] (meaning "that which stands beneath" rather than "matter") that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser "entities" are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause and effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published ''Ethics.''<ref name=tws908/> Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind-body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then it is not clear how they can coordinate in any manner. That humans presume themselves to have [[free will]], he argues, is a result of their awareness of appetites which affect their minds while being unable to understand the reasons why they want and act as they do. Spinoza has been described by one writer as an "Epicurean materialist,"<ref name=tws9912/> although to call Spinoza a materialist (as the Epicureans were) would be misleading as he treats both thought (the realm of the mind and thought) and extension (physical reality) as derivatives of an ultimate, infinite substance (''Deus sive Natura, ''or God) which expresses infinite attributes and modes. To use an example, human experience is but a single drop of water in an infinite ocean which constitutes existence.

Spinoza contends that "''[[Deus]] sive Natura''" ("God or Nature") is a being of infinitely many attributes, of which thought and extension are two. His account of the nature of reality, then, seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined, causally related, and deriving from the same substance. It is important to note here that, in Parts 3 through 4 of the ''Ethics'', Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors.  He directly contests dualism.  The universal substance emanates both body and mind; while they are different modes, there is no fundamental difference between these aspects. This formulation is a historically significant solution to the [[mind-body problem]] known as [[neutral monism]]. Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by Providence in which God can make changes, but a God which itself is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part. While it could be said that this still accounts for Divine Providence, as Spinoza argues that "things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case,"<ref>Baruch Spinoza.  ''Ethics'', in'' Spinoza: Complete Works'', trans. by Samuel Shirley and ed. by Michael L. Morgan (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002), see Part I, Proposition 33.</ref> he directly challenges a transcendental God which actively responds to events in the universe.  Everything that has and will happen is a part of a long chain of cause and effect which, at a metaphysical level, humans are unable to change. No amount of prayer or ritual will sway God. Only knowledge of God, or the existence which humans inhabit, allows them to best respond to the world around them. Thus, according to this understanding of Spinoza's system, the universe humans currently live in and experience comes from God. God is completely impersonal to existence  because, not only is it impossible for two infinite substances to existence (two infinities being absurd),<ref>''Ethics'', Part I, Proposition 6.</ref> God - being the ultimate substance - cannot be affected by anything else, or else it would be affected by something else, and not be the fundamental substance.

In addition to substance, the other two fundamental concepts Spinoza presents and develops in the ''Ethics'' are attribute – that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance, and mode – the modifications of substance, or that which exists in, and is conceived through, something other than itself.

Spinoza was a thoroughgoing [[determinism|determinist]] who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of [[necessity]]. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand ''why'' we act as we do. So freedom is not the possibility to say "no" to what happens to us but the possibility to say "yes" and fully understand why things should necessarily happen that way. By forming more "adequate" ideas about what we do and our emotions or [[Affect (philosophy)|affections]], we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does. Therefore, humans have no free will. They believe, however, that their will is free. This illusionary perception of freedom stems from our human consciousness, experience and our indifference to prior natural causes. Humans think they are free but they ″dream with their eyes open″. For Spinoza, our actions are guided entirely by natural impulses. In his letter to G. H. Schuller (Letter 58), he wrote: "men are conscious of their desire and unaware of the causes by which [their desires] are determined."<ref>''Ethics'', Pt. I, Prop. XXXVI, Appendix: "[M]en think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire."</ref>

This picture of Spinoza's determinism is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in ''Ethics'': ″the infant believes that it is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. ... All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″<ref>''Ethics'', Part III, Proposition 2.</ref> Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience that we have a false ideal of choice predicated upon this.

Spinoza's philosophy has much in common with [[Stoicism]] inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfill a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness. However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected their contention that [[reason]] could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]].<ref>Roger Scruton, ''Spinoza, A very Short Introduction'', p.86</ref>

===Ethical philosophy===
Encapsulated at the start in his ''Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding'' (''Tractatus de intellectus emendatione'') is the core of Spinoza's ethical philosophy, what he held to be the true and final good. Spinoza held good and evil to be [[relativism|relative]] concepts, claiming that nothing is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particularity. Things that had classically been seen as good or evil, Spinoza argued, were simply good or bad for humans. Spinoza believes in a deterministic universe in which "All things in nature proceed from certain [definite] necessity and with the utmost perfection." Nothing happens by chance in Spinoza's world, and nothing is [[contingency|contingent]].

===Spinoza's ''Ethics''===
{{Main|Ethics (book)}}
In the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects, or of God/Nature. According to Spinoza, reality is perfection. If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality. While components of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason, human grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence. Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful for rhetoric, is inadequate for discovering universal truth; Spinoza's mathematical and logical approach to [[metaphysics]], and therefore ethics, concluded that emotion is formed from inadequate understanding. His concept of "[[conatus]]" states that human beings' natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being and an assertion that virtue/human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as one's central ethical doctrine. According to Spinoza, the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God/Nature/Universe.

In the final part of the "[[Ethics (book)|Ethics]]", his concern with the meaning of "true blessedness", and his explanation of how emotions must be detached from external cause and so master them, foreshadow psychological techniques developed in the 1900s. His concept of three types of knowledge – opinion, reason, intuition – and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal. His unique contribution to understanding the workings of mind is extraordinary, even during this time of radical philosophical developments, in that his views provide a bridge between religions' mystical past and psychology of the present day.

Given Spinoza's insistence on a completely ordered world where "necessity" reigns, [[Good and evil|Good and Evil]] have no absolute meaning. The world as it exists looks imperfect only because of our limited perception.

==History of reception==

===Panentheist, pantheist, or atheist?===
{{Main|Spinozism}}{{see also|Pantheism controversy}}
[[File:Baruch de Spinoza cover portrait.jpg|thumb|An early engraving of philosopher Spinoza, captioned in Latin, "A Jew and an Atheist".]]
It is a widespread belief that Spinoza equated God with the material universe. He has therefore been called the "prophet"<ref>Picton, J. Allanson, "Pantheism: Its Story and Significance", 1905</ref> and "prince"<ref>Fraser, Alexander Campbell "Philosophy of Theism", William Blackwood and Sons, 1895, p 163</ref> of [[pantheism]].  However, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg he states that: "as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken".<ref>Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (26 March 2009), ISBN 978-1-60459-156-9, letter 73</ref> For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a ''mode'' under two ''attributes'' of [[Thought]] and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]]. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world. According to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], when Spinoza wrote "''Deus sive Natura''" (God or Nature) Spinoza meant God was ''[[Natura naturans]]'' not ''[[Natura naturata]]'', and Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely [[Thought]] and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]], signified God's ''immanence''.<ref name="ts64">Karl Jaspers, Spinoza (Great Philosophers), Harvest Books (23 October 1974), ISBN 978-0-15-684730-8, Pages: 14 and 95</ref> Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course "divisible"; it has parts. But Spinoza insists that "no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided" (Which means that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance), and that "a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible" (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13).<ref name="ts65">Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (2 October 1996), ISBN 978-0-415-10782-2, Page: 40</ref> Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore the pantheist formula "One and All" would apply to Spinoza only if the "One" preserves its transcendence and the "All" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.<ref name=ts64/>

[[Martial Guéroult]] suggested the term "[[Panentheism]]", rather than "[[Pantheism]]" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, "in" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God.<ref name=ts65/> In other words, the world is a [[subset]] of God.  However, American panentheist philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]] insisted on the term [[Classical Pantheism]] to describe Spinoza's view.<ref>Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4</ref>

In 1785, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] published a condemnation of Spinoza's [[pantheism]], after [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a "Spinozist", which was the equivalent in his time of being called an atheist. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute [[atheism]]. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and pantheism. The issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late 18th-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
* the unity of all that exists;
* the regularity of all that happens; 
* the identity of spirit and nature.

Spinoza's "God or Nature" (''Deus sive Natura'') provided a living, natural God, in contrast to the [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian mechanical]] "[[First Cause]]" or the dead mechanism of the [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|French "Man Machine"]]. Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a ''religion of nature''.<ref name=tws908/> [[Novalis]] called him the "God-intoxicated man".<ref name=tws9912/><ref name=tws9902/> Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay "[[The Necessity of Atheism]]".<ref name=tws9912/>

Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word "God" (Deus) to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. "Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...."<ref>Frank Thilly, ''A History of Philosophy'', § 47, Holt & Co., New York, 1914</ref> Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God<ref>"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings." These words were spoken by Albert Einstein, upon being asked if he believed in God by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue, New York, 24 April 1921, published in the New York Times, 25 April 1929; from ''Einstein: The Life and Times'' Ronald W. Clark, New York: World Publishing Co., 1971, p. 413; also cited as a telegram to a Jewish newspaper, 1929, Einstein Archive 33-272, from Alice Calaprice, ed., ''The Expanded Quotable Einstein'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University</ref> is the antithesis to the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect”, (Ethics 2p11c) all knowing, (2p3) and capable of loving both himself—and us, insofar as we are part of his perfection. (5p35c) And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends ''amor intellectualist dei'' (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man. (5p33) However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1apendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pantheism/#Per</ref>

[[Steven Nadler]] suggests that settling the question of Spinoza's atheism or pantheism depends on an analysis of attitudes. If pantheism is associated with religiosity, then Spinoza is not a pantheist, since Spinoza believes that the proper stance to take towards God is not one of reverence or religious awe, but instead one of objective study and reason, since taking the religious stance would leave one open to the possibility of error and superstition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#GodNat |title=Baruch Spinoza (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref>

===Comparison to Eastern philosophies===
Similarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authorities. The 19th-century German Sanskritist [[Theodore Goldstücker]] was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the [[Vedanta]] tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was "... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy."<ref>Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker, W. H. Allen, 1879. p32.</ref><ref>The Westminster Review, Volumes 78-79, Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, 1862. p1862</ref>

[[Max Muller]], in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying "the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'."<ref>Three Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy. F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p123</ref> [[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay "As to Spinoza's Deity—natura naturans—conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity—as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct outflowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple."<ref>H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings, Volume 13, pages 308-310. Quest Books</ref>

===Spinoza's political theory===
{{Main|Tractatus Theologico-Politicus}}
Late 20th-century Europe demonstrated a greater philosophical interest in Spinoza, often from a left-wing or [[Marxist]] perspective. [[Karl Marx]] liked Spinoza's account of the universe, interpreting it as materialistic.<ref name=tws908/> Notable philosophers [[Louis Althusser]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Étienne Balibar]] and [[Marilena Chaui]] have each drawn upon Spinoza's philosophy. Deleuze's doctoral thesis, published in 1968, refers to him as "the prince of philosophers."<ref>Deleuze, 1968.</ref> Other philosophers heavily influenced by Spinoza include [[Constantin Brunner]] and [[John David Garcia]]. [[Stuart Hampshire]] wrote a major English language study of Spinoza, though [[H. H. Joachim]]'s work is equally valuable. Unlike most philosophers, Spinoza was highly regarded by [[Nietzsche]].

Spinoza was an important philosophical inspiration for [[George Santayana]]. When Santayana graduated from college, he published an essay, "The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza", in ''The Harvard Monthly''.<ref>George Santayana, "The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza", ''The Harvard Monthly'', 2 (June 1886: 144–52)</ref> Later, he wrote an introduction to ''Spinoza's Ethics and "De intellectus emendatione"''.<ref>George Santayana, "Introduction", in ''Spinoza's Ethics and "De intellectus emendatione"''(London: Dent, 1910, vii–xxii)</ref> In 1932, Santayana was invited to present an essay (published as "Ultimate Religion")<ref>George Santayana, "Ultimate Religion", in ''Obiter Scripta'', eds. Justus Buchler and Benjamin Schwartz (New York and London: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1936) 280-297.</ref> at a meeting at [[The Hague]] celebrating the tricentennial of Spinoza's birth. In Santayana's autobiography, he characterized Spinoza as his "master and model" in understanding the naturalistic basis of morality.<ref>George Santayana, ''Persons and Places'' (Cambridge, MA and London: MIT Press, 1986) 233–36.</ref>

===Spinoza's religious criticism and its effect on the philosophy of language===
[[File:Spinoza Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.jpg|right|thumb|''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'']]
Philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] evoked Spinoza with the title (suggested to him by [[G. E. Moore]]) of the English translation of his first definitive philosophical work, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', an allusion to Spinoza's ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]''. Elsewhere, Wittgenstein deliberately borrowed the expression ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'' from Spinoza (''Notebooks, 1914-16'', p.&nbsp;83). The structure of his ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' does have some structural affinities with Spinoza's ''Ethics'' (though, admittedly, not with the latter's own ''Tractatus'') in erecting complex philosophical arguments upon basic logical assertions and principles. Furthermore, in propositions 6.4311 and 6.45 he alludes to a Spinozian understanding of eternity and interpretation of the religious concept of eternal life, stating that "If by eternity is understood not eternal temporal duration, but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present." (6.4311) "The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation as a limited whole." (6.45)

[[Leo Strauss]] dedicated his first book ("Spinoza's Critique of Religion") to an examination of the latter's ideas. In the book, Strauss identified Spinoza as part of the tradition of Enlightenment rationalism that eventually produced Modernity. Moreover, he identifies Spinoza and his works as the beginning of Jewish Modernity.<ref name=tws9912/> More recently [[Jonathan Israel]], Professor of Modern European History at The [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], has made a detailed case that from 1650 to 1750 Spinoza was "the chief challenger of the fundamentals of revealed religion, received ideas, tradition, morality, and what was everywhere regarded, in absolutist and non-absolutist states alike, as divinely constituted political authority."<ref>Israel, J. (2001) Radical Enlightenment; Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750, Oxford, Oxford University Press, p159.</ref>

===Spinoza in literature and popular culture===
Spinoza has had influence beyond the confines of philosophy. The 19th century novelist [[George Eliot]] produced her own translation of the ''Ethics'', the first known English translation of it. Eliot liked Spinoza's vehement attacks on superstition.<ref name=tws908/> In his autobiography "From My Life: Poetry and Truth", Goethe recounts the way in which Spinoza's ''Ethics'' calmed the sometimes unbearable emotional turbulence of his youth. Goethe later displayed his grasp of Spinoza's metaphysics in a fragmentary elucidation of some Spinozist ontological principles entitled ''Study After Spinoza''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.textlog.de/41473.html |title=Goethe: Studie nach Spinoza - Aufsätze und Rezensionen |publisher=Textlog.de |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2011|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110513034307/http://www.textlog.de/41473.html |archivedate = 13 May 2011|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Moreover, he cited Spinoza alongside Shakespeare and [[Carl Linnaeus]] as one of the three strongest influences on his life and work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html |title=Linné on line - What people have said about Linnaeus |publisher=Linnaeus.uu.se |accessdate=2 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110608101238/http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html| archivedate= 8 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The 20th century novelist [[W. Somerset Maugham]] alluded to one of Spinoza's central concepts with the title of his novel ''[[Of Human Bondage]]''. [[Albert Einstein]] named Spinoza as the philosopher who exerted the most influence on his world view ([[Weltanschauung]]). Spinoza equated God (infinite substance) with Nature, consistent with Einstein's belief in an impersonal deity. In 1929, Einstein was asked in a telegram by [[Herbert S. Goldstein|Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein]] whether he believed in God. Einstein responded by telegram: "I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings."<ref name=tws9903>{{cite news

Spinoza is an important historical figure in the [[Netherlands]], where his portrait was featured prominently on the Dutch 1000-[[Dutch guilder|guilder]] [[banknote]], [[legal tender]] until the euro was introduced in 2002. The highest and most prestigious scientific award of the Netherlands is named the [[Spinoza Prize|''Spinozaprijs'' (Spinoza prize)]]. Spinoza was included in a 50 theme canon that attempts to summarise the history of the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entoen.nu/ |title=Entoen.nu |publisher=Entoen.nu |accessdate=2 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110513033928/http://www.entoen.nu/| archivedate= 13 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
