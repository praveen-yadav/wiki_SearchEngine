 }}</ref> DiFranco has been a critical darling for much of her career.

Although DiFranco's music has been classified as both [[folk rock]] and [[alternative rock]], she has reached across genres since her earliest albums incorporating first [[punk rock|punk]], then [[funk]], [[hip hop]], and [[jazz]] influences. She was one of the first independent musicians to create her own record label ([[Righteous Babe]]), a move that has given her significant creative freedom.

From the earliest days of her career, DiFranco has lent her voice and her name to a broad range of social movements, performing benefit concerts, appearing on benefit albums, and speaking at rallies. Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed various grassroots cultural and political organizations, supporting causes ranging from abortion rights to gay visibility.

==Life and career==
DiFranco was born in [[Buffalo, New York]],<ref>[http://celebritybabynamesblog.com/2007/01/24/baby-girl-for-rock-musician-ani-difranco/ Celebritybabynamesblog.com]</ref> the daughter of Elizabeth (Ross) and Dante Americo DiFranco, who had met while attending [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].<ref>[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003709/Ani-DiFranco.html Ani DiFranco Biography – Discography, Music, Lyrics, Album, CD, Career, Famous Works, and Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/dante/index.asp Dante Americo DiFranco Memorial Page]</ref><ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1041E247A98F4F42&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM]</ref> Her father was of Italian descent, and her mother was from Montreal.<ref>http://www.musicvice.com/reviews/ani_difranco_montreal_november_2008.html</ref> DiFranco started playing [[The Beatles|Beatles]] covers at local bars and [[busking]] with her guitar teacher, Michael Meldrum,<ref>[http://www.righteousbabe.com/store/prod_albums.asp?id=473 Notes on the album ''Open Ended Question'']</ref> at the age of nine. By fourteen she was penning her own songs and playing her original material at bars and coffee houses throughout her teen years. DiFranco graduated from the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts high school at the age of sixteen and began attending classes at Buffalo State College that same year. She was already living alone, having moved out of her mother's apartment after she became an emancipated minor at age 15.<ref>http://www.eric-goldscheider.com/id83.html</ref>

In 1989 at the age of 18, DiFranco started her own record company, [[Righteous Babe Records|Righteous Records]].<ref name="MilwaukeeJS2006"/> 
Her [[Ani DiFranco (album)|self-titled debut album]] was issued on the label in the winter of 1990 shortly after, she had relocated to [[New York City]]. In New York she took [[poetry]] classes at [[The New School]] where she met poet [[Sekou Sundiata]] who was to become a friend and mentor. She began touring vigorously for the next 15 years, essentially pausing briefly only to record albums. Appearances at Canadian folk festivals and increasingly larger venues in the U.S. cemented her growing presence on the North American folk and roots scene.

In September 1996, DiFranco participated in a concert at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland Ohio, inaugurating the opening of the [[Woody Guthrie]] Archives in New York City. She later released a CD by Righteous Babe of the concert entitled "Til We Outnumber Em" (featuring artists such as DiFranco, Billy Bragg, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Arlo Guthrie, Indigo Girls, Dave Pirner, Tim Robbins, and Bruce Springsteen) with 100% of proceeds going to the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum educational department.<ref>Robicheau, Paul. Ellis Paul’s got Woody Guthrie under his skin. Boston Globe, September 20, 1996.</ref>

DiFranco toured solo throughout the early and mid 1990s and also as a duo with a Canadian drummer named Andy Stochansky. Bassist [[Sara Lee (musician)|Sara Lee]] joined the touring group in 1996. Their [[rapport]] during live shows is showcased on the 1997 album ''[[Living in Clip]]''. DiFranco would later release Lee's solo album ''Make It Beautifu''l on Righteous Babe.

In 1998, Stochansky left to pursue a solo career as a singer-songwriter. A new touring ensemble consisting of Jason Mercer on bass, Julie Wolf on keyboards, and Daren Hahn on drums, augmented at times by a horn section, accompanied DiFranco on tour from 1998-2002.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lankford Jr.|first=Ronnie|title=review, So Much Shouting|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/so-much-shouting-so-much-laughter-mw0000227692|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=29 July 2013}}</ref>

The 1990s were a period of heightened exposure for DiFranco, as she continued playing ever larger venues around the world and attracted international attention of the press, including cover stories in ''Spin, Ms., ''and'' Magnet, ''among others,<ref>{{cite web|last=Righteous Babe|title=covers gallery|url=http://righteousbabe.myshopify.com/products/cover-shots|publisher=RBR web site|accessdate=29 July 2013}}</ref> as well as appearances on MTV and VH1. Her playfully ironic cover of the Bacharach/David song "Wishin' and Hopin'" appeared under the opening titles of the hit film ''My Best Friends Wedding''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/my-best-friends-wedding-original-soundtrack-mw0000023914|work=my best friends wedding soundtrack|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=29 July 2013}}</ref>

Beginning in 1999, Righteous Babe Records began to release albums by other artists including Sekou Sundiata, Michael Meldrum, Arto Lindsay, Bitch and Animal, That One Guy, Utah Phillips, Hamell on Trial, Andrew Bird, Kurt Swinghammer. Sara Lee, Buddy Wakefield, Anais Mitchell, and Nona Hendryx.

On September 11, 2001 DiFranco was in Manhattan and later penned the epic poem "Self Evident" about the experience. The poem was featured in the book ''It's a Free Country: Personal Freedon in America After September 11, ''edited by Danny Goldberg, Victoria Goldberg, and Robert Greenwald. The poem's title also became the name of DiFranco's first book of poetry released exclusively in Italy by Minimum Fax. It was later featured in a book of her poetry published in the U.S. by Seven Stories press, entitled ''Verses''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ani|first=DiFranco|title=Verses|year=2007|publisher=Seven Stories Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781583228234|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ho9r6AGkZfMC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=sekou+sundiata+and+ani+difranco&source=bl&ots=Ztr2OOGKaF&sig=NrD-jkiSk_Qi3xVqlje6q3pZOuA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eJH2UdzGIoiQrQfj74CoAw&ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=sekou%20sundiata%20and%20ani%20difranco&f=false}}</ref> DiFranco has written and performed many spoken-word pieces throughout her career and was showcased as a poet on the HBO series ''Def Poetry'' in 2005

Her father died early in the summer of 2004.<ref>[https://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/reprieve/reviews.asp "Still Fighting"] Review in Paste. September 2006.</ref> In July 2005, DiFranco developed [[tendonitis]] and took a nine month hiatus from touring.

On September 11, 2007, she released the first retrospective of her career, a two disc compilation entitled ''[[Canon (album)|Canon]]'' and simultaneously released a retrospective collection of poetry book ''Verses''. ''[[Red Letter Year]]'' was released on September 30, 2008.
[[File:Ani difranco 2008-01-17.jpg|thumb|DiFranco performing in 2008]]

DiFranco performed a live webcast from [[Ex'pression College for Digital Arts]]<ref>[http://www.creativeallies.com/more/expression-ani-difranco Creativeallies.com]</ref> on June 24, 2010.

(a reworking of the Florence Reece song with different lyrics penned by DiFranco), "Life Boat", "Unworry", "Promiscuity", "Splinter", "Amendment", "See See..." and "Hearse".

DiFranco's touring band and recordings have featured the bass player [[Todd Sickafoose]] since her 2005 release ''Knuckle Down ''(co-produced by Joe Henry) and in turns other musicians such as [[Allison Miller (drummer)|Allison Miller]], Andy Borger, Herlin Riley, and Terence Higgins on drums and  [[Mike Dillon (musician)|Mike Dillon]] on percussion and vibes.

In 2009 DiFranco appeared at Pete Seeger's 90th birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden, debuting her revamped version of the 1930s labor anthem "Which Side Are You On?" in a duet with Bruce Cockburn and also duetting with Kris Kristofferson on the folk classic " There's a Hole in the Bucket".

DiFranco released an album of new material on January 17, 2012, titled "¿Which Side Are You On?". It includes collaborations with [[Pete Seeger]], [[Ivan Neville]], [[Cyril Neville]], [[Skerik]], [[Adam Levy]], Righteous Babe recording artist [[Anaïs Mitchell]], [[CC Adcock]], and a host of New Orleans-based horn players known for their work in such outfits as [[Galactic]], [[Bonerama]], and [[Rebirth Brass Band]].

===Relationships===
DiFranco identifies herself as [[bisexual]],<ref>[http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Music/112004/anidifranco.html Ani DiFranco, Folksinger and Entrepreneur] by Kris Scott Marti, November 28, 2004</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_n748/ai_20088650 Find articles.com], by Achy Obejas, The Advocate, December 9, 1997</ref> and has written songs about love and sex with women and men.

==Critical reception==
DiFranco has been a critical darling for much of her career, though not a commercial one, by major label standards, with a career album average of 72 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/person/ani-difranco Ani DiFranco on Metacritic]. Accessed on October 1, 2011.</ref>  Living In Clip, DiFranco's 1998 double live album is the only one to achieve gold record status to date. DiFranco has been toasted by the  ''Buffalo News'' as the "Buffalo's leading lady of rock music." The ''News'' further said:<blockquote>

Starting in 2003, DiFranco was nominated four consecutive times for [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Recording Package]] at the [[Grammy Awards]], winning in [[46th Grammy Awards|2004]], for ''[[Evolve (Ani DiFranco album)|Evolve]]''.

On July 21, 2006, DiFranco received the [[Woman of Courage Award Winners|"Woman of Courage Award"]]<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/07/21/late-news-ani-difranco-adam-green-chris-cornell-lily-allen-janet-jackson/ Rolling Stone news]</ref> at the [[National Organization for Women|National Organization for Women (NOW)]] Conference and Young Feminist Summit in [[Albany, New York]]. Past winners have included singer and actress [[Barbra Streisand]] and Sen. [[Barbara Boxer]], [[U.S. Democratic Party|D]]-[[California|Calif.]]  DiFranco is one of the first musicians to receive the award, given each year to a woman who has set herself apart by her contributions to the feminist movement.

DiFranco was also the recipient of the Woody Guthrie Award for being a voice of positive social change, at the 13th Annual Guthrie Awards Dinner in 2009.<ref>http://folkmusic.about.com/b/2009/10/07/ani-difranco-to-receive-woody-guthrie-award.htm</ref></blockquote>

==Music==

===Style===
DiFranco's guitar playing is often characterized by a signature [[staccato]] style,<ref>[http://folkmusic.about.com/od/artistsaz/p/AniD_profile.htm Facts about Ani]</ref><ref>[http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/06.11/revani.html Ani DiFranco, Living in Clip by Jon Steltenpohl]</ref> rapid [[fingerpicking]] and many alternate tunings. She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. Her lyrics, which often include [[alliteration]], [[metaphor]], [[word play]] and a more or less gentle [[irony]], have also received praise for their sophistication.
[[File:Ani DiFranco concert.jpg|thumb|DiFranco in concert]]

Although DiFranco's music has been classified as both [[folk rock]] and [[alternative rock]], she has reached across genres since her earliest albums incorporating first punk, then funk, hiphop, and jazz influences.

While primarlly an acoustic guitarist she has used a variety of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and styles: [[brass instrument]]ation was prevalent in 1998's ''[[Little Plastic Castle]]''; a simple [[walking bass]] in her 1997 cover of [[Hal David]] and [[Burt Bacharach]]'s "[[Wishin' and Hopin']]"; [[string instrument|strings]] on the 1997 live album ''[[Living in Clip]]'' and 2004's ''[[Knuckle Down]]''; and electronics and [[synthesiser]]s in 1999's ''To the Teeth'' and 2006's ''[[Reprieve (album)|Reprieve]]''.

DiFranco herself noted that "folk music is not an acoustic guitar – that's not where the heart of it is. I use the word 'folk' in reference to [[punk music]] and [[rap music]]. It's an attitude, it's an awareness of one's heritage, and it's a community. It's subcorporate music that gives voice to different communities and their struggle against authority."<ref name=":0">[http://www.jeffreypepperrodgers.com/difranco.htm Rock Troubadours] by Jeffrey Pepper Rodgers</ref>

===Musical collaborations, cover versions, and samples===
DiFranco has also collaborated with a wide range of artists. In 1997 she appeared on Canadian songwriter Bruce Cockburn’s Charity of Night album. In 1998 she produced fellow folksinger Dan Bern’s album 50 Eggs.

She developed a deep association with folksinger and social activist [[Utah Phillips]] throughout the mid-1990s, sharing her stage and her audience with the older musician until his death in 2008 and resulting in two collaborative albums: The Past Didn't Go Anywhere, 1996, and Fellow Workers,1999 (with liner notes by [[Howard Zinn]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Zinn|title=Fellow Workers Liner Notes|url=http://zinnedproject.org/materials/fellow-workers-liner-notes-by-howard-zinn/|publisher=Zinn Education Project|accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref> The Past is built around Phillips’s storytelling, an important part of his art that had not previously been documented on recordings; on the album, DiFranco provides musical settings for his speaking voice.<ref name=":0" /> The followup, Fellow Workers, was recorded live in [[Daniel Lanois]]’s Kingsway Studio in New Orleans and features Phillips fronting DiFranco’s touring band for a collection of songs and stories.

[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] recorded two songs with DiFranco in 1999, "Providence" on her To the Teeth album, and "I Love U, But I Don't Trust U Anymore" on Prince's Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic album.<ref>http://princetext.tripod.com/i_startrib99.html</ref> Funk and soul jazz musician [[Maceo Parker]] and rapper Corey Parker have both appeared on DiFranco’s albums<ref>{{cite web|title=To The Teeth, album|url=http://www.righteousbabe.com/products/to-the-teeth#.UfvOZ6xH5IA|publisher=Righteous Babe Web Site|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref> and featured appearances by her on theirs.

She has appeared on several compilations of the songs of [[Pete Seeger]] and frequented his Hudson Clearwater Revival Festival.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toshi Reagon and Ani DiFranco|url=http://vimeo.com/64338104|work=Vimeo, video gallery|publisher=Hudson River Sloop Clearwater|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>  In 2001 she appeared on Brazilian artist Lenine’s album Falange Canibal. In 2002 her rendition of Greg Brown’s “The Poet Game” appeared on Going Driftless: An Artist’s Tribute To Greg Brown. Also in 2002 she recorded a duet with [[Jackie Chan]] of the Irving Gordon song “Unforgettable” for a record of unlikely collaborations entitled When Pigs Fly: Songs You Never Thought You’d Hear.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kenny|title=Ani DiFranco & Jackie Chan – "Unforgettable" (Nat King Cole Cover)|url=http://quitmumbling.com/2011/04/uncovered-ani-difranco-jackie-chan-unforgettable-nat-king-cole/|publisher=Quit Mumbling|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>

In 2005 she appeared on [[Dar Williams]]’ record My Better Self, dueting on William’s cover of Pink Floyd’s “Comfortably Numb”. She performed with [[Cyndi Lauper]] on “Sisters of Avalon” a track from Lauper’s 2005 The Body Acoustic album. In 2006 she produced [[Hamell on Trial]]’s album Songs For Parents Who Enjoy Drugs. In 2008 she appeared on Todd Sickafoose’s album Tiny Resisters. In 2010 she co-produced a track with [[Margaret Cho]] called “Captain Cameltoe” for the comedian’s Cho Dependant album. In 2011 she appeared on [[Rob Wasserman]]’s album Note of Hope, an exploration of the writings of Woody Guthrie with musical accompaniment, though the track in which she appeared,“Voice”, was actually recorded 13 years earlier. Also in 2011 she duetted with [[Greg Dulli]] on the Twilight Singers record Dynamite Steps.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ani DiFranco credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ani-difranco-mn0000046794/credits|publisher=All Music Guide|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>

Other artists have covered and sampled DiFranco’s work throughout the years. Her spoken word poem “Self Evident” was covered by Public Enemy founder [[Chuck D]]’s group called Impossibulls. [[Alana Davis]] had some commercial success with DiFranco's song [[32 Flavors]].

Samples from the track "Coming Up" were used by [[DJ Spooky]] in his album Live Without Dead Time, produced for [[AdBusters]] Magazine in 2003.

===Lyrics, politics and religion===
Although much of DiFranco's material is autobiographical, it is often also strongly political. Many of her songs are concerned with contemporary social issues such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[sexual abuse]], [[homophobia]], [[reproductive rights]], [[poverty]], and [[war]]. In 2008, she donated a song to [[Aid Still Required|Aid Still Required's]] CD to assist with the restoration of the devastation done to Southeast Asia from the 2004 Tsunami.
The combination of personal and political is partially responsible for DiFranco's early popularity among politically active college students, particularly those of the [[Left-wing politics|left wing]], some of whom set up fan pages on the [[World Wide Web|web]] to document DiFranco's career as early as 1994. DiFranco's rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s was fueled mostly by personal contact and word of mouth rather than [[mainstream media]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}<ref name=":1" />

DiFranco has expressed political views outside of her music. During the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]], she actively supported and voted for [[Green Party (US)|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]].<ref>HackWriters.com article: "[http://www.hackwriters.com/difranco04.htm Ani DiFranco interview]".</ref><ref>''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine article: "[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5925399/eddie_vedder_patti_smith_go_green_at_nyc_nader_rally/print Eddie Vedder, Patti Smith Go Green at NYC Nader Rally – Nader rally draws Vedder, DiFranco to Madison Square Garden]"</ref><ref>Salon.com article: "[http://dir.salon.com/story/politics/feature/2000/11/06/letters/index1.html The Nader Letters]".</ref> She supported [[Dennis Kucinich]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004]] and [[2008 Democratic primaries]]. Kucinich appeared with her at a number of concerts across the country during both primary seasons.<ref>{{cite web

DiFranco has described herself as an [[atheist]]. On the subject of religion, DiFranco has stated:
<blockquote>"Well, I'm not a religious person myself. I'm an atheist. I think religion serves a lot of different purposes in people's lives, and I can recognize the value of that, you know, the value of ceremony, the value of community, or even just having a forum to get together and talk about ideas, about morals – that's a cool concept. But then, of course, institutional religions are so problematic."<ref>{{cite news

===Label independence===
DiFranco was one of the first independent artists to own her own label, she cites her anti-corporate ethos for the main reason she decided to start her own label. This has allowed her a considerable degree of creative freedom<ref>{{cite web|last=Burlingham|first=Bo|title=Don't call Her an Entrepreneur|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20040901/difranco.html|publisher=INC. Magazine|accessdate=29 July 2013}}</ref>  over the years, including, for example, providing all instrumentals and vocals and recording the album herself at her home on an analog 8-track [[reel to reel]], and handling much of the artwork and packaging design for her 2004 album ''[[Educated Guess]]''.<ref>[http://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/educated_guess/more_info.asp Educated guess article]</ref> She has referenced this independence from major labels in song more than once, including "The Million You Never Made" (''[[Not A Pretty Girl]]''), which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, "The Next Big Thing" (''[[Not So Soft]]''), which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and "Napoleon" (''[[Dilate (Ani DiFranco album)|Dilate]]''), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label.

The business grew organically starting in 1990 with the first cassette tape. Connections were made when women in colleges started duplicating and sharing tapes.Offers to play at colleges started coming in and her popularity grew largely by word of mouth and through women’s groups or organizations.<ref name=":1">http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/ani_difranco-lil_folksinger_that_could</ref> Zango and Goldenrod, two music distributors specializing in women’s music, started carrying DiFranco’s music. In general they sold music to independent music stores and women’s book stores. In 1995 Righteous Babe Records signed with Koch International for DiFranco’s release of Not a Pretty Girl. Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike.

DiFranco has occasionally joined with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in discussing publicly the problems associated with major record companies. Righteous Babe Records employs a number of people in her hometown of Buffalo. In a 1997 open letter to ''[[Ms. magazine]]''<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~marg/ani/letter.html Interview with Ms. Magazine]</ref> she expressed displeasure that what she considers a way to ensure her own artistic freedom was seen by others solely in terms of its financial success.

==Activism==
From the earliest days of her career, Ani DiFranco has lent her voice and her name to a broad range of social movements, performing benefit concerts, appearing on benefit albums, speaking at rallies, and offering info table space to organizations at her concerts and the virtual equivalent on her website, among other methods and actions. In 1999 she created her own not-for-profit organization; as the Buffalo News has reported,"Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed various grassroots cultural and political organizations, supporting causes ranging from abortion rights to gay visibility."<ref>{{cite news|last=HEAREY|first=OWEN|title='Righteous Babe' announces she is pregnant DiFranco honored at NOW convention|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060722/CITYANDREGION/307229989|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=July 22, 2006}}</ref>

During the first Gulf War, DiFranco participated in the anti-war movement. In the early 1993 she played Pete Seeger’s Clearwater Folk Festival for the first time. In 1998 she was a featured performer in the Dead Man Walking benefit concert series<ref>{{cite web|last=News|first=MTV|title=Vedder, Tom Waits, Ani DiFranco Set For "Dead Man" Benefit|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428080/vedder-tom-waits-ani-difranco-set-dead-man-benefit.jhtml|publisher=MTV.com|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref>  raising money for Sister [[Helen Prejean]]’s “Not in Our Name” anti-death penalty organization. DiFranco’s commitment to opposing the death penalty is longstanding; she has also been a long time supporter of the [[Southern Center for Human Rights]].

In 2004 DiFranco visited Burma in order to learn about the Burmese resistance movement and the country’s fight for democracy.<ref>{{cite web|last=alzner|first=susan|title=documentary photography|url=http://www.susanalzner.com/gallery.html?folio=Documentary&gallery=Burma%20and%20Thailand%20with%20Ani%20DiFranco%20and%20Damien%20Rice|publisher=susan alzner photography|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> During her travels she met with then-detained resistance leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]. Her song "In The Way" was later featured on [[For the Lady]], a benefit CD that donated all proceeds to the United States Campaign for Burma.<ref>{{cite web|last=saks|first=carla|title=press release|url=http://uscampaignforburma.org/news/press-releases/22-archived-press-releases/2474-for-the-lady-bene-t-album-to-be-released-october-26th-on-rhino-records.html|publisher=US Campaign for Burma|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref>

On the home front, DiFranco has also been outspoken defender of democracy. During the 2004 presidential primaries, she openly and enthusiastically supported liberal, anti-war Democrat Dennis Kucinich.  Congressman Kucinich appeared on stage with her at several concerts and she spoke positively about him from the stage at many more of her concerts.  After the primary season ended, and Kerry was the clear Democratic candidate, DiFranco wrote an open letter of conditional support for independent candidate [[Ralph Nader]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Solon Staff|title=The Nader letters|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/11/06/letters_7/|publisher=Solon.com|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> The same year she launched a “Vote, Dammit” tour of swing states encouraging audience members to register to vote.<ref>{{cite news|last=Buchel|first=John|title=Ani DiFranco challenges fans to vote|url=http://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2004/09/17/ani_difranco_challen.php|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=The Badger Herald|date=September 17, 2004}}</ref> In 2005 she lobbied Congress against the proliferation of nuclear power in general and the placement of nuclear waste dumps on Indian land in particular.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mariotte|first=Michael|title=JULY 25: Senate Call-in Day!

In 2002 Righteous Babe Records established the "Aiding Buffalo’s Children"program in conjunction with members of the local community to raise funds for Buffalo's imperiled public school system. To kick off the program, DiFranco donated "a day's pay"—the performance fee from her concert that year at Shea’s Performing Arts Center— to ABC and challenged her fans to do the same. Aiding Buffalo’s Children has since been folded into the Community Foundation of Greater Buffalo, contributing to a variety of charitable funds.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shultz|first=Erin|title=Music and Her Message: DiFranco at Shea's|url=http://www.ubspectrum.com/arts/music-and-her-message-difranco-at-shea-s-1.1393961#.UfghPdLVCSo|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=The Spectrum|date=April 10, 2002}}</ref>

In 2005 when Hurricane Katrina devastated DiFranco’s newly adopted home town of New Orleans she collected donations from fans around the world through The Righteous Babe Store website for the Katrina Piano Fund,<ref>{{cite news|last=Pinsonneault|first=Julie|title=Bearing Witness  "New Orleans favorite Ani DiFranco endured 9/11 while in New York City and Hurricane Katrina while in New Orleans.|url=http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/bearing-witness/Content?oid=1245650|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=Gambit|date=2006-04-25}}</ref> helping musicians replace instruments lost in the hurricane, raising over $47,500 for the cause.

In 2010 when the BP Oil Spill crippled the Gulf she donated her talents to the “For Our Coast”benefit concert joining [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[C.C. Adcock]] and others at the Acadiana Center for the Arts Theater in Lafayette, raising money for Gulf Aid Acadiana, and the Gulf Aid show with [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Mos Def]], and many more at Mardi Gras World River City in New Orleans, both shows raising money to help protect the wetlands, clean up the coast and to assist the fishermen and their families affected by the spill.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|title=Lenny Kravitz Headlining Gulf Aid To Benefit Oil Spill Recovery|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1638853/lenny-kravitz-headlining-concert-benefit-gulf-coast.jhtml|publisher=MTV.com|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref>

DiFranco also sits on the board for the Roots of Music Program,<ref>{{cite web|last=cafe|first=world|title=Ani DiFranco's Fresh Perspective On New Orleans|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/06/13/154873409/sense-of-place-ani-difrancos-fresh-perspective-on-new-orleans|work=video|publisher=NPR|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> founded by Rebirth Brass Band drummer Derrick Tabb. The organization fills a void in music education in New Orleans educational institutions by providing free Marching Band instruction to area children in addition to academic tutoring and mentoring.

DiFranco joined about 500,000 people at the March for Women's Lives in DC in April of 2004 to voice her support for women’s rights. As an honored guest she marched in the front row for the three-mile route, along with [[Margaret Cho]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Gloria Steinem]] and many others. Later in the day, Ani played a few songs on the main stage in front of the Capitol, including "Your Next Bold Move".<ref>{{cite web|last=Righteous Babe Site|title=March for Wemons lives photos|url=http://righteousbabe.myshopify.com/products/ani-marches-and-sings-in-washington-d-c|publisher=righteousbabe.com|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref>

Scot Fisher, Righteous Babe label president and DiFranco’s longtime manager, has been a longtime advocate of the preservation movement in Buffalo. In 1999 he and DiFranco purchased a decaying church on the verge of demolition in downtown Buffalo and began the lengthy process of restoring it. In 2006 the building opened its doors again, first briefly as “The Church” and then as “Babeville,” housing two concert venues, the record label’s business office, and Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center.<ref>{{cite web|last=Conaway|first=James|title=An exchange with Ani DiFranco|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2004/november-december/an-exchange-with-ani-difranco.html|work=Preservation|publisher=preservationnation.org|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref>
