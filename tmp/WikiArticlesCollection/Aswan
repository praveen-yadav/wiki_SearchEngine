'''Aswan''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˌ|æ|s|ˈ|w|ɑː|n|}}; {{lang-arz|أسوان}} ''{{transl|arz|Aswān&nbsp;}}'' {{IPA-arz|ʔɑsˈwɑːn|}}; [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]]: ''{{transl|egy|Swenett}}''<span style="margin:2.5px;">;</span> {{lang-cop|ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ}} ''{{transl|cop|Souan}}''<span style="margin:2.5px;">;</span> {{lang-grc|Συήνη}} ''{{transl|grc|Syene}}''<span style="margin:1.5px;">)</span>, formerly spelled ''Assuan''<span style="margin:1px;">,</span> is a city in the south of [[Egypt]], the capital of the [[Aswan Governorate]].

Aswan is a busy market and tourist centre located just north of the [[Aswan Dams]] on the east bank of the [[Nile]] at the [[first cataract]]. The modern city has expanded and includes the formerly separate community on the island of [[Elephantine]].

== History ==

{{Hiero | ''swnt.t'' | <hiero>s-E34:n-t:niwt</hiero> | align=left | era=default}}
Aswan is the ancient city of '''''Swenett'''''<span style="margin:1px;">,</span> which in antiquity was the frontier town of [[Ancient Egypt]] facing the south. Swenett is supposed to have derived its name from an Egyptian [[goddess]] with the same name.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} This goddess later was identified as [[Eileithyia]] by the Greeks and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]] by the Romans during their occupation of Ancient Egypt because of the similar association of their goddesses with childbirth, and of which the import is "the opener".  The ancient name of the city also is said to be derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] symbol for ''trade''<span style="margin:1px;">.</span><ref>{{Cite book|title=Muhafazat Al Gumhuriya Al Arabiya Al Mutaheda wa Asaraha al baqiah fi al asr al islamim|year=1966|author=Suʻād Māhir|publisher=Majlis al-Aʻlá lil-Shuʼūn al-Islāmīyah|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jEL5GwAACAAJ}}</ref>

Because the [[Ancient Egyptians]] oriented toward the origin of the life-giving waters of the Nile in the south, Swenet was the first town in the country, and [[Egypt]] always was conceived to "open" or begin at Swenet.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The city stood upon a peninsula on the right (east) bank of the [[Nile]], immediately below (and north of) the first cataract of the flowing waters, which extend to it from [[Philae]]. Navigation to the delta was possible from this location without encountering a barrier.

The [[stone quarries of ancient Egypt]] located here were celebrated for their stone, and especially for the granitic rock called Syenite. They furnished the colossal statues, [[obelisk]]s, and monolithal shrines that are found throughout Egypt, including the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]; and the traces of the quarrymen who wrought in these 3,000 years ago are still visible in the native rock. They lie on either bank of the [[Nile]], and a road, {{convert|4|mi|km}} in length, was cut beside them from Syene to [[Philae]].

Swentet was equally important as a military station as that of a place of traffic. Under every dynasty it was a garrison town; and here tolls and customs were levied on all boats passing southwards and northwards. Around AD 330, the legion stationed here received a bishop from [[Alexandria]]; this later became the [[Coptic Diocese of Syene]].<ref>Dijkstra, J. Harm F. [http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/theology/2005/j.h.f.dijkstra/thesis.pdf ''Religious Encounters on the Southern Egyptian Frontier in Late Antiquity (AD 298-642)].<!--accessed 23 June 2009--></ref> The city is mentioned by numerous ancient writers, including [[Herodotus]],<ref>(ii. 30)</ref> [[Strabo]],<ref>(ii. p.&nbsp;133, xvii. p.&nbsp;797, ''seq.'')</ref> [[Stephanus of Byzantium]],<ref>(''s. v.'')</ref> [[Ptolemy]],<ref>(vii. 5. § 15, viii. 15. § 15)</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]],<ref>(ii. 73. s. 75, v. 10. s. 11, vi. 29. s. 34)</ref> [[De architectura]],<ref>(book viii. ch ii. § 6)</ref> and it appears on the [[Antonine Itinerary]].<ref>(p.&nbsp;164)</ref> It also is mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] and the [[Book of Isaiah]].<ref>Ezekiel 29:10, 30:6; Isaiah 49:12</ref>

The [[latitude]] of the city that would become Aswan – located at 24° 5′ 23″ – was an object of great interest to the ancient geographers. They believed that it was seated immediately under the [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic]], and that on the day of the [[summer solstice]], a vertical staff cast no shadow. They noted that the sun's disc was reflected in a well at noon. This statement is only approximately correct; at the summer solstice, the shadow was only <sup>1</sup>/<sub>400</sub>th of the staff, and so could scarcely be discerned, and the northern limb of the Sun's disc would be nearly vertical.

[[Eratosthenes]] used measurements at Aswan ([[Elephantine]]) to determine the [[circumference]] of Earth, using [[Syene]] as the originating point and [[Alexandria]] as the terminal point of a measured arc (based on shadow length at the solstice).

The [[Nile]] is nearly 3,000 yards wide above Aswan. From this frontier town to the northern extremity of Egypt, the river flows for more than {{convert|750|mi|km}} without bar or cataract. The voyage from Aswan to Alexandria usually took 21 to 28 days in favourable weather.

{{Refimprove|section called "Climate"|date=June 2011}}
