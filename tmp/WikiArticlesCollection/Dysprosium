{{infobox dysprosium}}
'''Dysprosium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Dy''' and [[atomic number]] 66. It is a [[rare earth element]] with a metallic silver luster. Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as [[xenotime]]. Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of 7 [[isotope]]s, the most [[isotopic abundance|abundant]] of which is <sup>164</sup>Dy.

Dysprosium was first identified in 1886 by [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], but was not isolated in pure form until the development of [[ion exchange]] techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in [[nuclear reactor]]s, for its high [[magnetic susceptibility]] in data storage applications, and as a component of [[Terfenol-D]]. Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.

Dysprosium is a [[rare earth element]] that has a metallic, bright silver luster. It is soft enough to be cut with a knife, and can be machined without sparking if overheating is avoided. Dysprosium's physical characteristics can be greatly affected even by small amounts of impurities.<ref name="CRC">{{Cite book| editor = Lide, David R.| chapter = Dysprosium| year = 2007–2008| title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics| volume = 4| pages = 11| location = New York| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8493-0488-0}}</ref>

Dysprosium and [[holmium]] have the highest magnetic strengths of the elements,<ref name=nbb/> especially at low temperatures.<ref name="krebs"/> Dysprosium has a simple [[ferromagnetic]] ordering at temperatures below {{convert|85|K|C}}. Above {{convert|85|K|C}}, it turns into an helical [[antiferromagnetic]] state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular [[basal plane]] layer are parallel, and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers. This unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered ([[paramagnetic]]) state at {{convert|179|K|C}}.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = IRM Quarterly|year = 2000|volume = 10|issue = 3|page = 6|author = Jackson, Mike|publisher = Institute for Rock Magnetism|url =http://www.irm.umn.edu/quarterly/irmq10-3.pdf|title=Wherefore Gadolinium?

===Chemical properties===
Dysprosium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily to form [[dysprosium(III) oxide]]:
:4 Dy + 3 O<sub>2</sub> → 2 Dy<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>

Dysprosium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form dysprosium hydroxide:
:2 Dy (s) + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O (l) → 2 Dy(OH)<sub>3</sub> (aq) + 3 H<sub>2</sub> (g)

Dysprosium metal vigorously reacts with all the halogens at above 200&nbsp;°C:
:2 Dy (s) + 3 F<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2 DyF<sub>3</sub> (s) [green]
:2 Dy (s) + 3 Cl<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2 DyCl<sub>3</sub> (s) [white]
:2 Dy (s) + 3 Br<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2 DyBr<sub>3</sub> (s) [white]
:2 Dy (s) + 3 I<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2 DyI<sub>3</sub> (s) [green]

Dysprosium dissolves readily in dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form solutions containing the yellow Dy(III) ions, which exist as a [Dy(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>9</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> complexes:<ref>{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/dysprosium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Dysprosium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref>

:2 Dy (s) + 3 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (aq) → 2 Dy<sup>3+</sup> (aq) + 3 {{chem|SO|4|2-}} (aq) + 3 H<sub>2</sub> (g)

The resulting compound, dysprosium(III) sulfate, is noticeably paramagnetic.

Dysprosium halides, such as DyF<sub>3</sub> and DyBr<sub>3</sub>, tend to take on a yellow color. [[Dysprosium(III) oxide|Dysprosium oxide]], also known as dysprosia, is a white powder that is highly [[magnetic]], more so than iron oxide.<ref name="krebs"/>

Dysprosium combines with various non-metals at high temperatures to form binary compounds with varying composition and oxidation states +3 and sometimes +2, such as DyN, DyP, DyH<sub>2</sub> and DyH<sub>3</sub>; DyS, DyS<sub>2</sub>, Dy<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> and Dy<sub>5</sub>S<sub>7</sub>; DyB<sub>2</sub>, DyB<sub>4</sub>, DyB<sub>6</sub> and DyB<sub>12</sub>, as well as Dy<sub>3</sub>C and Dy<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub>.<ref name=patnaik/>

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of dysprosium}}
Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of 7 [[isotope]]s: <sup>156</sup>Dy, <sup>158</sup>Dy, <sup>160</sup>Dy, <sup>161</sup>Dy, <sup>162</sup>Dy, <sup>163</sup>Dy, and <sup>164</sup>Dy. These are all considered stable, although <sup>156</sup>Dy decays by [[alpha decay]] with a half-life of over 1×10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;years. Of the naturally occurring isotopes, <sup>164</sup>Dy is the most [[natural abundance|abundant]] at 28%, followed by <sup>162</sup>Dy at 26%. The least abundant is <sup>156</sup>Dy at 0.06%.<ref name="nubase">{{cite journal|title=Nubase2003 Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|pages=3–128|publisher=Atomic Mass Data Center|year=2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|author=Audi, G.|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A.H.}}</ref>

Twenty-nine [[radioisotopes]] have also been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 138 to 173. The most stable of these is <sup>154</sup>Dy with a [[half-life]] of approximately 3{{e|6}}&nbsp;years, followed by <sup>159</sup>Dy with a half-life of 144.4&nbsp;days. The least stable is <sup>138</sup>Dy with a half-life of 200&nbsp;ms. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by [[beta decay|β<sup>+</sup> decay]], while those that are heavier tend to decay by [[beta decay|β<sup>−</sup> decay]], with some exceptions. <sup>154</sup>Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and <sup>152</sup>Dy and <sup>159</sup>Dy decay primarily by [[electron capture]].<ref name="nubase"/> Dysprosium also has at least 11 [[metastable isomer]]s, ranging in atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is <sup>165m</sup>Dy, which has a half-life of 1.257&nbsp;minutes. <sup>149</sup>Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, <sup>149m2</sup>Dy, has a half-life of 28&nbsp;ns.<ref name="nubase"/>

==History==
In 1878, [[erbium]] ores were found to contain the oxides of [[holmium]] and [[thulium]]. French chemist [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], while working with [[holmium oxide]], separated dysprosium oxide from it in [[Paris]] in 1886.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Comptes Rendus|volume = 143|pages = 1003–1006|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3058f/f1001.chemindefer|title = L'holmine (ou terre X de M Soret) contient au moins deux radicaux métallique (Holminia contains at least two metal)|language = French|year = 1886|author = Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran}}</ref> His procedure for isolating the dysprosium involved dissolving dysprosium oxide in acid, then adding ammonia to precipitate the hydroxide. He was only able to isolate dysprosium from its oxide after more than 30 attempts at his procedure. Upon succeeding, he named the element ''dysprosium'' from the Greek ''dysprositos'' (δυσπρόσιτος), meaning "hard to get". However, the element was not isolated in relatively pure form until after the development of ion exchange techniques by [[Frank Spedding]] at [[Iowa State University]] in the early 1950s.<ref name=nbb>{{cite book|last = Emsley| first = John| title = Nature's Building Blocks| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2001| location = Oxford|url=http://books.google.com/?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&pg=PA131|pages = 129–132| isbn = 0-19-850341-5}}</ref>

In 1950, [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], [[Albert Ghiorso]], and Stanley G. Thompson bombarded <sup>241</sup>[[Americium|Am]] with helium ions, which produced atoms with an atomic number of 97 and which closely resembled the neighboring lanthanide [[terbium]]. Because terbium was named after [[Ytterby]], the city in which it and several other elements were discovered, this new element was named [[berkelium]] for the city in which it was synthesized. However, when the research team synthesized element 98, they could not think of a good analogy for dysprosium, and instead named the element [[californium]] in honor of the state in which it was synthesized. The research team went on to "point out that, in recognition of the fact that dysprosium is named on the basis of a Greek word meaning 'difficult to get at,' that the searchers for [[gold|another element]] a century ago found it difficult to [[California Gold Rush|get to California]]."<ref name="weeks">{{cite book| title = Discovery of the Elements|pages = 848–849|author = Weeks, M.

==Occurrence==
[[Image:Xenotímio1.jpeg|thumb|Xenotime]]
Dysprosium is never encountered as a free element, but is found in many [[mineral]]s, including [[xenotime]], [[fergusonite]], [[gadolinite]], [[euxenite]], [[polycrase]], [[blomstrandine]], [[monazite]] and [[bastnäsite]]; often with [[erbium]] and [[holmium]] or other rare earth elements. Currently, most dysprosium is being obtained from the ion-adsorption clay ores of southern China,<ref name="China rare">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/business/global/26rare.html |title=Earth-Friendly Elements, Mined Destructively |newspaper=The New York Times |last=Bradsher |first=Keith |date=December 25, 2009}}</ref> and future sources will include the Halls Creek region in Western Australia.<ref name="Australia rare">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rural/content/2011/s3377547.htm |title=Halls Creek turning into a hub for rare earths |last=Brann |first=Matt |date=November 27, 2011}}</ref> In the high-[[yttrium]] version of these, dysprosium happens to be the most abundant of the heavy [[lanthanide]]s, comprising up to 7–8% of the concentrate (as compared to about 65% for yttrium).<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Russian Journal of Non-Ferrous Metals|year = 2008|volume = 49|issue = 1|pages = 14–22|title = Review of the World Market of Rare-Earth Metals|first = A.

==Production==
Dysprosium is obtained primarily from [[monazite]] sand, a mixture of various [[phosphate]]s. The metal is obtained as a by-product in the commercial extraction of yttrium. In isolating dysprosium, most of the unwanted metals can be removed magnetically or by a [[flotation process]]. Dysprosium can then be separated from other rare earth metals by an [[ion exchange]] displacement process. The resulting dysprosium ions can then react with either [[fluorine]] or [[chlorine]] to form dysprosium fluoride, DyF<sub>3</sub>, or dysprosium chloride, DyCl<sub>3</sub>. These compounds can be reduced using either calcium or lithium metals in the following reactions:<ref name=heiserman>{{cite book|title=Exploring Chemical Elements and their Compounds|author = Heiserman, David L.|pages = 236–238|publisher = TAB Books|isbn = 0-8306-3018-X|year = 1992}}</ref>

:3 Ca + 2 DyF<sub>3</sub> → 2 Dy + 3 CaF<sub>2</sub>
:3 Li + DyCl<sub>3</sub> → Dy + 3 LiCl

The components are placed in a [[tantalum]] crucible and fired in a [[helium]] atmosphere. As the reaction progresses, the resulting halide compounds and molten dysprosium separate due to differences in density. When the mixture cools, the dysprosium can be cut away from the impurities.<ref name=heiserman/>

==Applications==
Dysprosium is used, in conjunction with [[vanadium]] and other elements, in making [[laser]] materials and commercial lighting.

Dysprosium is used in [[dosimeter]]s for measuring [[ionizing radiation]]. Crystals of [[calcium sulfate]] or [[calcium fluoride]] are doped with dysprosium. When these crystals are exposed to radiation, the dysprosium atoms become [[excited state|excited]] and [[luminescent]]. The luminescence can be measured to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected.<ref name=nbb/>

Nanofibers of dysprosium compounds have high strength and large surface area; therefore, they can be used for reinforcement of other materials and as a catalyst. Fibers of dysprosium oxide fluoride can be produced by heating an aqueous solution of DyBr<sub>3</sub> and NaF to 450&nbsp;°C at 450 bar pressure for 17 hours. This material is remarkably robust, surviving over 100 hours in various aqueous solutions at temperatures exceeding 400&nbsp;°C without re-dissolving or aggregating.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pnl.gov/supercriticalfluid/tech_oxidation.stm |title=Supercritical Water Oxidation/Synthesis|publisher=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory|accessdate=2009-06-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080420144601/http://www.pnl.gov/supercriticalfluid/tech_oxidation.stm |archivedate = 2008-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://availabletechnologies.pnl.gov/technology.asp?id=152|title=Rare Earth Oxide Fluoride: Ceramic Nano-particles via a Hydrothermal Method|publisher=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Unusual dysprosium ceramic nano-fiber growth in a supercritical aqueous solution| author= M.M.
