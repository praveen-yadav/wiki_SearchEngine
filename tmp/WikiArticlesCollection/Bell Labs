[[File:Volta Laboratory and Bureau nw22.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Alternatetext: An oblique view of a large salmon coloured two story stone building, of some prominence|Bell's 1893 Volta Bureau building in Washington, D.C.]] 

The [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory]], also variously known as the '''Volta Bureau''', the '''Bell Carriage House''', the '''Bell Laboratory''' and the '''Volta Laboratory''', was created in [[Washington, D.C.]] by [[Alexander Graham Bell]].

In 1880, the [[France|French government]] awarded Bell the [[Volta Prize]] of 50,000 francs (approximately US$10,000 at that time, about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1879|r=-4}}}} in current dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}) for the [[invention of the telephone]], which he used to found the Volta Laboratory, along with [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Sumner Tainter]] and Bell's cousin [[Chichester Bell]].<ref name="Bruce1990">Bruce, Robert V.

=== Early antecedent ===

In 1884 the [[American Bell Telephone Company]] created its Mechanical Department from the Electrical and Patent Department formed a year earlier.

=== Formal organization ===
In 1925 [[Western Electric]] Research Laboratories and part of the engineering department of the [[American Telephone & Telegraph]] company (AT&T) were consolidated to form Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., as a separate entity. The first president of research was [[Frank B. Jewett]], who stayed there until 1940. The ownership of Bell Laboratories was evenly split between AT&T and the Western Electric Company. Its principal work was to design and support the equipment that Western Electric built for [[Bell System]] operating companies, including [[telephone exchange|telephone exchange switch]]es. Support work for the phone companies included the writing and maintaining of the [[Bell System Practices]] (BSP), a comprehensive series of technical manuals. Bell Labs also carried out consulting work for the [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone Companies]], and U.S. government work, including [[Project Nike]] and the [[Apollo program]]. A few workers were assigned to basic research, and this attracted much attention, especially since they produced several [[Nobel Prize]] winners. Until the 1940s, the company's principal locations were in and around the [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|Bell Labs Building]] in [[New York City]], but many of these were moved to suburban areas of [[New Jersey]].

Among the later Bell Laboratories locations in New Jersey were [[Murray Hill, New Jersey|Murray Hill]], [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey|Holmdel]], [[Crawford Hill]], the [[Deal Test Site]], [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]], [[Lincroft, New Jersey|Lincroft]], [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]], [[Middletown Township, New Jersey|Middletown]], [[Neptune Township, New Jersey|Neptune]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[Piscataway, New Jersey|Piscataway]], [[Red Bank, New Jersey|Red Bank]], and [[Whippany, New Jersey|Whippany]]. Of these, Murray Hill and Crawford Hill remain in existence (the Piscataway and Red Bank locations were transferred to and are now operated by [[Telcordia Technologies]] and the Whippany site was purchased by [[Bayer]]<ref>{{cite web|title=It's official! Bayer buys Alcatel-Lucent site in Hanover Twp.|url=http://newjerseyhills.com/hanover_eagle/news/it-s-official-bayer-buys-alcatel-lucent-site-in-hanover/article_d32b1704-9fc7-11e1-8336-001a4bcf887a.html?mode=story|publisher=The Hanover Eagle|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref>). The largest grouping of people in the company was in [[Illinois]], at [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]]-[[Lisle, Illinois|Lisle]], in the [[Chicago]] area, which had the largest concentration of employees (about 11,000) prior to 2001. There also were groups of employees in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]; [[Columbus, Ohio]]; [[North Andover, Massachusetts]]; [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]; [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]; and [[Breinigsville, Pennsylvania]]; Burlington, North Carolina (1950sâ€“1970s, moved to Greensboro 1980s) and [[Westminster, Colorado]]. Since 2001, many of the former locations have been scaled down, or shut down entirely.
The [[Bell Labs Holmdel Complex|Holmdel site]], a 1.9 million square foot structure set on 473 acres, was shut down in 2007.  The mirrored-glass building was designed by [[Eero Saarinen]].  In August 2013, Somerset Development bought the building, intending to redevelop it into a mixed commercial and residential project. The prospects of success are clouded by the difficulty of readapting Saarinen's design and by the current glut of aging and abandoned office parks.<ref>>{{cite web|title=Future takes shape for Bell Labs site|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/realestate/commercial/future-takes-shape-for-bell-labs-site.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0&gwh=5E7B08AA3F6C8953AB163DA6FD824D78|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>

==Discoveries and developments==
[[File:Bell Laboratories logo.svg|thumb|right|Bell Laboratories logo, used from 1969 until 1983]]

At its peak, Bell Laboratories was the premier facility of its type, developing a wide range of revolutionary technologies, including [[radio astronomy]], the [[transistor]], the [[laser]], [[information theory]], the [[UNIX]] [[operating system]], the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and the [[C++|C++ programming language]]. Seven [[Nobel Prize]]s have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories.<ref>[http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/BellLabs/AwardsandRecognition#tabAnchor2 List of Awards]</ref>

* 1937: [[Clinton Davisson|Clinton J. Davisson]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for demonstrating the wave nature of matter.

* 1968: [[Richard Hamming]] for his work on numerical methods, automatic coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes.
* 1983: [[Ken Thompson]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]] for their work on operating systems theory, and their development of [[Unix]].

=== 1920s ===
During its first year of operation, facsimile ([[fax]]) transmission, invented elsewhere, was first demonstrated publicly by the Bell Laboratories.<!-- As a result of this research? --> In 1926, the laboratories invented an early example [[Sound film|synchronous-sound motion picture]] system, in competition with [[Movietone sound system|Fox Movietone]] and [[Phonofilm|DeForest Phonofilm]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9015241 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Article]</ref>

In 1924, Bell Labs physicist Dr. [[Walter A. Shewhart]] proposed the [[control chart]] as a method to determine when a process was in a state of statistical control. Shewart's methods were the basis for [[statistical process control]] (SPC)&nbsp;â€” the use of statistically based tools and techniques for the management and improvement of processes. This was the origin of the modern quality movement, including [[Six Sigma]].

In 1927, a Bell team headed by [[Herbert E. Ives]] successfully transmitted long-distance 128-line [[television]] images of [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]] from Washington to New York. In 1928 the [[thermal noise]] in a resistor was first measured by [[John B. Johnson]], and [[Harry Nyquist]] provided the theoretical analysis. (This is now referred to as "Johnson noise".) During the 1920s, the [[one-time pad]] [[cipher]] was invented by [[Gilbert Vernam]] and [[Joseph Mauborgne]] at the laboratories. Bell Labs' [[Claude Shannon]] later proved that it is unbreakable.

=== 1930s ===
[[File:Green Banks - Jansky Antena.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the directional antenna used in the discovery of radio emission of extraterrestrial origin by [[Karl Guthe Jansky]] at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in 1932.]]

In 1931, a foundation for [[radio astronomy]] was laid by [[Karl Jansky]] during his work investigating the origins of static on long-distance shortwave communications. He discovered that [[radio]] waves were being emitted from the center of the [[galaxy]].  In 1931 and 1932, experimental high fidelity, long playing, and even stereophonic recordings were made by the labs of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]].<ref>[http://www.stokowski.org/Harvey%20Fletcher%20Bell%20Labs%20Recordings.htm Leopold Stokowski, Dr. Harvey Fletcher, and the Bell Laboratories Experimental Recordings], stokowski.org. Retrieved 2012-03-01.</ref>  In 1933, [[Stereophonic sound|stereo signals]] were transmitted live from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] In 1937, the [[vocoder]], the first electronic [[speech synthesizer]] was invented and demonstrated by [[Homer Dudley]]. Bell researcher [[Clinton Davisson]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with [[George Paget Thomson]] for the discovery of [[electron diffraction]], which helped lay the foundation for [[solid-state electronics]].

=== 1940s ===
[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[transistor]], a [[point-contact transistor|point-contact]] [[germanium]] device, was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1947.  This image shows a replica.]]

In the early 1940s, the [[photovoltaic cell]] was developed by [[Russell Ohl]]. In 1943, Bell developed [[SIGSALY]], the first digital scrambled speech transmission system, used by the Allies in World War II. 

Bell Labs Quality Assurance Department gave the world and the United States such statisticians as [[Walter A. Shewhart]], [[W. Edwards Deming]], [[Harold F. Dodge]], [[George D. Edwards]], Harry Romig, R. L. Jones, Paul Olmstead, E.G.D. Paterson, and Mary N. Torrey. During World War II, Emergency Technical Committee - Quality Control, drawn mainly from Bell Labs' statisticians, was instrumental in advancing Army and Navy ammunition acceptance and material sampling procedures.

In 1947, the [[transistor]], probably the most important invention developed by Bell Laboratories, was invented by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[William Bradford Shockley]] (and who subsequently shared the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics in 1956). In 1947, [[Richard Hamming]] invented [[Hamming code]]s for [[error detection and correction]]. For patent reasons, the result was not published until 1950. In 1948, "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]", one of the founding works in [[information theory]], was published by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''. It built in part on earlier work in the field by Bell researchers [[Harry Nyquist]] and [[Ralph Hartley]], but it greatly extended these. Bell Labs also introduced a series of increasingly complex calculators through the decade. Shannon was also the founder of [[History of cryptography|modern cryptography]] with his 1949 paper ''[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]''.

==== Calculators ====
*Model I: A [[Complex Number Calculator]], completed January 1940, for doing calculations of [[complex numbers]]. See [[George Stibitz]].
*Model II: Relay Calculator or Relay Interpolator, September 1943, for aiming anti-aircraft guns
*Model III: Ballistic Computer, June 1944, for calculations of ballistic trajectories
*Model IV: Bell Laboratories Relay Calculator, March 1945, a second Ballistic Computer
*Model V: Bell Laboratories General Purpose Relay Calculator, of which two were built, July 1946 and February 1947, which were general-purpose programmable computers using electromechanical relays
*Model VI: November 1950, an enhanced Model V

=== 1950s ===
In 1952 [[William Gardner Pfann]] revealed the method of [[zone melting]] which enabled semiconductor purification and level doping.

The 1950s also saw developmental activity based upon information theory. The central development was binary code systems. Efforts concentrated more precisely on the Laboratories' prime mission of supporting the Bell System with engineering advances including N-carrier, TD [[Microwave radio relay]], [[Direct Distance Dialing]], E-[[repeaters]], [[Wire spring relay]]s, and [[5XB switch|improved switching]] systems. Maurice Karnaugh, in 1953, developed the [[Karnaugh map]] as a tool to facilitate management of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebraic]] expressions. In 1954, The first modern [[solar cell]] was invented at Bell Laboratories. As for the spectacular side of the business, in 1956 [[TAT-1]], the first [[transatlantic telephone cable]] was laid between Scotland and Newfoundland, in a joint effort by [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]], Bell Laboratories, and British and Canadian telephone companies.<!-- What was Bell Labs' involvement in that?--> A year later, in 1957, [[MUSIC-N|MUSIC]], one of the first computer programs to play [[electronic music]], was created by [[Max Mathews]]. New [[greedy algorithm]]s developed by [[Robert C. Prim]] and [[Joseph Kruskal]], revolutionized [[computer network]] design. In 1958, the [[laser]] was first described, in a technical paper by [[Arthur Schawlow]] and [[Charles Hard Townes]].

=== 1960s ===
In December 1960, [[Ali Javan]] and his associates [[William R. Bennett, Jr.|William Bennett]] and [[Donald Heriot]] successfully operated the first [[gas laser]], the first continuous-light laser, operating at an unprecedented accuracy and color purity. Also in 1960, [[Dawon Kahng]] and [[Martin Atalla]] invented the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor ([[MOSFET]]); the MOSFET has achieved electronic hegemony and sustains the [[Integrated circuit#LSI|large-scale integrated circuits]] (LSIs) underlying today's information society. In 1962, the [[electret microphone]] was invented by [[Gerhard Sessler|Gerhard M. Sessler]] and [[James Edward Maceo West]]. In 1964, the [[Carbon dioxide laser]] was invented by [[Kumar Patel]]. In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]], for which they were awarded the [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/ Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978]. Frank W. Sinden, Edward E. Zajac, Kenneth C. Knowlton, and A. Michael Noll made computer-animated movies during the early to mid-1960s. The first digital computer art was created in 1962 by Noll. In 1966, [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM), a key technology in wireless services, was developed and patented by R. W. Chang. In 1968, [[Molecular beam epitaxy]] was developed by [[J.R. Arthur]] and [[A.Y. Cho]]; molecular beam epitaxy allows semiconductor chips and laser matrices to be manufactured one atomic layer at a time. In 1969, the [[UNIX]] operating system was created by [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Ken Thompson (computer programmer)|Ken Thompson]]. From 1969 to 1971, [[Aaron Marcus]], the first graphic designer in the world to work with computer graphics, researched, designed, and programmed a prototype interactive page-layout system for the Picturephone (TM). The [[Charge-coupled device]] (CCD) was invented in 1969 by [[Willard Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]], for which they were awarded the [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/ Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009]. In the 1960s, the [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|New York City site]] was sold and became the [[Westbeth Artists Community]] complex.

=== 1970s ===
[[File:The C Programming Language 1st edition cover.jpg|left|thumb|The C programming language was developed at Bell Laboratories in 1972]]

The 1970s and 1980s saw more and more computer-related inventions at the Bell Laboratories as part of the [[personal computing]] revolution. In 1972 [[Dennis Ritchie]] developed the compiled [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] as a replacement for the interpretive [[B (programming language)|B]] which was then used in rewriting the [[Unix|UNIX]] operating system (also developed at Bell Laboratories by Ritchie and [[Ken Thompson]]).  Additionally, the [[AWK]] programming language was designed and implemented by [[Alfred Aho]], [[Peter Weinberger]], and [[Brian Kernighan]] of Bell Laboratories.

In 1970, [[A. Michael Noll]] patented a tactile, force-feedback system, coupled with interactive stereoscopic computer display. In 1971, an improved task priority system for computerized [[telephone exchange|switching system]]s for telephone traffic was invented by [[Erna Schneider Hoover]], who received one of the first [[software patent]]s for it. In 1976, [[Fiber optic]]s systems were first tested in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and in 1980, the first single-chip [[32-bit]] [[microprocessor]], the BELLMAC-32A was demonstrated. It went into production in 1982.

The 1970s also saw a major central office technology evolve from crossbar electromechanical relay-based technology and discrete transistor logic to Bell Labs-developed thick film hybrid and transistor-transistor logic (TTL), stored program-controlled switching systems; [[1ESS switch|1A]]/[[4ESS switch|#4 TOLL]] Electronic Switching Systems (ESS) and 2A Local Central Offices produced at the Bell Labs Naperville and Western Electric Lisle, Illinois facilities. This technology evolution dramatically reduced the floor space required. The new ESS also came with its own diagnostic software that required only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain. The technology was often touted in the Bell Labs Technical Journals and Western Electric magazine (WE People).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}<!-- Fact tag for the whole paragraph -->

=== 1980s ===
[[File:Bell Labs logo, 1984-1995.png|frame|Bell Laboratories logo, used from 1984 until 1995]]

In 1980, the [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] and [[CDMA]] digital cellular telephone technology was patented. In 1982, [[Fractional quantum Hall effect]] was discovered by [[Horst Ludwig StÃ¶rmer|Horst StÃ¶rmer]] and former Bell Laboratories researchers [[Robert B. Laughlin]] and [[Daniel C. Tsui]]; they consequently won a Nobel Prize in 1998 for the discovery. In 1986{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}, the [[C++]] programming language was developed by [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] as an extension to the original C programming language also developed at Bell Laboratories.

In 1984, the first photoconductive antennas for picosecond electromagnetic radiation were demonstrated by Auston and others. This type of antenna became an important component in [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]]. In 1984, the [[Karmarkar's algorithm|Karmarkar Linear Programming Algorithm]] was developed by mathematician [[Narendra Karmarkar]]. Also in 1984, [[Modification of Final Judgment|a divestiture agreement]] signed in 1982 with the American Federal government forced the break-up of AT&T: [[Bellcore]] (now [[Telcordia Technologies]]) was split off from Bell Laboratories to provide the same R&D functions for the newly created [[local exchange carrier]]s. [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] also was limited to using the Bell trademark only in association with Bell Laboratories. '''Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc.''' became a wholly owned company of the new [[AT&T Technologies]] unit, the former [[Western Electric]]. The [[5ESS Switch]] was developed during this transition. In 1985, [[laser cooling]] was used to slow and manipulate atoms by [[Steven Chu]] and team. In 1985, the [[AMPL|AMPL modeling language]] was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David M. Gay and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories.  Also in 1985, Bell Laboratories was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology]] "For contribution over decades to modern communication systems". During the 1980s, the [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9 operating system]] was developed as a replacement for [[Unix]] which was also developed at Bell Laboratories in 1969. Development of the [[Radiodrum]], a three dimensional electronic instrument<!-- vague statement! -->. In 1988, [[TAT-8]] became the first fiber optic transatlantic cable.

=== 1990s ===
[[Image:Lucent Technologies logo.svg|thumb|200px|Lucent Logo bearing the "Bell Labs Innovations" tagline]] 

In 1990, [[WaveLAN]], the first [[wireless]] [[local area network]] (WLAN) was developed at Bell Laboratories. In 1991, the 56K [[modem]] technology was patented by Nuri DaÄŸdeviren and his team. In 1994, the [[quantum cascade laser]] was invented by [[Federico Capasso]], [[Alfred Cho]], Jerome Faist and their collaborators and was later greatly improved by the innovations of [[Claire Gmachl]]. Also in 1994, [[Peter Shor]] devised his quantum factorization algorithm. In 1996, SCALPEL [[lithography|electron lithography]], which prints features atoms wide on microchips, was invented by Lloyd Harriott and his team. The [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno operating system]], an update of Plan 9, was created by Dennis Ritchie with others, using the new [[concurrent programming language|concurrent]] [[Limbo programming language]]. A high performance database engine (Dali) was developed which became DataBlitz in its product form.<ref>[http://www.bell-labs.com/project/dali/ Dali main-memory storage manager home page]</ref>

AT&T spun off Bell Laboratories, along with most of its equipment-manufacturing business, into a new company named [[Alcatel-Lucent|Lucent Technologies]]. AT&T retained a smaller number of researchers, who made up the staff of the newly created [[AT&T Labs]]. In 1997, the smallest practical transistor (60 [[nanometer]]s, 182 atoms wide) was built. In 1998, the first [[Optical IP Switching|optical router]] was invented {{Dubious|date=November 2009}}.

=== 2000s ===
[[Image:Alcatel Lucent Logo.svg|thumb|200px|Logo of Alcatel-Lucent, holding the Bell Labs now]] 

2000 was an active year for the Laboratories, in which [[DNA machine]] prototypes were developed; progressive geometry compression algorithm made widespread 3-D communication practical; the first electrically powered [[Dye laser|organic laser]] invented; a large-scale map of cosmic [[dark matter]] was compiled, and the F-15 (material), an organic material that makes plastic transistors possible, was invented. 

In 2002, physicist Jan Hendrik SchÃ¶n was [[SchÃ¶n scandal|fired]] after his work was found to contain fraudulent data. It was the first known case of fraud at Bell Labs.

In 2003, the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] Biomedical Engineering Laboratory was created at [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]].<ref>[http://www.njnano.org/resources/index.shtml New Jersey Nanotechnology Consortium. Profile]</ref>

In 2005, [[Jeong H. Kim|Dr. Jeong Kim]], former President of Lucent's Optical Network Group, returned from academia to become the President of Bell Laboratories.

In April 2006, Bell Laboratories' parent company, Lucent Technologies, signed a merger agreement with [[Alcatel]]. On December 1, 2006, the merged company, [[Alcatel-Lucent]], began operations. This deal raised concerns in the [[United States]], where Bell Laboratories works on defense contracts. A separate company, [http://www.lgsinnovations.com LGS Innovations], with an American board was set up to manage Bell Laboratories' and Lucent's sensitive [[U.S. Government]] contracts.

In December 2007, it was announced that the former Lucent Bell Laboratories and the former Alcatel Research and Innovation would be merged into one organization under the name of Bell Laboratories. This is the first period of growth following many years during which Bell Laboratories progressively lost manpower due to layoffs and spin-offs making the company shut down for a short period of time.

As of July 2008, however, only four scientists remained in physics research, according to a report by the scientific journal ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080820/full/454927a.html |title=Access : Bell Labs bottoms out : Nature News |publisher=Nature.com |author=Geoff Brumfiel |date= |accessdate=2008-09-14| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080907044552/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080820/full/454927a.html| archivedate= 7 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On August 28, 2008, Alcatel-Lucent announced it was pulling out of basic science, material physics, and semiconductor research, and it will instead focus on more immediately marketable areas, including networking, high-speed electronics, wireless networks, nanotechnology and software.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/08/bell-labs-kills.html |first=Priya |last=Ganapati |title=Bell Labs Kills Fundamental Physics Research |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2008-08-28 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080828233520/http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/08/bell-labs-kills.html| archivedate= 28 August 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 2009, Willard Boyle and George Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention and development of the charge-coupled device (CCD). <ref>[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/press.html Nobel Prize press release]</ref>
