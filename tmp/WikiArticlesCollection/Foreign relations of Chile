{{Main|Argentina–Chile relations}}
Chile and Argentina were close allies during the wars of independence against Spain. Argentine General [[José de San Martín]] crossed the Andes with Chilean independence hero [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] and together they defeated the Spaniards. However, after independence relations soured. This was primarily due to a border dispute: both nations claimed the totality of the [[Patagonia]] region.

Attempts to clear up the dispute were unsuccessful until 1881, when Chile was at war with both Bolivia and Peru. In order to avoid fighting Argentina as well, Chilean President [[Aníbal Pinto]] authorized his envoy, [[Diego Barros Arana]] to hand over as much territory as was needed to avoid Argentina siding with Bolivia and Peru. Barros succeeded in his mission: Argentina received the east Patagonia and Chile the Strait of Magellan. 

However, border disputes continued. In 1902, war was again avoided when British King [[Edward VII]] agreed to mediate between the two nations. He established the current border in the Patagonia region.

The [[Beagle conflict]] began to brew in the 1960s, when Argentina began to claim that the [[Beagle Channel cartography since 1881|Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] islands in the [[Beagle Channel]] were rightfully hers. In 1971 Chile and Argentina signed an agreement formally submitting the Beagle Channel issue to binding [[Beagle Channel Arbitration]]. On May 2, 1977 the court ruled that the islands and all adjacent formations belonged to Chile. See the [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration].

On 25 January 1978, the Argentina military junta led by General [[Jorge Videla]] declared the award fundamentally null and intensified their claim over the islands. On 22. December 1978, Argentina started<ref>See Argentine newspaper [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00401e.htm Clarín] of Buenos Aires, 20 December 1998</ref> the [[Operation Soberanía]] over the disputed islands, but the invasion was halted due to:<ref>See Alejandro Luis Corbacho ''"Predicting the probability of war during brinkmanship crisis: The Beagle and the Malvinas conflicts"'' http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1016843 (p.45)</ref>
: ''The newspaper Clarín explained some years later that such caution was based, in part, on military concerns. In order to achieve a victory, certain objectives had to be reached before the seventh day after the attack. Some military leaders considered this not enough time due to the difficulty involved in transportation through the passes over the Andean Mountains.''
and in cite 46:
: ''According to Clarín, two consequences were feared. First, those who were dubious feared a possible regionalization of the conflict. Second, as a consequence, the conflict could acquire great power proportions. In the first case decisionmakers speculated that Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Brazil might intervene. Then the great powers could take sides. In this case, the resolution of the conflict would depend not on the combatants, but on the countries that supplied the weapons.''

In December that year, moments before Videla signed a declaration of war against Chile, [[Pope John Paul II]] agreed to mediate between the two nations. The Pope's envoy, [[Antonio Samorè]], successfully averted war and proposed a new definitive boundary in which the three disputed islands would remain Chilean.  Chile immediately accepted this decision, but Argentina still disliked and avoided acceptance until after the lost [[Falklands War]] in 1982. Both agreed to Samoré's proposal and signed the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]], ending that dispute.

In the 1990s, under presidents [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle|Frei]] and [[Carlos Menem|Menem]] both countries solved almost all of the remaining border disputes during bilateral talks. They also agreed to submit [[Laguna del Desierto]] to international arbitration in 1994. Almost the entire disputed area was awarded to Argentina. 

The last border dispute are {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}. in the [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]] from [[Mount Fitz Roy]] to [[Mount Daudet]] that is still officially undefined.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.difrol.cl/acuerdo_de_hielos.htm 1998 | title= Border agreement between Chile and Argentina| accessdate=2006-10-21|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070117021516/http%3A//www.difrol.cl/acuerdo_de_hielos.htm |archivedate = January 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.turistel.cl/v2/secciones/mapas/informacion/ruteros/aisen.htm  | title=Map showing border between Chile and Argentina (partly undefined) | accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref> In August 2006, however, a tourist map was published in Argentina placing the disputed region within the borders of that country. Chile filed an official complaint, sparking renewed efforts to settle the dispute which the Argentine government supports and urged Chile to finish quick as possible the demarcation of the international border.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/08/30/um/m-01262333.htm Tras la fricción por los Hielos Continentales, la Argentina llama a Chile a demarcar los límites "lo antes posible"]</ref>

Since democratization in the 1980s, both countries began a close economic and political integration as Chile became an associated member of [[Mercosur]]. Also both countries practice defense cooperation and friendship policy.

==={{Flag|Bolivia}}===
{{Main|Bolivia–Chile relations}}
Relations with [[Bolivia]] have been strained ever since the independence wars because of the [[Atacama border dispute]] (Bolivia claims a corridor to the Pacific Ocean). The Spaniards never bothered to definitely establish a border between Chile and Bolivia. Chile claimed its limit with Peru ran through the Loa River and that Bolivia was therefore landlocked, while Bolivia claimed it did have a coast and that the limit with Chile ran along the Salado River. The border remained vague throughout the 19th century. Finally, Bolivia and Chile agreed, in 1866, to allow Bolivia access to the Pacific and that the limit of the two countries would run along the 24th parallel. The area between the 25th and 23rd parallel would remain demilitarized and both nations would be allowed to mine there. It was also agreed that taxes on the exportation of [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] would not increase.

However, in 1879, Bolivian dictator General [[Hilarión Daza]] increased the taxes on the exportation of saltpeter, violating the 1866 treaty. When Chilean-owned saltpeter companies protested, Daza expropriated their companies and sold them in a [[public auction]]. Daza then put an end to all commerce with Chile and exiled all Chilean residents in Bolivia (the Bolivian port of [[Antofagasta]] had more Chileans than Bolivians). In response, Chile declared war on Bolivia and occupied Bolivia's coast. Peru had, in 1873, signed a secret pact with Bolivia in which the two countries agreed to fight together against any nation that threatened either of them. When Peru refused to be neutral in the conflict between Chile and Bolivia, Chile declared war on Peru. Chile defeated both countries and annexed the coast claimed by Bolivia. This was ratified in a 1904 treaty.  

Diplomatic relations with Bolivia continued to be strained because of Bolivia's continuing aspiration to the sea.  In 1964, Bolivian President [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]] severed diplomatic relations with Chile.  Generals [[Augusto Pinochet]] and [[Hugo Banzer]] resumed diplomatic relations and attempted to settle territorial disputes.  The secret negotiations started in 1973 and in 1975 diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia were established.  That year, both dictators met in the Bolivian border town of Charaña.  Pinochet agreed to give Bolivia a small strip of land running between the Chilean city of [[Arica]] and the [[Peru]]vian border.  However the Treaty of Lima between Peru and Chile specified that Chile must consult Peru before granting any land to a third party in the area of [[Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá]].  Peruvian dictator General  [[Francisco Morales Bermúdez]] did not agree with the Charaña proposal and instead drafted his own proposal, in which the three nations would share administration of the port of Arica and the sea immediately in front of it.  Pinochet refused this agreement, and Banzer broke ties with Chile again in 1978.  The failure of the Charaña accords was one of the reasons of Banzer's downfall that very year. 

Chile and Bolivia maintain consular relations, and appear to have become friendlier. Former Chilean President [[Ricardo Lagos]] attended the inauguration of current Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]]. Morales has repeatedly announced his intention to establish diplomatic relations with Chile once more, but has still not given up Bolivia's claim to the sea.

==={{Flag|Brazil}}===
{{Main|Brazil–Chile relations}}

Chile and Brazil have acted numerous times as mediators in international conflicts, such as in the [[Veracruz Incident|1914 diplomatic impasse]] between the United States and Mexico, avoiding a possible [[war|state of war]] between those two countries. More recently, since the [[2004 Haitian coup d'état]], Chile and Brazil have activelly participated in the [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti]], which is led by the [[Brazilian Army]]. They are also two of the three most important economies in South America along with [[Argentina]].

On May 20, 1914, Chile and the other [[ABC Powers]] met in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], Canada, to mediate diplomatically to avoid a [[war|state of war]] between the United States and Mexico over the [[Veracruz Incident]] and the [[Tampico Affair]]. In 1974, Mexico severed diplomatic relations over the overthrow of President Salvador Allende. For the next fifteen years, Mexico would accept thousands of Chilean refugees who were escaping the government of General Augusto Pinochet. Diplomatic relations between the two nations were re-established in 1990. Currently both countries have signed a [[Chile–Mexico Free Trade Agreement|free trade agreement]] that went into effect in 1999.<ref>[http://www.aduana.cl/prontus_aduana_eng/site/artic/20070227/pags/20070227171042.html Free Trade Agreement Chile - Mexico]</ref> Both nations are founding members of the [[Pacific Alliance]] and are the only two Latin-American nations to be members of the [[OECD]].

==={{Flag|Peru}}===
{{Main|Chile–Peru relations}}
Chile and Peru had excellent relations at the time of independence, when Chilean independence hero [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] formed the [[Freedom Expedition of Perú]], financed by the Chilean government for the cause of the liberation of the northern neighbour. Chile and Peru participated in a common conflict against Spain, the [[Chincha Islands War]] (1864–1866), despite their causes for war with Spain where different. Despite the Chilean port of [[Valparaíso]] was bombed and mostly destroyed by Spain during the conflict, the combined Peru-Chile fleet managed to defend Chilean territory near Abtao, and the Peruvian defenders of Callao managed to drive back the Spanish attack. In 1873, Peru signed a secret defensive pact with Bolivia in which it agreed to help that nation in case of foreign attack. The moment came in 1879, when Chile declared war on Bolivia. Peru refused to null its defensive pact with Bolivia, and Chile declared war on Peru. The [[War of the Pacific]], as the conflict was called, resulted in a decisive victory for Chile, which managed to reach Lima and occupied Peru for a few years.

In 1883, Chile and Peru signed the Treaty of Ancón in which Peru handed over the Province of [[Tarapacá Province (Peru)|Tarapacá]]. Peru also had to hand over the departments of [[Arica]] and [[Tacna]]. These would remain under Chilean control until a later date, when there would be a plebiscite to decide which nation would maintain control over Arica and Tacna. Chile and Peru, however, were unable to agree on how or when to hold the plebiscite, and in 1929, both countries signed the Treaty of Lima, in which Peru gained Tacna and Chile maintained control of Arica.

Relations have remained sour because of the war. In 1975, both countries were at the brink of war, only a few years before the centennial of the War of the Pacific. The conflict was fueled by ideological disputes: Peruvian General [[Juan Velasco]] was a left-winger while Chilean General [[Augusto Pinochet]] was a right-winger. Velasco,  backed by [[Cuba]], set the date for invasion on August 6, the 150th independence anniversary of Bolivia, and the proposed date when Chile intended to grant this country with a sovereign corridor north of Arica, in former Peruvian territory, transfer not approved by Peru. However, he was successfully dissuaded from starting the invasion on that date by his advisor, General [[Francisco Morales Bermúdez]], whose original family was from the former Peruvian (currently Chilean) region of Tarapacá. Velasco later fell ill and was deposed by a group of generals who proclaimed Morales Bermúdez president on August 28.

Morales Bermúdez assured the Chilean government that Peru had no plans for an invasion despite its tremendous military superiority.  Tensions mounted again when a Chilean spy mission in Peru was discovered. Morales Bermúdez was again able to avert war, despite pressure from Velasco's ultranationalist followers. 

Relations between the two nations have since mostly recovered.  In 2005, the Peruvian Congress unilaterally approved a new law which stated the sea limit with Chile.  Peru's position was that the border has never been fully demarcated, but Chile disagreed reminding on treaties in 1952 and 1954 between the countries, which supposedly defined seaborder. The border problem has still not been solved. However, former Chilean president [[Michelle Bachelet]] and Peru's [[Alan García]] established a positive diplomatic relationship, and it is very unlikely any hostilities will break out because of the dispute.

Nevertheless, in early April 2007, Peruvian nationalistic sectors, mainly represented by left wing ex-presidential candidate [[Ollanta Humala]] decided to congregate at 'hito uno' right at the border with Chile, in a symbolic attempt to claim sovereignty over a maritime area known in Peru as [[Mar de Grau]] (Grau's Sea) just west of the Chilean city of [[Arica]]. Peruvian police stopped a group of nearly 2,000 people just ten kilometers from the border, preventing them from reaching their intended destination. Despite these incidents, the presidents of both Chile and Peru have confirmed their intentions to improve the relationships between the two countries, mainly fueled by the huge amount of commercial exchange between both countries private sectors.

The strongly anti-Communist military government in Chile maintained friendly ties with the Communist government in China for the remainder of the Cold War, with Pinochet crediting the Chinese for abiding by the principle of non-interference in other nations' internal affairs.<ref>"Chile's Right-Wing President Welcomes a Chinese Official."  _The New York Times_, June 16, 1987, page A5.</ref>  China and Chile exchanged military missionsand the Soviet Chilean copper exports to China and Chinese loans The friendly relations were cemented by a share distaste for the Soviet Union, the Chinese diplomatic principle of non-interference in other nations' internal affairs, and a willingness to overlook ideological differences in the pursuit of economic ties.<ref>Sulzberger, C. L. "Chile and the Coldest War."  _The New York Times_, November 29, 1975, page 27.</ref>
