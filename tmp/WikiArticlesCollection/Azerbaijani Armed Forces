The '''Azerbaijani Armed Forces''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Silahlı Qüvvələri}}) were re-established according to the Law of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] on the Armed Forces from 9 October 1991.<ref>[http://www.president.az official web page of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan]</ref> The [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR) had originally formed its own armed forces from 26 June 1918.  However these were dissolved after Azerbaijan was absorbed into the Soviet Union as the  [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] from 28 April 1920. After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991-92 the armed forces were reformed based on Soviet bases and equipment left on Azeri soil.

The armed forces have three branches: the [[Azerbaijani Land Forces]], the [[Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force]], and the [[Azerbaijani Navy]].<ref name=JSSA-MT /> Associated forces include the [[Azerbaijani National Guard]], the [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]], and the [[State Border Service (Azerbaijan)|State Border Service]], which can be involved in state defense under certain circumstances.

According to the Azerbaijani media sources the military expenditures of Azerbaijan for 2009 were set at $2.46 billion [[United States dollar|USD]],<ref>{{cite news |title= Gov`t allots over $2bn for 2009 defense spending |url= http://www.azernews.az/site/shownews.php?news_id=8601 |publisher= AzerNEWS |first= |last= |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate= 2008-11-12}}</ref> however according to [[SIPRI]], only $1.473 billion was spent in that year.<ref name="SIPRI">[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] [http://milexdata.sipri.org The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database]</ref> [[IISS]] also suggests that the defence budget in 2009 was $1.5 billion.<ref name="IISS 2010"/> Azerbaijan has its own [[Azerbaijan Defense Industry|Defense Industry]], which manufactures small arms.

==Overview==
Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Azerbaijan has been trying to further develop its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. Azerbaijan has been undergoing extensive modernization and capacity expanding programs, with the military budget increasing from around $300 million in 2005 to $2.46 billion in 2009.<ref name="reuters.com">{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL1597375 | work=Reuters | title=Azerbaijan announces 53 pct rise in army spending | date=15 April 2008}}</ref> The total armed forces number 56,840 men in the land forces, 7,900 men in the air force and air defence force, and 2,200 men in the navy.<ref name="IISS 2010"/> There are also 19,500 personnel in the National Guard, State Border Service, and Internal Troops.<ref name=Blandy12>C.

Azerbaijan has acceded to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] as a non-[[List of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]]. Azerbaijan participates in [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]]. Azerbaijan joined the [[U.S.-led coalition against Iraq]] in 2003. It sent 150 troops to Iraq, and later troops to Kosovo. Azeri troops are still serving in Afghanistan.

Despite the rise in Azerbaijan's defence budget, which now doubles Armenia's entire state budget,<ref>Blandy, 'Azerbaijan: Is War Over Nagornyy Karabakh a Realistic Option?, 2008, p.6, quoting http://nvo.ng.ru/wars/2007-02-09/2_poroh.html Nezavisimoye Voyennoye Obozreniye 9 February 2007.</ref> the armed forces were assessed in 2008 as not having a high state of battle readiness and being ill-prepared for wide scale combat operations.<ref name="Blandy, 2008, p.7">Blandy, 2008, p.7</ref>

Today '[[National Hero of Azerbaijan]]' is the highest national title in the country, awarded for outstanding services of national importance to Azerbaijan in defense, as well as other deeds in other spheres.

==History of the Azerbaijani military==
{{Main|Military history of Azerbaijan}}

===Azerbaijan Democratic Republic===
[[File:Mehmandarov.jpg|thumb|125px|left|[[Samad bey Mehmandarov]], the Minister of Defense of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]]]
The history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1918, when the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan Republic were created on June 26, 1918. First ''de facto'' Minister of Defense of ADR was Dr. [[Khosrov bey Sultanov]]. When the Ministry was formally established Gen. [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]] became the minister, and then Lt-Gen. [[Ali-Agha Shikhlinski]] his deputy. Chiefs of Staff of ADR Army were Lt-Gen. Mamedbey Sulkevich (March 1919 - 10 December 1919) and Maj-Gen. Abdulhamid bey Gaitabashi (10 December 1919 – April 1920).<ref name="Azerbaijani Army marks 91 years">[http://en.apa.az/print.php?id=104326 Azerbaijani Army marks 91 years]</ref><ref>[http://www.today.az/news/politics/53397.html Today.Az - Azerbaijan marks Day of Armed Forces]</ref>

The [[Red Army]] invaded Azerbaijan on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an [[Armenia]]n revolt that had just broken out in [[Karabakh]], the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918-20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 of the total 30,000 soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.<ref>

[[File:Parade of the Army of Islam in Baku.jpg|thumb|250px|Parade of the ottoman [[Army of Islam (Ottoman Empire)|army of Islam]] in 1919 to the victory in [[Battle of Baku]]]]

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union. Much of the Soviet Union's oil on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] was supplied by Baku. By a decree of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan was recognised with orders and medals.
[[Operation Edelweiss]] carried out by the German [[Wehrmacht]] targeted [[Baku]] because of the importance of its oil fields to the USSR.<ref>Swietochowski, Tadeusz(1995) ''Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition, Columbia University'', p. 133.</ref>
Some 800,000 Azerbaijanis fought within the ranks of the Soviet Army of which 400,000 died. Azeri national formations of the [[Red Army]] included the 223rd, 227th, 396th, 402nd, and 416th Rifle Divisions. Azeri Major-General [[Hazi Aslanov]] was awarded twice Hero of the Soviet Union.

===Dissolution of the Soviet armed forces===
During the Cold War, Azerbaijan had been the deployment area of units of the Soviet [[4th Army (Soviet Union)|4th Army]] whose principle formations included three motor rifle divisions (23rd, 60th, and 296th).  The 4th Army also included missile and air defense brigades and artillery and rocket regiments. The 75th Motor Rifle Division, part of the [[7th Guards Army]], was isolated in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]]. The 75th Division's stores and equipment were apparently transferred to the Nakhichevan authorities.<ref>See reference at [[7th Guards Army]] article.</ref> Azerbaijan also hosted the 49th Arsenal of the Soviet [[Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation|Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery]], which contained over 7,000 train-car loads of ammunition to the excess of one billion units.

The first president of Azerbaijan, [[Ayaz Mutallibov]], did not wish to build an independent army, wanting to rely instead largely on Soviet troops. Even when the Parliament decided that an army should be formed in September 1991, disagreements between the government and the opposition [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]] impeded creation of a unified force.<ref>International Crisis Group, Azerbaijan: Defence Sector Management and Reform Crisis Group Europe Briefing N°50, 29 October 2008, p.3</ref> Around this time, the first unit of the new army was formed on the basis of the 18-110 military unit of [[mechanized infantry]] of the [[Soviet Ground Forces]] (probably part of the [[4th Army (Soviet Union)|4th Army]]) located in [[Shikhov]], south of Baku.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://dejure.az/index.php/cra-hakimiyyti/70-nazirliklr/99-azrbaycan-respublikas-muedafi-nazirliyi | title= Azərbaycan Respublikası Müdafiə Nazirliyi. 1991-dən sonra | trans_title= Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan Republic.

In summer 1992, the nascent Defense Ministry received a resolution by the Azerbaijani president on the takeover of units and formations in Azerbaijani territory. It then forwarded an ultimatum to Moscow demanding control over vehicles and armaments of the 135th and 139th Motor Rifle Regiments of the 295th Motor Rifle Division.<ref>Vladimir Petrov, [http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/4-2002/dp/hscwa/?form=print How South Caucasus was armed], Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (Moscow, Russia)</ref> In July 1992, Azerbaijan ratified the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] (CFE), which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment. Azerbaijan approved the CFE flank agreement in May 1997.

The transfer of the property of the 4th Army (except for part of the property of the 366th Motor Rifle Regiment of the [[8th Cavalry Corps (Soviet Union)#Postwar|23rd Motor Rifle Division]] captured by Armenian armed formations in 1992 during the regiment's withdrawal from Stepanakert) and the 49th arsenal was completed in 1992. Thus, by the end of 1992, Azerbaijan received arms and military hardware sufficient for approximately four motor rifle divisions with prescribed army units. It also inherited naval ships. There are also reports that 50 combat aircraft from the disbanded [[Baku Air Defence Army|19th Army]] of the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]] came under Azeri control.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
After Lt Gen Barshadli became Chief of General Staff, [[Minister_of_Defense_(Azerbaijan)#Ministers_of_Defense_of_Azerbaijan_Republic|subsequent defense ministers from 1992]] have included:

* Maj.-Gen. [[Tajeddin Mehdiyev]] (December 1991 - January 1992)
* Colonel [[Shahin Musayev]] (January–February 1992)
* Interior Troops Colonel [[Tahir Aliyev]] (February–March 1992)
* [[Rahim Gaziyev]] (March 1992-February 1993)
* Maj.-Gen. [[Dadash Rzayev]] (February–June 1993)
* Colonel [[Zakir Hasanov]] (June–August 1993)
* Maj.-Gen. [[Vahid Musayev]] (August–September 1993)
* Maj. Gen. [[Mammadrafi Mammadov]] (September 1993 - February 1995)
* Col.-Gen. [[Safar Abiyev]] (since 1995)

The Azeri armed forces took a series of devastating defeats by Armenian forces<ref>[http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm 1993 UN Security Council Resolutions on Nagorno-Karabakh]</ref> during the 1992–1994 [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], which resulted in the loss of control of Nagorno-Karabakh proper and seven surrounding [[rayon]]s, comprising roughly 16%<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html CIA World Factbook. Azerbaijan. 2008:"''Azerbaijan has lost 16% of its territory and must support some 600,000 internally displaced persons as a result of the conflict.''"]</ref> of the territory of [[Azerbaijan]]. Azerbaijani sources insist that Armenian victory was largely due to military help from [[Russia]] and the wealthy [[Armenian diaspora]]. Armenians partially deny the allegation, claiming that Russian side was equally supplying Armenian and Azerbaijani sides with weapons and mercenaries. During the war, the Azeri armed forces were also aided by Turkish military advisers, and Russian, Ukrainian, Chechen and Afghan mercenaries.

===Non-combat deaths===
A number of Azerbaijani human rights groups have been tracking non-combat deaths and have noted an upward trend. Based on Defense Ministry statistics that had not been released to the public, the Group of Monitoring Compliance with Human Rights in the Army (GMCHRA) has recorded the deaths of 76 soldiers to date in non-combat incidents for 2011, and the injury of 91 others. In comparison, there were 62 non-combat deaths and 71 cases of injury in 2010.  The string of non-combat deaths raises questions about the reform progress of the military.  Factors behind the deaths include bullying, hazing, and the systemic corruption within the Azeri military.<ref>{{cite news |title=Azerbaijan: Non-Combat Deaths Put Military Reforms in Spotlight| url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/64508 | publisher=EurasiaNet |date=2011-11-14 | accessdate=2012-02-02}}</ref>

==Land forces==
[[File:RSZO Smertch.jpg|right|thumb|Azerbaijan has a dozen 300mm salvo rocket systems 9A52 “Smerch” with a range of 70-{{convert|90|km|2|abbr=on}}.]]
The [[Azerbaijani Land Forces]] number 85,000 strong, according to UK [[Advanced Research and Assessment Group]] estimates.<ref name=Blandy12 /> The 2,500 men of the National Guard are also part of the ground forces. In addition, there are 300,000 former service personnel who have had military service in the last 15 years.<ref name="IISS157"/> Other paramilitary agencies consist of Interior Ministry [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]], 12,000 strong, and the land component of the [[State Border Service (Azerbaijan)|State Border Service]], 5,000 strong.<ref name=Blandy12 />

Azerbaijan has signed numerous contracts to strengthen its armed forces and to train its military with Turkey's assistance. Over the last 15 years, Azerbaijan has been preparing its military for possible action against Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.

===Organization===
[[File:Azerbaijan Army 2007 OrBat.png|thumb|[[Azerbaijani Army]] Order of Battle]]
The Land Forces consist of five army corps:<ref name=Blandy12 />
*1st Army Corps also known as Evlax Army Corps (concentrated near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]])
*2nd Army Corps also known as Pirekeshkul Army Corps (concentrated against Armenian controlled territories and part is deployed on the [[Azerbaijan]]-[[Iran]]ian border)
*3rd Army Corps also known as Shamkir Army Corps (concentrated against Armenian controlled territories)
*4th Army Corps also known as Baku Army Corps (covers [[Absheron Peninsula]] and the coast)
*5th Army Corps also known as Nakhchivan Army Corps (deployed in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]])

The Land Forces include 23 motor rifle brigades, an artillery brigade, a multiple rocket launcher brigade, and an anti-tank regiment.<ref name=Blandy12 /> The IISS Military Balance reported in 2007 that the Land Forces had an estimated 40 SA-13 Gopher, SA-4 Ganef, and SA-8 Gecko air defence missile systems, with '80-240 eff.' to support the army in the battlefield. (IISS 2007, p.&nbsp;157)

The [[Peacekeeping forces of Azerbaijan]] are mostly supplied from the Land Forces, though the [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]] do also supply some. As of March 2011, 94 peacekeepers were deployed with the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) in Afghanistan.<ref>http://www.isaf.nato.int/images/stories/File/Placemats/PLACEMAT.MARCH%2004..pdf</ref> In the past, it also actively supported the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo and Iraq.

The Azeri [[Peacekeeping forces of Azerbaijan|peacekeeping unit]] deployed in Iraq consisted of 14 officers, 16 sergeants and 120 privates, a total of 150 troops. The unit secured the [[hydroelectric power station]] and reservoir in [[Haditha, Iraq|Al Haditha]] from August 2003. In December 2008, Azerbaijan withdrew the unit from Iraq.

==Air forces==
The [[Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force]] is a single unified service branch.<ref name=JSSA-MT>Jane's Sentinel Security Assessments - Russia and the CIS: Air Force, dated 18 June 2009, and {{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |month= |title=World Defence Almanac  |journal=Military Technology |volume= XXXII |issue= 1 |pages=244–245|publisher=Monch Publishing Group |location=Bonn, Germany |issn=0722-3226}}</ref> Some 8,000 men serve in the air force and air defence force.<ref name=Blandy12 />

The Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force has around 106 aircraft and 35 helicopters.<ref name=IISS158 /> The country has four major airbases. [[Nasosnaya Air Base]] has fighters, [[Kyurdamir Air Base]] a bomber regiment, [[Ganja Air Base]] transports, and [[Baku Kala Air Base]] the helicopter unit. There are also four other airbases which do not appear to have aircraft based there. These are [[Dollyar Air Base]], [[Nakhichevan Airport]], [[Sanqacal]] Air Base, and [[Sitalcay]] Air Base.

The Azeri Air Force uses [[MiG-21]], [[MiG-23]], [[Su-24]] and [[Su-25]] aircraft, as well as the [[MiG-29]] purchased from [[Ukraine]] in 2006 and [[Il-76]] transport aircraft. The MiG-29 have been designated as the standard aircraft for the AzAF.<ref>[http://www.today.az/news/politics/38475.html Azerbaijan shows 4th generation MiG-29 multirole fighter jets.]</ref> Azerbaijan is holding talks with either the People's Republic of [[China]] or [[Pakistan]] to purchase [[JF-17]] Thunder aircraft.<ref>[http://news.am/en/news/8954.html China supplies FC-1 multipurpose fighters to Azerbaijan]</ref> [[MiG-25]]s previously in service have been retired seemingly in the 2007-09 period.

Azerbaijan's helicopter force is concentrated at [[Baku Kala Air Base]] and according to the IISS consists of a single regiment with around 14-15 Mi-24, 12-13 Mi-8 and 7 Mi-2. [[Jane's Information Group]] and the IISS give figures which agree with only a single aircraft's difference.<ref>http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/sng/azerb/azerb.htm</ref> Recently, end of 2010 Russian Rosvertol announced that Azerbaijan armed forces signed a deal for 24 pieces of Mi-35M (Hind-E) gunships what would further enhance the Azeri ground attack formations.<ref>http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Azerbaijan-Orders-24-Mi-35M-Helicopter-Gunships-06789/</ref><ref>http://www.helihub.com/2011/02/25/azerbaijan-buys-24-mi-35m-attack-helicopters/</ref>

The Air Force has [[Aero L-29 Delfín|L-29]] and [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39]] advanced training aircraft in store. The [[Azerbaijan Border Guard]] and Voluntary Society of Defense, Patriotism and Sport have [[Yakovlev]] light training aircraft.

===Air defense===
[[File:Military parade in Baku on an Army Day32.jpg|thumb|S-300 PMU2 during a military parade in Baku 2011.]]
Azerbaijan has missile and radar systems intended to defend Azeri airspace. There are at least 2 divisions of [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]]PMU2.<ref name="azers300">[http://www.historyoftruth.com/news/latest/7654-russian-defense-ministry-confirms-readiness-to-sell-s-300-to-azerbaijan Russian Defense Ministry Confirms Readiness to Sell S-300 to Azerbaijan.]</ref> Thereby the country has one of the most capable SAM [surface-to-air missile] system in the region.<ref name="IMINT & Analysis">[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B8JEdtKWzL0WNjcyOTMzMGQtNjgxNi00NTgwLThkNTEtODcxY2NkOGJhNWM1&hl=en_US IMINT & Analysis]</ref><ref name="eurasianet s300">[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/64085 Russia's Credibility And Its Military Sales To Azerbaijan]</ref> Azerbaijan also operates two S-200 (SA-5 GAMMON) batteries near Baku and Mingachevir; the S-300PMU-2 represents a logical replacement for these systems offering coverage of the majority of the nation.<ref name="eurasianet s300" /> The country also has about 100 NATO designated [[SA-2]] Guideline (original name S-75), [[SA-3 Goa]] (S-125 Pechora-2M), and the [[S-200 Angara/Vega/Dubna|SA-5 Gammon]] (S-200) are in static installations.<ref>[[IISS]] Military Balance 2007, p.&nbsp;158</ref> These may be around Baku and the central part to cover the whole Azeri aerospace. 
 
However, August 2011 investigations shows that after purchase of [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] [[surface to air missile]]s, the largest apparent gap in Azerbaijan's air defense system may have been filled.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kuchera|first=Joshua|title=Analysis: Azerbaijan, Karabakh Well-Protected Against Air Attack; Armenia Less So|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/63989|publisher=Eurasia.net|accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref>

Also in Azerbaijan there is a former Soviet early warning radar. The [[Qabala Radar]] is a bistatic phased-array installation, currently operated by the [[Russian Space Forces]] under a contract until 2012. The contract was signed in 2002 and will expire in 2012 where it would be given back to the Azerbaijani government. The contract costs Russia $7 million per year. The radar station has a range of up to 6,000&nbsp;kilometres (3,728&nbsp;mi), and was designed to detect [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] launches as far as from the [[Indian Ocean]]. Whether the Russian Government shares any of the station's radar data with Azerbaijan is unknown.

===Training and education===
Azerbaijani pilots are trained in the Azerbaijan Air Force School and then developing their skills in operational units. Azerbaijan has an experience exchange with Turkey, Ukraine, the United States and a number of NATO countries. The Turkish Air Force School has a great role in the training of Azeri military pilots. Azerbaijani pilots are also trained in Ukraine’s Pilot Training School.<ref>[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=97127 Azerbaijan’s military aviation opportunities]</ref>

==Navy==
The main naval base of the Soviet Union in the Caspian Sea was based in Baku. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Azerbaijan inherited the naval base and parts of the Caspian Fleet.<ref name="nvo.ng">{{cite web|url=http://nvo.ng.ru/forces/2007-08-31/3_nato.html|title=В фарватере НАТО |author=Константин Чуприн |date=August 31, 2007 |work= |publisher= NVO NG|accessdate=}}</ref> The [[Azerbaijan Navy]] has about 2,200 personnel.<ref>[[Jane's Fighting Ships]], 2010, accessed February 2010.

In 2006, the US Government donated 3 motorboats to the Azerbaijani navy. In 2007 an agreement between Azeri Navy and a US military company was concluded, which stated that a part of the Azeri Navy would be equipped with advanced laser marksmanship systems. The US company specialists were also to give training on the use of the new equipment.<ref>[http://www.today.az/news/politics/40483.html Azeri Navy to be equipped with marksmanship system lasers]</ref> A number of separate U.S. programmes are underway under the [[Caspian Guard Initiative]], focused mostly on enhancing Azerbaijani and Kazakh maritime border security.

The [[Ministry of Defence Industry of Azerbaijan]] directs domestic military supplies for Azerbaijan. It was established in 2005. The Defence Industries Ministry subsumed the State Department for Military Industry and for Armaments and the Military Science Center, each of which was formerly a separate agency within the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry.

The defense industry has emerged as an autonomous entity with a growing defense production capability. The ministry is cooperating with the defense sectors of Ukraine, Belarus and Pakistan.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/02/2b0bdd2d-49a6-4bff-826d-05edefe4dbdb.html Azerbaijan Defense Industry]</ref> Along with other contracts, Azerbaijani defence industries and Turkish companies, Azerbaijan will produce 40mm revolver grenade launchers, 107mm and 122mm MLRS systems, Cobra 4×4 vehicles and joint modernization of BTR vehicles in Baku.<ref name="brothership1">[http://www.news.az/articles/politics/26065 Azerbaijan, Turkey to produce revolver grenade launchers]</ref><ref name="brothership2">[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136785 Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Defense Industry plans to assume several projects on technical modernization of Armed Forces]</ref><ref name="brothership3">[http://www.news.az/articles/politics/25988 Azerbaijan, Turkey sign contract on joint rocket production]</ref><ref name="brothership4">[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136603 Azerbaijani Defense Industry Ministry conducts negotiations with Turkish “Otokar” Company on production of armored vehicles]</ref>

Turkey has provided Azerbaijan with infantry weapons, tactical vehicles (jeeps, trucks, etc.) professional training, military organization, technology transfer, licenced military hardware production and other services. Due to help from Turkish specialists and instructors, thousands of Azerbaijani officers have been trained to western standards.<ref>[[NATO]], [http://www.nato.int/KFOR/chronicle/2002/chronicle_10/01.htm Azerbaijani troops part of the KFOR family]</ref>

Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul and Yaver Jamalov signed a protocol of intent on future joint production of two types of output - 107-mm rockets and the national rifle, possibly the Mehmetçik-1. A protocol of intent was signed the same day with the Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation [MKEK] on the joint production of 120-mm mortar launchers. This project will come into force in a few months time. Agreement has also been reached with Turkish company Aselsan on the production of some types of defence output in Azerbaijan, specifically the latest types of weapons' sights. These projects will probably happen in the near future too.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan to buy long-range rockets|url=http://www.news.az/articles/politics/36243|accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> Recently, Turkish defense industries secretariat told that an export version of the T-155 Firtina self-propelled howitser is almost done and could start production. T-155 has been powered by a German MTU power pack, which restricts the sale to some countries like Azerbaijan. The Turkish manufacturer MKEK, has announced that they have found an alternate supplier for the power pack where Azerbaijan showed interest to buy the high tech, more capable 155mm 52 caliber from Turkish authorities.

===United States===

[[Section 907]] of the United States [[Freedom Support Act]] bans any kind of direct United States [[aid]] to the Azerbaijani government. Despite this law there is extensive U.S. military cooperation with Azerbaijan. This has included Special Forces and naval aid, consultations with [[United States European Command]], and linkages through the U.S. National Guard [[State Partnership Program]].

On 19 May 2006, Azerbaijani Defense Minister [[Safar Abiyev]] and the then commander of [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] General [[Tom Hobbins]] met in [[Baku]] to discuss military cooperation. He said the objective of his visit was to become familiar with the state of Azerbaijani armed forces.<ref>[http://azernews.net/eng/gizli/view.php?d=14940 NATO & Azerbaijan relations]</ref> Hobbins pointed to the progress made in the NATO-Azerbaijan relations, saying that the successful implementation of the NATO [[Partnership for Peace]] program in Azerbaijan has brought the country even closer to the alliance. He said that the two countries' air forces will expand cooperation.<ref>[http://today.az/news/politics/26307.html U.S. & Azerbaijani Air Force cooperation]</ref>

The U.S. state of [[Oklahoma]] is linked with Azerbaijan through the [[U.S. National Guard]] [[State Partnership Program]] (SPP). [[Oklahoma National Guard]] troops have been sent on training and humanitarian missions to Baku.

===Israel===
Azerbaijan and [[Israel]] cooperate on numerous areas of the defense industry. Azerbaijan has shown great interest in Israeli technology over the years. In particular, an agreement was reached over the construction of the factory of intelligence and combat drones in Azerbaijan.<ref name="panarmenian.net">[http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/33537 Israel rearms Azerbaijani army] on [[PanARMENIAN.Net]]</ref><ref>[http://www.armenianreporter.am/go/article/2009-07-03-israel-azerbaijan-to-step-up-military-cooperation Washington briefing : Israel, Azerbaijan to step up military cooperation]</ref>

As of June 2009, Israel and Azerbaijan had been negotiating on the production of [[Namer (vehicle)|Namer]] armoured [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s in Azerbaijan.<ref>Panarmenian.net [http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/33537 panarmenian - Israel rearms Azerbaijani army], 30 June 2009</ref> There is no further information as to whether any agreement has been made.

===NATO===
[[File:Azerbaijani soldiers in Iraq 11.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijan deployed 150 peacekeepers during the [[Iraq War]]]]
The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and Azerbaijan actively cooperate on defence institutional reforms and have developed practical cooperation in many other areas. Azerbaijan’s [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) and its [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) linkages lay out the programme of cooperation between Azerbaijan and NATO.

The Azerbaijani government has however delayed implementing IPAP-recommended reforms, however, in part at least because no decision had been taken to seek NATO membership. This is because Azerbaijan's foreign policy 'seeks to balance interests with the U.S., EU, Russia and Iran.'<ref>[[International Crisis Group]], Azerbaijan: Defence Sector Reform and Management, Europe Briefing No.50, Baku/Tblisi/Brussels, 29 October 2008, p.1</ref>

According to a NATO diplomatic source some key officials at NATO headquarters in [[Brussel]]s were pushing hard for engaging Azerbaijan on the membership question. "[[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Baltic states]]," are among the member-states also backing a fast track for Azerbaijan’s NATO membership.<ref>[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav060409.shtml EurasiaNet.org - Eurasia insight - Azerbaijan: Baku can leapfrog over Ukraine, Georgia for NATO membership]</ref>

However, Azerbaijan made its policy of [[non-belligerent|not being aligned]] with a geopolitical/military structure official when it became a full member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 2011.

In 5 June 2006 the U.S. Departments of Defense and Homeland Security and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] held a training program for about 100 representatives of the [[Ministry of Emergency Situations of Azerbaijan Republic]], [[Republican Prosecutor's Office]], [[Azerbaijan Defense Ministry|Defense Ministry]] and other law-enforcement bodies. The objective of the training was to enhance Azerbaijan's ability to prevent the spread of weapon of mass destruction and related materials. According to a U.S. Embassy official, the program was organized as part of U.S. efforts to help Azerbaijan implement its NATO IPAP, specifically to strengthen Azerbaijan's ability to control its land and sea borders: "This training is being implemented within the frame of International struggle against spread of weapons of mass destruction. It is a good case that Azerbaijan is our active partner in struggle against spread of weapons of mass destruction".<ref>[http://today.az/news/society/27013.html Partnership for Peace training] and [http://today.az/news/politics/27639.html Military doctrine to be adopted]</ref>

There is also a limited amount of military cooperation with the other countries of [[GUAM]]: [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], Azerbaijan, and [[Moldova]].<ref>[http://www.perspektivy.info/rus/konturi/vojennoje_sotrudnichestvo_mezhdu_postsovetskimi_gosudarstvami_2008-09-25.htm Военное сотрудничество между постсоветскими государствами] {{ru icon}}</ref>
