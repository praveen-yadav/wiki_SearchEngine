In [[geography]] and [[agriculture]], '''arable land''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[wikt:aro#Latin|arāre]]''; “To [[plough]], To farm”) is land [[plough]]ed or tilled regularly, generally under a system of [[crop rotation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary: Arable land - Statistics explained|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Glossary:Arable_land|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>

According to definitions and survey recommendations by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), used by for example [[Eurostat]] and the [[World Bank]], arable land is [[agricultural land]] occupied by [[crops]] both sown and harvested during the same agricultural year, sometimes more than once. Land is also considered arable if used as temporary [[meadows]] for mowing or pasture, market and [[kitchen gardens]]; as well as temporarily fallow land — not seeded for one or more growing seasons, yet not left idle for more than five years.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAOSTAT - Concepts & definitions - Glossary (list)|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/375/default.aspx|publisher=FAO|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Agriculture statistics at regional level|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Agriculture_statistics_at_regional_level#Data_sources_and_availability|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2 November 2013|quote=Eurostat has followed the FAO's recommendation on the worldwide decennial agricultural census since the 1970 round}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Agriculture & Rural Development|url=http://data.worldbank.org/about/world-development-indicators-data/agriculture-and-rural-development|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>

[[Permanent crop]]s that occupy the land for some years and doesn't need to be replanted after each annual harvest — like coffee, rubber, flowering shrubs, fruit, nut trees and vines — is not counted as arable land, but as permanent cropland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary: Permanent Crops - Statitics explained|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Glossary:Permanent_crops|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The World Factbook, Field Listing: Land use|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2097.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>

Permanent [[pastures]] and meadows used for [[grazing]], land mowed for hay or [[silage]] not included in a crop rotation scheme, and abandoned land resulting from [[shifting cultivation]] is also not counted as arable, along with lands with built-on and barren areas, [[forests]] and [[woodland]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary: Permanent grassland - Statistics explained|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Glossary:Permanent_grassland|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Crops statistics - Concepts, definitions and classifications|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/ess/ess_test_folder/documents/Production_trade/definitions/Crops_statistics_concepts_definitions_classifications.doc|publisher=FAO Statistics|format=Word Document|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>

In 2008, the world's arable land amounted to 1,380 M ha, out of a total 4,883 M ha land used for agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAO Statistical Yearbook - Land use|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-publications/ess-yearbook/ess-yearbook2010/yearbook2010-reources/en/|publisher=FAOSTAT|page=A4|format=Excel|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>

Although constrained by land mass and topology, the amount of arable land, both regionally and globally, fluctuates due to human and climatic factors such as irrigation, deforestation, desertification, terracing, landfill, and urban sprawl. Researchers study the impact of these changes on food production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/006/Y4683E/y4683e06.htm |title=y4683e06 |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=30 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101008055558/http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y4683e/y4683e06.htm| archivedate= 8 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncapsa.org/Flash_Detail.asp?VJournalKey=73 |title=CAPSA Flash Detail |publisher=Uncapsa.org |date= |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>

The most productive portion of arable land is that from [[sediment]]s left by rivers and the sea. In modern times, rivers do not generally flood as often in areas employing [[flood control]].

Land which is unsuitable for arable farming usually has at least one of the following deficiencies: no source of fresh water; too hot ([[desert]]); too cold (Arctic); too rocky; too mountainous; too salty; too rainy; too snowy; [[soil pollution|too polluted]]; or too nutrient poor. Clouds may block the sunlight plants need for [[photosynthesis]], reducing productivity.  [[Starvation]] and [[nomad]]ism often exists on marginally arable land. Non-arable land is sometimes called ''wasteland'', ''badlands'', ''worthless'' or ''no man's land''.

However, non-arable land can sometimes be converted into arable land. New arable land makes more food, and can reduce [[starvation]]. This outcome also makes a country more [[self-sufficient]] and politically independent, because food importation is reduced. Making non-arable land arable often involves digging new irrigation canals and new wells, aqueducts, [[desalination]] plants, planting trees for shade in the desert, [[hydroponic]]s, fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, [[pesticide]]s, [[reverse osmosis]] water processors, [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] insulation or other insulation against heat and cold, digging ditches and hills for protection against the wind, and greenhouses with internal light and heat for protection against the cold outside and to provide light in cloudy areas. This process is often extremely expensive. An alternative is the [[Seawater Greenhouse]] which desalinates water through evaporation and condensation using solar energy as the only energy input. This technology is optimized to grow crops on desert land close to the sea.

Some examples of infertile '''non-arable''' land being turned into fertile '''arable''' land are:
* [[Aran Islands]]: These islands off the west coast of [[Ireland]], (not to be confused with the [[Isle of Arran]] in [[Scotland]]'s [[Firth of Clyde]]), were unsuitable for arable farming because they were too rocky. The people covered the islands with a shallow layer of seaweed and sand from the ocean. This made it arable. Today, crops are grown there.
* [[Israel]]: Israel's land primarily consisted of desert until the construction of [[desalination]] plants along the country's coast. The desalination plants, which remove the salt from ocean water, have created a new source of water for farming, drinking, and washing.
* [[Slash and burn]] agriculture uses nutrients in wood ash, but these expire within a few years

* [[Terra preta]], fertile tropical soils created by adding charcoal.

Some examples of fertile '''arable''' land being turned into infertile land are:
* Droughts like the '[[dust bowl]]' of the [[Great Depression]] in the U.S. turned farmland into desert.
* [[Rainforest]] Deforestation: The fertile tropical forests turn into infertile desert land. For example, [[Madagascar]]'s central highland plateau has become virtually totally barren (about ten percent of the country), as a result of [[slash-and-burn]] [[illegal logging in Madagascar|deforestation]], an element of [[shifting cultivation]] practiced by many natives.
* Each year, arable land is lost to desertification and [[erosion]] from human industrial activities. Improper irrigation of farm land can wick the [[sodium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]] from the soil and water to the surface. This process steadily concentrates salt in the root zone, decreasing productivity for crops that are not salt-tolerant.
