'''Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|ŋ|k|ɔr|d}} is a retired [[turbojet]]-powered supersonic passenger airliner or [[supersonic transport]] (SST).  It is one of only two SSTs to have entered commercial service; the other was the [[Tupolev Tu-144]].  Concorde was jointly developed and produced by [[Aérospatiale]] and the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC) under an Anglo-French treaty. First flown in 1969, Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued commercial flights for 27 years.

Among other [[#Scheduled flights|destinations]], Concorde flew regular [[transatlantic flight]]s from [[London Heathrow]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]] and [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles]]; it profitably flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners. With only 20 aircraft built, the development of Concorde was a substantial economic loss; [[Air France]] and [[British Airways]] also received considerable government subsidies to purchase them. Concorde was retired in 2003 due to a general downturn in the aviation industry after the type's [[Air France Flight 4590|only crash in 2000]], the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] in 2001 and a decision by Airbus, the successor firm of Aérospatiale and BAC, to discontinue maintenance support.<ref name="BBC Concorde Grounded">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title=UK &#124; Concorde grounded for good |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-04-10 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref>

A total of 20 aircraft were built in France and the United Kingdom; six of these were prototypes and development aircraft. Seven each were delivered to [[Air France]] and [[British Airways]].  [[#Naming|Concorde's name]] reflects the development agreement between the United Kingdom and France. In the UK, any or all of the type—unusually for an aircraft—are known simply as "Concorde", without an article. The aircraft is regarded by many people as an aviation icon and an engineering marvel.<ref name="Concorde beats"/>

==Development==
===Slender deltas===
The origins of the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, when [[Arnold Hall]], director of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) asked [[Morien Morgan]] to form a committee to study the SST concept. The group met for the first time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in mid-1955. 

At the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.<ref group=N>In particular, R. T. Jones' work at NACA demonstrated this in depth.</ref> This led to the use of very short-span, very thin rectangular wings like those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]]. This same short span produced very little lift at low speed, which resulted in extremely long takeoff runs and frighteningly high landing speeds.<ref>Jan Meyer, [http://starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html "High altitude flying with F-104"], Starfighterens veneer Norge</ref> In an SST design, this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways, or, as the report put it, "Some horribly large aeroplanes."{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Based on this, the group considered the concept of an SST unfeasible, and instead suggested continued low-levels studies into supersonic aerodynamics.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}

Soon after, [[Dietrich Küchemann]] at the RAE published a series of reports on a new wing planform, known in the UK as the "slender delta" concept.<ref name= 'deltawing'>{{cite journal |url= http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723&setcookie=yes |title= The development of the slender delta concept |journal=Aircraft Engineering |author=Maltby, R.L. |volume= 40, 1968 |year= }}</ref> Küchemann's team, including Eric Maskell and Johanna Weber, discovered that delta wings can produce strong [[vortex]]es on their upper surfaces at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by [[Chuck Yeager]] in the [[Convair XF-92]], but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Küchemann suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}

Küchemann's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design almost overnight. Although the delta had already been used on aircraft prior to this point, these designs used planforms that were not much different than a [[swept wing]] of the same span.<ref group=N>Consider especially the [[English Electric Lightning]], who's wing can be considered either a highly swept rectangle, or a delta with a notch cut out of the root.</ref> Küchemann noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over, which suggested that the effect would be maximized by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible. Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span, while also offering reasonable takeoff and landing speeds using vortex generation. The only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to takeoff and land very "nose high" in order to generate the required vortex lift, which led to questions about the low speed handling qualities of such a design.<ref name=brown/> It would also need to have long [[landing gear]] to produce the required angles while still on the runway.

Küchemann presented the idea at a meeting where Morgan was also present. [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] recalls Morgan's reaction to the presentation, saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the SST problem. Brown considers this moment as being the true birth of the Concorde project.<ref name=brown>Eric Brown, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=MMEK1jwD03AC&pg=PT121 "Wings On My Sleeve"], Hachette UK, 2008, end of Chapter 12</ref>

===STAC===
On 1 October 1956 the [[Ministry of Supply]] asked Morgan to form a new study group, the '''Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee''' or '''STAC''',{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=39}} with the explicit goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, the decision was made to fund the development of a testbed aircraft to examine the low speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the [[Handley Page HP.115]].<ref name=brown/> This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as 69&nbsp;mph, about ⅓rd that of the Starfighter.<ref>Jim Winchester, "Handley Page HP.115 (1961)", in "X-Planes and Prototypes", Amber Books, 2005, p. 134.</ref>

During this time Küchemann had continued development of the slender delta, and discovered that the vortex was greatly improved if the forward section of the wing was placed at a steeper sweep angle. This led to the "compound delta" design, which immediately started appearing on designs around the world. Almost every late 1950s SST concept uses the compound delta.<ref group=N>A compound delta was used on the [[Lockheed L-2000]], later models of the [[Boeing 2707]], the French SST designs, and even early models of the [[Space Shuttle]]. The best example is the Tu-144, which retained this layout in production.</ref> By 1959, STAC had further developed the concept and showed that the ultimate evolution of the design was a smoothly curving [[leading edge]], closely following the design of an [[ogee]] archway.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=68}} 

Based on this "ogival wing", STAC claimed that an SST would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, they would be able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so less aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.

STAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work, a transatlantic model and a shorter-range version flying at slower speeds. Morgan suggested that a 150 passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £75 to £90 million to develop to production, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80 million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of a market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=68}}

In 1959 a study contract was let to [[Hawker Siddeley]] and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept,{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}} which developed as the [[Hawker Siddeley HSA.1000|HSA.1000]] and [[Bristol 223]]. [[Armstrong Whitworth]] also responded with an internal design, the "M-Wing", for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959 Hawker approached [[Lockheed]], and after the creation of [[British Aircraft Corporation]] in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Douglas Aircraft]] and [[Sud Aviation]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}

===Partnership with Sud===
By this time similar political and economic concerns in [[France]] had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud and [[Nord Aviation|Nord]], as well as [[Dassault]].<ref group=N>This apparently took place some time in 1957, according to Conway's unclear statement about "the following year" which apparently references the first STAC meeting in late 1956.</ref> All three returned designs based on Küchemann's slender delta; Nord suggested a [[ramjet]] powered design flying at Mach 3, the other two were jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the [[Sud Aviation Super Caravelle]] won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}

As soon as the design was complete, in April 1960, Pierre Satre, the company's technical director, was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership. By this point the various US companies had proved uninterested in such a venture, likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company, and the risk of "giving away" US technological leadership to a European partner.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}} The two teams quickly found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already concluded they would be buying a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]]). As neither company had experience in the use of high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminum could be used &mdash; above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminum begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that Küchemann's ogive design was the right one.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}

The only disagreements were over the size and range. The UK team was still focussed on a 150 passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved not the be the barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and two or three engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed. The teams continued to met through 1961.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}} While the development teams met, French Minister of Public Works and Transport [[Robert Burton]] was meeting with the UK Minister of Aviation [[Peter Thorneycroft]], and Thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the French were much more serious about a partnership than any of the US companies.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}

===Cabinet response, treaty===
When the STAC plans were presented to the UK cabinet, a very negative reaction resulted. The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be £150 million, which were constantly being overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting that there was no way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that "the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including the recent history of the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the £150 million [cost] to turn out much too low."{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}

This concern led to an independent review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered for the simple reason that everyone else was going supersonic, and it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}

After considerable argument, the decision to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the [[European Common Market]], which was being controlled by [[Charles de Gaulle]] who felt the UK's [[Special Relationship ]] with the US made it unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would pave the way for Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}}

The development project was negotiated as an international [[treaty]] between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft treaty was signed on 29 November 1962.<ref name="earlyhist">[http://www.concordesst.com/history/eh1.html#a "Early History."] ''concordesst.com''. Retrieved 8 September 2007.</ref>

Unfortunately for the UK, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}}

===Naming===
Reflecting the treaty between the British and French governments which led to Concorde's construction, the name ''Concorde'' is from the French word ''[[wikt:concorde#French|concorde]]'' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ̃kɔʁd|IPA}}), which has an English equivalent, ''[[wikt:concord#English|concord]]''. Both words mean ''agreement'', ''harmony'' or ''union''. The name was officially changed to ''Concord'' by [[Harold Macmillan]] in response to a perceived slight by [[Charles de Gaulle]]. In 1967, at the French roll-out in [[Toulouse]] the British Government [[Minister for Technology]], [[Tony Benn]], announced that he would change the spelling back to ''Concorde''.<ref name="Benn">{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1064752,00.html |title= Sonic booms and that 'e' on the end: Tony Benn remembers his role in getting Concorde off the ground |first= Tony |last= Benn |publisher=''The Guardian,'' 17 October 2003 |location=London |date= 17 October 2003}}</ref> This created a nationalist uproar that died down when Benn stated that the suffixed 'e' represented "Excellence, England, Europe and [[Entente Cordiale|Entente (Cordiale)]]." In his memoirs, he recounts a tale of a letter from an irate Scotsman claiming: "[Y]ou talk about 'E' for England, but part of it is made in Scotland." Given Scotland’s contribution of providing the nose cone for the aircraft, Benn replied, "[I]t was also 'E' for '[[wikt:Écosse#French|Écosse]]' (the French name for Scotland) &nbsp;— and I might have added 'e' for extravagance and 'e' for escalation as well!"<ref>McIntyre 1992, p. 20.</ref>

Concorde also acquired an unusual [[nomenclature]] for an aircraft. In common usage in the United Kingdom, the type is known as ''Concorde'' without an [[article (grammar)|article]], rather than '''''the''' Concorde'' or '''''a''' Concorde''.<ref>Note this British convention is used throughout this article: {{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2003/concorde_retirement/default.stm |title= In depth: Farewell to Concorde |publisher=''BBC News,'' 15 August 2007 |date=15 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.britishairways.com/concorde/aboutconcorde.html |title= About Concorde – main page |publisher=''British Airways'' |accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref>

===Sales efforts===

At first the new consortium intended to produce one long-range and one short-range version. However, prospective customers showed no interest in the short-range version and it was dropped.<ref name="earlyhist"/>

The consortium secured orders (i.e., non-binding options) for over 100 of the long-range version from the major airlines of the day: [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], and Air France were the launch customers, with six Concordes each.

===Testing===
The design work was supported by a preceding research programme studying the flight characteristics of low ratio [[delta wing]]s. The supersonic [[Fairey Delta 2|BAC 221]] was modified for flight tests of the high speed flight envelope,<ref>Taylor 1965, p. 130.</ref> the [[Handley Page HP.115]] also provided valuable information on low speed performance.<ref>Winchester 2005, p. 134.</ref>

Construction of two prototypes began in February 1965: 001, built by Aerospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at [[Filton]], [[Bristol]]. Concorde 001 made its first test flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969, piloted by [[André Turcat]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=KXoyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GLkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6573,360672&dq=concorde&hl=en |title= Pilot Says Concorde Flight "Perfect" |publisher=''Montreal Gazette,'' |accessdate=30 June 2011 |year= 1969 |unused_data= 1 March date= }}</ref> and first went supersonic on 1 October.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C1EFC3454127B93C0A9178BD95F4D8685F9 |title= Concorde Tops Speed of Sound for 9 Minutes on a Test Flight |publisher=''The New York Times,'' 2 October 1969 |date= 2 October 1969}}</ref> The first UK-built Concorde flew from Filton to [[RAF Fairford]] on 9 April 1969, piloted by [[Brian Trubshaw]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/2/newsid_2514000/2514535.stm |title= 1969: Concorde flies for the first time |publisher=''BBC News,'' 2 March 1969 |accessdate=8 July 2007 |date=2 March 1969}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/584606362.html?dids=584606362:584606362&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+10%2C+1969&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Concorde+002+Makes+1st+Flight&pqatl=google |title= Concorde 002 Makes 1st Flight |publisher=''Chicago Tribune,'' 10 April 1969 |first=Edward |last=Rohrbach |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=10 April 1969}}</ref> Both prototypes were presented to the public for the first time on 7–8 June 1969 at the Paris Airshow.

While Concorde had initially held a great deal of customer interest, the project was hit by a large number of order cancellations. The Paris Le Bourget air show crash of the competing Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-144]] had shocked potential buyers, and public concern over the environmental issues presented by a supersonic aircraft – the [[sonic boom]], [[takeoff]]-noise and pollution – had produced a shift in public opinion of SSTs. By 1976 four nations remained as prospective buyers: Britain, France, China, and Iran.<ref>{{cite news |title= Concordes limited to 16 |publisher=''Virgin Islands Daily News,'' 5 June 1976}}</ref> Only Air France and British Airways (the successor to BOAC) took up their orders, with the two governments taking a cut of any profits made.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.britishairways.com/concorde/faq.html#6 |title= Payments for Concorde |publisher=''British Airways'' |accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref>

The United States cancelled the [[Boeing 2707]], its rival supersonic transport programme, in 1971. Observers have suggested that opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution had been encouraged by the [[United States Government]], as it lacked its own competitor.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D16F93C54137A93C0A81789D85F478785F9 |title= Britain and France have wasted billions on the Concorde |publisher=''The New York Times,'' 12 February 1973 |first= Anthony |last= Lewis |date= 12 February 1973}}</ref> The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern, although some of these restrictions were later relaxed.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70813F83F5511728DDDAE0994DA415B888BF1D3 |title= Malaysia lifting ban on the use Of its Airspace by the Concorde |publisher='' The New York Times,'' 17 December 1978 |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=17 December 1978}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=xTMsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=48sEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6855,2298265&dq=india+concorde&hl=en |title= News from around the world |publisher=''Herald-Journal,'' 13 January 1978 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration as having been an act of [[protectionism]] of American aircraft manufacturers.<ref>Ross 1978, p. 46.</ref>

Concorde had other considerable difficulties that led to its dismal sales performance. Costs had spiralled during development to more than six times the original projections, arriving at a unit cost of £23&nbsp;million in 1977.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1352927/Is-this-the-end-of-the-Concorde-dream.html |title= Is this the end of the Concorde dream? |publisher=''Daily Telegraph,'' 16 August 2000 |first= Paul |last= Marston |date= 16 August 2000 |location=London}}</ref> World events had also dampened Concorde sales prospects, the [[1973 oil crisis]] had many airlines think twice about aircraft with high rates of fuel consumption; and new [[wide-body aircraft]], such as the [[Boeing 747]], had recently made subsonic aircraft significantly more efficient and presented a low-risk option for airlines.<ref>Ross 1978, pp. 47–49.</ref> While carrying a full load, Concorde achieved 15.8 [[passenger miles]] per gallon of fuel, while the [[Boeing 707]] reached 33.3 pm/g, the Boeing 747 46.4 pm/g, and the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] 53.6 pm/g.<ref>Ross 1978, p. 49.</ref> An emerging trend in the industry in favour of cheaper airline tickets had also caused airlines such as Qantas to question Concorde's market suitability.<ref>Gunn 2010, p. 45.</ref>

Concorde is an [[ogive|ogival]] (also "ogee") [[delta-wing]]ed aircraft with four [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593|Olympus]] engines based on those employed in the RAF's [[Avro Vulcan]] [[strategic bomber]]. Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) [[fly-by-wire]] flight-control system; the avionics of Concorde were unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ [[Hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid circuits]].<ref name='elecflybywire' /> The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with [[Archibald Russell|Sir Archibald Russell]] as his deputy.<ref>{{cite news |first= Peter |last= Masefield |title= Obituary: Sir Archibald Russell |publisher=''The Independent,'' 1 July 1995 |location=UK |date= }}</ref>

Concorde needed to fly long distances to be economically viable; this required high efficiency. Turbofan engines were rejected due to their larger cross-section producing excessive drag. [[Turbojet]]s were found to be the best choice of engines.<ref>Birtles, Philip. ''Concorde'', pp. 62–63. Vergennes, Vermont: Plymouth Press, 2000. ISBN 1-882663-44-6.</ref> The engine used was the twin spool [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593]], a development of the Bristol engine first used for the [[Avro Vulcan]] bomber, and developed into an afterburning supersonic variant for the [[BAC TSR-2]] strike bomber.<ref name="wingweb">[http://www.wingweb.co.uk/engines/Olympus593_MK610.html "Rolls Royce Olympus history."] ''wingweb.co.uk''. Retrieved 15 January 2010.</ref>

The aircraft used reheat ([[afterburner]]s) at takeoff and to pass through the upper [[transonic]] regime and to supersonic speeds, between Mach 0.95 and Mach 1.7.  The afterburners were switched off at all other times.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A9110958AH&q=Rolls-Royce%2FSnecma+Olympus+593&uid=788858323&setcookie=yes |title= The Rolls Royce/SNECMA Olympus 593 engine operational experience and the lessons learned |publisher=''European Symposium on the Future of High Speed Air Transport'' |author=Ganley, G. |coauthors= G. Laviec |year= 1989 |pages= 73–80 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> Due to jet engines being [[propulsive efficiency|highly inefficient at low speeds]], Concorde burned two tonnes of fuel (almost 2% of the maximum fuel load) taxiing to the runway.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5195964.stm |title= Are the skies turning green? |publisher=BBC News |first= Joe |last= Lynam |date= 19 July 2006}}</ref> Fuel used is [[Jet fuel|Jet A-1]]. Due to the high power produced even with the engines at idle, only the two outer engines were run after landing for easier taxiing. 

The intake design for Concorde’s engines was especially critical.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.sae.org/technical/papers/912180 |title= Concorde Propulsion—Did we get it right? The Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 Engine reviewed |publisher=SAE International |author=Ganley, G. A. |date= September 1991}}</ref> Conventional jet engines can take in air at only around Mach 0.5; therefore the air has to be slowed from the Mach 2.0 airspeed that enters the engine intake. In particular, Concorde needed to control the shock waves that this reduction in speed generates to avoid damage to the engines. This was done by a pair of [[intake ramp]]s and an auxiliary spill door, whose position moved in-flight to slow transiting air.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/rm/3711.pdf |title= On the sub-critical stability of variable ramp intakes at Mach numbers around 2 |journal=Aeronautical Research Council |author=Fisher, S.A. |coauthors= M.C. Neale and A.J. Brooks |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1972 |year= }}</ref>

Engine failure causes problems on conventional [[subsonic aircraft]]; not only does the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank in the direction of the failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2003/10/21/172657/concorde-special-the-test-pilot-john-cochrane.html |title= Concorde Special – The test pilot – John Cochrane |publisher=[[Flight International]] |date= 21 October 2003}}</ref> During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero so, on Concorde, engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63710463.html |title= How a Concorde pilot would handle a nightmare failure |publisher=Birmingham Post |first= Peter |last= Woodman |date= 27 July 2000}}</ref>

===Heating issues===
Air friction on the outer surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch by end of the flight.<ref>Dalton, Alastair. [http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/supersonic-the-enduring-allure-of-concorde-1-2415088 "Supersonic: The enduring allure of Concorde"]. Scotsman.com, 17 July 2012.</ref>  Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft, due to [[aerodynamic heating]], is the [[nose cone|nose]]. The engineers used [[Hiduminium|Hiduminium R.R. 58]], an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft due to its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was {{convert|127|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.2307/3951418 |title= When the SST Is Too Slow.. |publisher= Society for Science & the Public |journal= Science News |first= Jonathan |last= Eberhart |volume= 91 |issue= 22, 3 June 1967 |date= |pages= 528–529 |jstor= 3951418}}</ref> Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1108/eb034143 |url= http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkpdf&contentId=1681441 |title= The Concorde takes shape : Test programme and construction proceeding according to schedule |publisher=MCB UP |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |page= 38 |year= 1966 |volume= 38 |issue= 4, 1966 |issn= 0002-2667}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |bibcode= 1972NASSP.309..631N |volume= 309 |title= Fatigue Tests on Big Structure Assemblies of Concorde Aircraft |page= 631 |publisher=NASA |year= 1972 |author=N'guyen, V.P. |coauthor= J.P.

Owing to [[Drag (physics)|air friction]] as the plane travelled at [[supersonic speed]], the fuselage would heat up and [[Thermal expansion|expand]] by as much as 300&nbsp;mm (almost 1&nbsp;ft).  The most obvious manifestation of this being a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the [[flight engineer]]'s console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/business/147276_pilot07.html |first= James |last= Wallace |title= Those who flew the Concorde will miss it |publisher=Seattle Post |date= 7 November 2003}}</ref> To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a [[heat sink]] for the heat from the air conditioning.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Introduction to Concorde: A brief review of the Concorde and its prospects |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |author=Gedge, G.T. |coauthor= M.I. Prod |year= |volume= 40 |issue= 3, 1993}}</ref> The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.<ref>Owen 2001, p. 14.</ref>

Concorde had [[aircraft livery|livery]] restrictions; the majority of the surface had to be covered with a [[Anti-flash white|highly reflective white]] paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by between six to 11 degrees Celsius.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%200821.html |title=1967 &#124; 0821 &#124; Flight Archive |publisher=Flightglobal.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, with the exception of the wings, in a promotional deal with [[Pepsi]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4794332.html |title= Is this the colour of the new millennium? |publisher=''The Independent,'' 3 April 1996 |location=UK |date= }}</ref> In this paint scheme, Air France were advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.<ref>{{cite web |title= Azul contra rojo |publisher=''El Mundo,'' 5 April 1996 |first= Cristina |last= Frade |date= }}</ref>

===Structural issues===
[[File:Concorde fuel trim.svg|thumb|upright|Fuel pitch trim]]

Due to the high speeds at which Concorde travelled, large forces were applied to the aircraft's structure during banks and turns. This caused twisting and the distortion of the aircraft’s structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds; both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard [[elevons]], varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which are attached to the stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed.<ref>Owen 2001, p. 78.</ref> Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed.<ref name="nova" /> This was visible from the rear passengers’ viewpoints.<ref name="popular">Kocivar, Ben. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lpiMSzja6W4C&lpg=PA142&dq=concorde%20flexing&pg=PA118#v=onepage&q=concorde%20flexing&f=false "Aboard the Concorde SST."] ''Popular Science,'' October 1973, p. 117.</ref>

When any aircraft passes the [[critical mach]] of that particular airframe, the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down force on the aircraft if the centre of mass remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, but there was still a shift of about 2&nbsp;metres. This could have been countered by the use of [[airfoil|trim controls]], but at such high speeds this would have caused a dramatic increase in the drag on the aircraft. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of mass, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.<ref name= 'fueltrim'>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1108/eb035344 |url= http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkpdf&contentId=1682642 |title= Flight Refuelling Limited and Concorde: The fuel system aboard is largely their work |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |publisher=MCB UP |volume= 48 |issue= 9, September 1976 |issn= 0002-2667 |pages= 20–21 |date= }}</ref>

===Range===
In order to fly non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean, Concorde was developed to have the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft. This was achieved by a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds,{{#tag:ref|"It is the world's most efficient jet engine." -Ricky Bastin, Concorde Engineer<ref name=nova/>|group=N}}<ref name=nova/> a slender fuselage with high [[fineness ratio]], and a complex wing shape for a high [[lift to drag ratio]]. This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity, and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.<ref name= 'deltawing'/><ref name= 'fueltrim'/>

Nevertheless, soon after Concorde began flying, a Concorde "B" model was designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with [[leading edge slats]] to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds, with the objective of expanding the range to reach markets in new regions.<ref>[http://www.concordesst.com/concordeb.html "Concorde model 'B'"]</ref> It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy reheat. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=N9222540AH&q=Concorde+engines&uid=788858323&setcookie=yes |title= Propulsion challenges and opportunities for high-speed transport aircraft |publisher=''Aeropropulsion,'' 1987 |author=Strack, William |year= |pages= 437–452 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> This would have given {{convert|500|mi|0|abbr=on}} additional range and a greater payload, making new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=Q-0cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rGcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6914,3256355&dq=tu+144&hl=en |title= Fuel costs kill Second Generation of Concordes |first= Alison |last= Smale |publisher=''Sarasota Herald-Tribune,'' 22 September 1979 |date= }}</ref>

Airliner cabins were usually maintained at a pressure equivalent to 6,000–8,000&nbsp;feet (1,800–2,400 m) elevation. Concorde’s pressurisation was set to an altitude at the lower end of this range, {{convert|6000|ft|m}}.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1093/occmed/17.2.47 |url= http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/17/2/47.pdf |title= Human Factors in the Concorde |journal=Occupational Medicine |last= Hepburn |first= A.N. |volume= 17 |issue= 2, 1967 |year= 1967 |pages= 47–51}}</ref> Concorde’s maximum cruising altitude was {{convert|60000|ft|m}}; subsonic airliners typically cruise below {{convert|40000|ft|m}}.

===Flight characteristics===
[[File:Concorde at Baginton - geograph.org.uk - 156846.jpg|thumb|left|Concorde performing a low-level flypast at an air show in August 1981]]

While commercial jets took eight hours to fly from New York to Paris, the average supersonic flight time on the transatlantic routes was just under 3.5 hours. Concorde had a maximum cruise altitude of {{convert|18,300|m|ft|0}} and an average cruise speed of Mach 2.02, about 1155 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] (2140&nbsp;km/h or 1334&nbsp;mph), more than twice the speed of conventional aircraft.<ref>Schrader 1989, p. 64.</ref>

With no other civil traffic operating at its cruising altitude of about {{convert|56000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, dedicated [[North Atlantic Tracks|oceanic airways]] or "tracks" were used by Concorde to cross the Atlantic. Due to the nature of high altitude winds, these SST tracks were fixed in terms of their co-ordinates, unlike the [[North Atlantic Tracks]] at lower altitudes whose co-ordinates alter daily according to forecast weather patterns.<ref name="Orlebar p. 84">Orlebar 2002, p. 84.</ref> Concorde would also be cleared in a {{convert|15000|ft|m|sing=on}} block, allowing for a slow climb from 45,000 to {{convert|60000|ft|m|abbr=on}} during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased.<ref>[[Shanwick Oceanic Control|Prestwick Oceanic Area Control Centre]]: Manual of Air Traffic Services (Part 2).

The delta-shaped wings forced Concorde to attain a higher [[angle of attack]] at low speeds than conventional aircraft, but it allowed the formation of large low pressure vortices over the entire upper wing surface, maintaining lift.<ref>Orlebar 2002, p. 44.</ref> The normal landing speed was {{convert|170|mph|km/h|0}}.<ref>Schrader 1989, p. 84.</ref> Because of this high angle, during a landing approach Concorde was on the "back side" of the [[Parasitic drag|drag force]] curve, where raising the nose would increase the sink rate; the aircraft was thus largely flown on the throttle and was fitted with an autothrottle to reduce the pilot's workload.<ref>Orlebar 2002, p. 110.</ref>

"The only thing that tells you that you're moving is that occasionally when you're flying over the subsonic aeroplanes you can see all these 747s 20,000 feet below you almost appearing to go backwards, I mean you are going 800 miles an hour or thereabouts faster than they are. The aeroplane was an absolute delight to fly, it handled beautifully. And remember we are talking about an aeroplane that was being designed in the late 1950s - mid 1960s. I think it's absolutely amazing and here we are, now in the 21st century, and it remains unique" - John Hutchinson, Concorde Captain<ref>The World's Greatest Airliner, 2003, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uMm16fUwoQ]</ref>

}}
Because of the way Concorde's delta-wing generated lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually strong. At [[Rotation (aviation)|rotation]], Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots [[indicated airspeed]]), this increased the stresses on the rear undercarriage in a way that was initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html |title= The real story of Flight 4590: Special Investigation |publisher=''iasa.com.au,'' 13 May 2001 |first= David |last= Rose |date= }}</ref> Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes. The rear main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to retract telescopically before swinging in order to clear each other when stowed.<ref>Brooklands Museum</ref> The four main wheel tyres on each [[bogie]] unit are inflated to 232&nbsp;lb/sq in. The twin-wheel nose undercarriage retracts forwards and its tyres are inflated to a pressure of 191&nbsp;lb/sq in, and the wheel assembly carries a spray deflector to prevent standing water being thrown up into the engine intakes. The tyres are rated to 250&nbsp;mph. The starboard nose wheel carries a single disc brake to halt wheel rotation whilst the undercarriage is being retracted. The port nose wheel carries speed generators for the anti-skid braking system which prevents brake activation until nose and main wheels are rotating at the same rate.

Additionally, due to the high average takeoff speed of {{convert|250|mph|km/h}}, Concorde needed upgraded brakes. Like most airliners, Concorde has [[anti-lock braking system|anti-skid braking]] – a system which prevents the tyres from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll-out. The brakes, developed by [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]], were the first carbon-based brakes used on an airliner.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Design and Engineering of Carbon Brakes |publisher=The Royal Society |author=Stimson, I.L. |coauthors= R.

===Droop nose===
Concorde’s drooping nose, developed by [[Marshall Aerospace]],<ref name="Concorde nose">{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%201503.html |title = Droop nose |publisher = Flight International |date = 12 August 1971 |pages = 257–258}}</ref> enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimum aerodynamic efficiency, and not obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, takeoff, and landing operations. Due to the high angle of attack the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose was accompanied by a moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would raise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.<ref name="Concorde nose"/>

[[File:Concorde landing Farnborough Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|left|Concorde landing at [[Farnborough Aerodrome|Farnborough]] in September 1974]]
A controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and takeoff. Following takeoff and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximum visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the five-degree position to avoid the possibility of damage.<ref name="Concorde nose"/>

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] had objected to the restrictive visibility of the visor used on the first two prototype Concordes and thus requiring alteration before the FAA would permit Concorde to serve US airports; this led to the redesigned visor used on the production and the four pre-production aircraft (101, 102, 201, and 202).<ref>Owen 2001, p. 84.</ref> The nose window and visor glass needed to endure temperatures in excess of 100&nbsp;°C at supersonic flight were developed by [[Pilkington|Triplex]].<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202105.html "Triplex in Concorde: The story behind the film."] ''Flightglobal.com,'' 1968.

In 1977, British Airways and [[Singapore Airlines]] shared a Concorde for flights between London and [[Singapore International Airport]] at Paya Lebar via Bahrain.

During the [[Mexican oil boom]], Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City’s [[Benito Juárez International Airport]] via Washington, DC, or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=uekpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4tIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4845,5120670&dq=concorde+mexico&hl=en |title= French Concorde to Mexico City |publisher=''Daytona Beach Morning Journal,'' 11 August 1978 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=TuwwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8t8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3054,6003139&dq=concorde+mexico&hl=en |title= Supersonic Jet flights suspended |publisher=''Daytona Beach Morning Journal,'' 27 September 1982 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> The worldwide economic crisis during that period resulted in this route’s cancellation; the last flights were almost empty. The routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida to the east and south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-5212185.html |title= Air France offering 'New Year's Eve in Paris.' |publisher=''PR Newswire,'' 2 October 1987 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>

===British Caledonian interest===
Following the launch of British Airways' Concorde services, Britain's other major airline, [[British Caledonian]] (BCal), set up a task force headed by Gordon Davidson, BA's former Concorde director, to investigate the possibility of their own Concorde operations.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%200919.html ''B.CAL appoints Concorde consultant''.] Flight International, 24 March 1979, p. 881.</ref><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201617.html ''Caledonian reports best results''.] Flight International, 12 May 1979, p. 1547.</ref><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%202664.html ''New job for B.CAL Concorde man''.] Flight International, 21 July 1979, p. 158.</ref> This was seen as particularly viable for the airline's long-haul network as there were two unsold aircraft then available for purchase.<ref name="whitetails">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%200541.html ''B.CAL to lease unsold Concorde?''.] Flight International, 24 February 1979, p. 517.</ref><ref name="Concorde_details">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201182.html ''Tories support B.CAL's Concorde plan''.] Flight International, 14 April 1979, p. 1132.</ref><ref name="final_SST">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201348.html World News.] Flight International, 28 April 1979, p. 1286.</ref>

One important reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the [[British Caledonian in the 1970s#Spheres of influence|British Government's 1976 aviation policy review]] had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence.  To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, as well as a partnership with BA.<ref>''High Risk: The Politics of the Air'', Thomson, A., Sidgwick and Jackson, London, 1990, pp. 316–317.</ref><ref name="cancel_Concorde">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%202433.html ''B.CAL drops Concorde plans but asks for Hong Kong licence''.] Flight International, 30 June 1979, p. 2331.</ref> BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network;<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%202766.html ''BCAL's African Profit ...''.] World News, Flight International, 23 December 1971, p. 994.</ref><ref>''The Caledonian punchbag'', Flight International, 21 March 1987, p. 33.</ref> BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.<ref name="Concorde_details"/><ref name="cancel_Concorde"/><ref name="BCAL_Concorde">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201007.html ''Cheaper fares on Swedish routes?'', Air Transport, Flight International, 31 March 1979, p. 965]</ref>

BCal entered into a bid to acquire at least one Concorde.<ref name="whitetails"/><ref name="final_SST"/><ref name="BCAL_Concorde"/> However, BCal eventually arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and [[Aérospatiale]] respectively, to be maintained by either BA or Air France. BCal's envisaged two-Concorde fleet would have required a high level of [[Airline cost glossary#Aircraft Utilization|aircraft utilisation]] to be cost-effective; therefore, BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta, with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax.<ref name="Concorde_details"/> Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage.<ref name="BCAL_Concorde"/><ref name="BCal_Package">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201711.html ''Two Concordes, A310s and 20 new routes in B.CAL package'', Air Transport, Flight International, 19 May 1979, p. 1637]</ref> Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980; however, steeply rising oil prices caused by the [[1979 energy crisis]] led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions.<ref name="cancel_Concorde"/>

===British Airways buys its Concordes outright===
[[File:Concorde at JFK.jpg|thumb|An Air France Concorde at John F. Kennedy International Airport in 1987]]

By around 1981 in the UK, the future for Concorde looked bleak. The British government had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, [[John King, Baron King of Wartnaby|Sir John King]], convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to British Airways for £16.5&nbsp;million plus the first year’s profits.<ref>Backroom boys&nbsp;— Francis Spufford</ref><ref name= 'concewhitele'>{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/632500842.html?dids=632500842:632500842&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+01%2C+1984&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=The+plane+fact+is%2C+Concorde+has+broken+the+profit+barrier+for+the+first+time&pqatl=google |title= The plane fact is, Concorde has broken the profit barrier for the first time |publisher=''Chicago Tribune,'' 1 April 1984 |first= Peter |last= Greenberg |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=1 April 1984}}</ref>

===Concorde Flight 4590 crash===
{{Main|Air France Flight 4590}}

On 25 July 2000, Air France Flight 4590, registration F-BTSC, crashed in [[Gonesse]], France after departing from [[Paris Charles de Gaulle]] en route to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[New York City]], killing all 100 passengers and nine crew members on board the flight, and four people on the ground. It was the only fatal accident involving Concorde.  

According to the official investigation conducted by the ''[[Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile]]'' (BEA), the crash was caused by a metallic strip that fell from a [[Continental Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre<!-- please leave British spelling of "tyres" on British/French aircraft ---> on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during takeoff. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.<ref>Endres 2001, pp. 110–113.</ref> 

Prior to the accident, Concorde had been arguably the safest operational passenger airliner in the world in terms of passenger deaths-per-kilometres travelled with zero, but had a rate of tyre damage some 30 times higher than subsonic airliners from 1995 to 2000.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-82753359.html |title= Human Factor Issues Emerge from Concorde Crash Investigation |journal=Air Safety Week, 11 February 2002 |year= |accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bea.aero/docspa/2000/f-sc000725a/pdf/f-sc000725a.pdf |title= Accident on 25 July 2000 at La Patte d’Oie in Gonesse (95) to the Concorde registered F-BTSC operated by Air France |publisher=French Bureau Enquêtes-Accidents (BEA), January 2002 |year= |pages= 145–147 |accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref> Safety improvements were made in the wake of the crash, including more secure electrical controls, [[Kevlar]] lining on the fuel tanks and specially developed burst-resistant tyres.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1442061.stm |title= Concorde's safety modifications |publisher=''BBC News,'' 17 July 2001 |date=17 July 2001}}</ref> On 6 December 2010, Continental Airlines and John Taylor, one of their mechanics, were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter,<ref>Cody, E.

The first flight after the modifications departed from [[London Heathrow airport|London Heathrow]] on 17 July 2001, piloted by BA Chief Concorde Pilot [[Mike Bannister]].

Concorde produced nitrogen oxides in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood to result in degradation to the [[ozone layer]] at the [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] altitudes it cruised.<ref name= 'emissions'>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5233.70 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;270/5233/70 |title= Emission Measurements of the Concorde Supersonic Aircraft in the Lower Stratosphere |author=Fahey, D.

The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible.<ref name= 'emissions'/>
David W. Fahey, of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], found that to produce a drop in stratospheric ozone of 1 to 2% would require a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft to be operated. Dr. Fahey stated that this would not be a limiting factor for further [[supersonic transport]] development.<ref>[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-10-08/news/1995281022_1_ozone-sulfur-exhaust-particles "Increase in supersonic jets could be threat to ozone U-2 plane trails Concorde, studies exhaust particles."] ''Baltimore Sun,'' October 8, 1995.</ref>

Concorde’s technical leap forward boosted the public’s understanding of conflicts between technology and the environment as well as awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/cjel5&div=9&id=&page= |title= Decision Analysis in Environmental Decisionmaking: Improving the Concorde Balance |first= Jon |last= Anderson |publisher=''HeinOnline,'' 1978 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> In France, the use of [[noise barrier|acoustic fencing]] alongside [[TGV]] tracks might not have been achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=''Environmental Science and Engineering,'' November 2001 |url= http://www.esemag.com/1101/1101ed.html |title= Train à grande vitesse causes distress}}{{dead link |date=July 2011}}</ref> In the UK, the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]] has issued [[Tranquillity#Mapping tranquillity|tranquillity maps]] since 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cpre.org.uk/campaigns/landscape/tranquillity/national-and-regional-tranquillity-maps |title= National and regional tranquillity maps |publisher=''Campaign to Protect Rural England'' |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>
