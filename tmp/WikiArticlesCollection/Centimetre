A '''centimetre''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|International spelling]] as used by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]; symbol '''cm''') or '''centimeter''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|American spelling]]) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[length]] in the [[metric system]], equal to one hundredth of a [[metre]], which is the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[SI base unit|base unit]] of length. Centi is the [[SI prefix]] for a factor of {{nowrap|10<sup>&minus;2</sup>}}.<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter3/prefixes.html BIPM - SI prefixes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Hence a centimetre can be written as {{nowrap|1{{e|&minus;2}}&nbsp;m}}, {{nowrap|10{{e|&minus;3}}&nbsp;m}} ([[engineering notation]]) or {{nowrap|1E&minus;2&nbsp;m}} ([[Scientific notation#E notation|scientific E notation]]) — meaning {{nowrap|10&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]}} or {{nowrap|1&nbsp;m/100}} respectively.  The centimetre was the base unit of length in the now deprecated [[centimetre-gram-second]] (CGS) system of units.

Though for many physical quantities, [[SI prefix]]es for factors of 10<sup>3</sup>—like ''milli-'' and ''kilo-''—are often preferred by technicians, the centimetre remains a practical unit of length for many everyday measurements. A centimetre is approximately the width of the fingernail of an adult person (between 3/8 [[inch|in]] and 7/16 inch on an English inch ruler). 

==Equivalence to other units of length==

1 centimetre is ''[[equal]]'' to:
* 10 millimetres
* 0.01 metre, which can be represented by [[1 E-2 m|1.00 E-2 m]] (1 metre is equal to 100 centimetres)
* about 0.393700787401575 [[inch]] (1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimetres) <ref>[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Inch.html Inch - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

1 cubic centimetre is equal to 1 [[litre|millilitre]], under the current [[SI]] system of units.

==Uses of centimetre==
In addition to its use in the measurement of [[length]], the centimetre is used:
* sometimes, to report the level of rainfall as measured by a [[rain gauge]] <ref>[http://www.weathershack.com/education/rain-measurement.html Rain Measurement, Rain Gauge, Wireless Rain Gauge, Rain Gage, Rain Gauge Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* in the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS system]], the centimetre is used to measure [[capacitance]], where 1&nbsp;cm of capacitance = <math>1.113 \times 10^{-12}</math> [[Farad]] <ref>[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Capacitance.html Capacitance - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* in  maps, centimetres are used to make conversions from map scale to real world scale (kilometres)
* to represent second moment of areas (cm<sup>4</sup>)
* as the inverse of the '''kayser''', a CGS unit, and thus a non-SI metric unit of [[wavenumber]]:  1 kayser=1 wave/centimetre; or, more generally, (wavenumber in kaysers)=1/([[wavelength]] in centimetres).

==Unicode symbols==
For the purposes of compatibility with [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korea]]n ([[CJK]]) characters, [[Unicode]] has symbols for:<ref>[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3300.pdf] CJK Compatibility excerpt from The Unicode Standard, Version 4.1.</ref>
* centimetre (㎝) – code 339D
* square centimetre (㎠) – code 33A0
* cubic centimetre (㎤) – code 33A4

They are mostly used only with East Asian fixed-width [[CJK]] fonts, because they are equal in size to one Chinese character.
