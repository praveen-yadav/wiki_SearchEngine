A '''bomber''' is a [[military aircraft]] designed to attack ground and sea targets, by dropping [[Aerial bomb|bomb]]s on them, firing [[aerial torpedo|torpedoes]] at them, or&nbsp;– in recent years&nbsp;– by launching [[cruise missile]]s at them.

===Strategic===
{{further|Carpet bombing|Strategic bomber}}
[[Strategic bombing]] is done by [[heavy bomber]]s primarily designed for long-range bombing missions against [[strategic target]]s such as supply bases, bridges, factories, shipyards, and cities themselves, in order to diminish the enemy's ability to wage war by limiting access to resources through crippling infrastructure or reducing industrial output. Current examples include the strategic [[nuclear bomb|nuclear-armed]] [[strategic bomber]]s: [[B-2 Spirit]], [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-95]] 'Bear', [[Tupolev Tu-22M]] 'Backfire'; historically notable examples are the: [[Gotha G.IV]], [[Avro Lancaster]], [[Heinkel He-111]], [[Junkers Ju 88]], [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]], [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]], [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], and [[Tupolev Tu-16]] 'Badger'.

===Tactical===
{{further|Aerial interdiction|Attack aircraft}}
[[Tactical bombing]], aimed at countering enemy military activity and in supporting offensive operations, is typically assigned to smaller aircraft operating at shorter ranges, typically near the troops on the ground or against enemy shipping. This role is filled by [[tactical bomber]] class, which crosses and blurs with various other aircraft categories: [[light bomber]]s, [[medium bomber]]s, [[dive bomber]]s, [[interdictor]]s, [[fighter-bomber]]s, [[attack aircraft]], [[multirole combat aircraft]], and others. Current examples: [[F-15E Strike Eagle]], [[F/A-18 Hornet]], [[Sukhoi Su-27]], [[Xian JH-7]], Dassault-Breguet [[Mirage 2000]], and the [[Panavia Tornado]]; historical examples: [[Ilyushin Il-2]] ''Shturmovik'', [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]], [[Hawker Typhoon]], [[McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] and [[Mikoyan MiG-27]].

==History==
{{anchor|World War I}}The first use of an air-dropped bomb (actually a hand grenade) was carried out by Italian Lieutenant [[Giulio Gavotti]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Libya 1911: How an Italian pilot began the air war era|date=10 May 2011|first=Alan|last=Johnston|publisher=BBC News|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13294524|accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> during the [[Italo-Turkish War|1911 Italo-Turkish war in Libya]], although his plane was not designed for the task of bombing, and his improvised attack had little impact. 

===The first bombers===
[[File:Bristol two seater.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bristol T.B.8]], first purpose-built British bomber, 1913.]]
The first heavier-than-air aircraft purposely designed for bombing were the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Caproni Ca 30]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Bristol T.B.8]], both of 1913.<ref name= "Aerial">{{cite book|pages=9–10|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kr2Gc7btCxEC&pg=PA9|title=Aerial Interdiction: Air Power and the Land Battle in Three American Wars|isbn=978-0-7881-1966-8|author1=Mark|date=1995-07}}</ref> The Bristol T.B.8 was an early [[United Kingdom|British]] single [[Piston engine|engined]] [[biplane]] built by the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]]. They were fitted with a prismatic [[Bombsight]] in the front [[cockpit]] and a cylindrical bomb carrier in the lower forward fuselage capable of carrying twelve 10&nbsp;lb (4.5&nbsp;kg) bombs, which could be dropped singly or as a salvo as required.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Mason, Francis K|title=The British Bomber since 1914|publisher=Putnam Aeronautical Books|location=London|year=1994|isbn=0-85177-861-5}}</ref>

The aircraft was purchased for use both by the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] and the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC), and three T.B.8s, that were being displayed in [[Paris]] during December 1913 fitted with bombing equipment, were sent to France following the outbreak of war. Under the command of [[Charles Rumney Samson]], a bombing attack on [[Germany|German]] gun batteries at [[Middelkerke]], [[Belgium]] was executed on 25 November 1914.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Michael J.

[[File:Caproni Ca.32(300hp-Ca.2) with Gianni Caproni on board.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caproni Ca.3]], an Italian World War I heavy bomber, 1915.]]
The  Caproni Ca 30 was built by [[Gianni Caproni]] in [[Italy]]. It was a twin-boom [[biplane]] with three 67&nbsp;kW (80&nbsp;hp) [[Gnome rotary engine]]s and first flew in October [[1914 in aviation|1914]]. Test flights revealed power to be insufficient and the engine layout unworkable, and Caproni soon adopted a more conventional approach. The improved design was bought by the [[Italian Army]] and it was delivered in quantity from August [[1915 in aviation|1915]].

While mainly used as a [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]], Avro 504s were also briefly used as bombers at the start of the [[World War I|First World War]] by the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) when they were used for raids on the German airship sheds.<ref>Mason, Francis K.

===Strategic bombing===
Bombing raids and interdiction operations were mainly carried out by French and British forces during the War as the [[Luftstreitkräfte|German air arm]] was forced to concentrate its resources on a defensive strategy. Notably, bombing campaigns formed a part of the British offensive at the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915, with [[Royal Flying Corps]] squadrons attacking German railway stations in an attempt to hinder the logistical supply of the [[German army]]. The early, improvised attempts at bombing that characterized the early part of the war slowly gave way to a more organized and systematic approach to strategic and tactical bombing, pioneered by various air power strategists of the [[Entente]], especially Major [[Hugh Trenchard]]; he was the first to advocate that there should be "...sustained  [strategic bombing] attacks with a view to interrupting the enemy's railway communications...in conjunction with the main operations of the Allied Armies."<ref name="Aerial"/> 
[[File:Handley Page O-400.jpg|thumb|British [[Handley Page Type O]], 1918.]]

When the war started, bombing was very crude (hand-held bombs were thrown over the side) yet by the end of the war long-range bombers equipped with complex mechanical bombing computers were being built, designed to carry large loads to destroy enemy industrial targets. The most important bombers used in WWI were the French [[Breguet 14]], British [[de Havilland DH-4]], German [[Albatros C.III]] and Russian [[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets]]. The [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets]], was the first four-engine bomber to equip a dedicated strategic bombing unit during [[World War I]]. This heavy bomber was unrivaled in the early stages of the war, as the Central Powers had no comparable aircraft until much later.

Long range bombing raids were carried out at night by multi-engined [[biplane]]s such as the [[Gotha G.IV]] (whose name was synonymous with all multi-engine German bombers) and later the [[Handley Page Type O]]; the majority of bombing was done by single-engined biplanes with one or two crew-members flying short distances to attack enemy lines and immediate hinterland. As the effectiveness of a bomber was dependent on the weight and accuracy of its bombload, ever larger bombers were developed starting in WWI, while considerable money was spent developing suitable bombsights.

===World War II===

With engine power as a major limitation, combined with the desire for accuracy and other operational factors, bomber designs tended to be tailored to specific roles. By the start of the war this included:

* [[dive bomber]] - ''specially strengthened for vertical diving attacks for greater accuracy.''
* [[light bomber]], [[medium bomber]] and [[heavy bomber]] - ''subjective definitions based on size.''
* [[torpedo bomber]] - ''specialized aircraft armed with torpedoes.''
* [[ground attack aircraft]] - ''aircraft used against targets on a battlefield such as troop or tank concentrations. A further specialized form was the anti-tank aircraft.''
* [[night bomber]] - ''specially equipped to operate at night when opposing defences are limited.''
* [[Maritime patrol aircraft|maritime patrol]] - ''long range bombers that were used against enemy shipping, particularly submarines.'' 

Bombers are not intended to attack other aircraft although most were fitted with defensive weapons. World War II saw the beginning of the widespread use of high speed bombers which dispensed with defensive weapons to be able to attain higher speed, such as with the [[de Havilland Mosquito]], a philosophy that continued with many Cold War bombers.

Some smaller designs have been used as the basis for [[night fighter]]s, and a number of fighters, such as the [[Hawker Hurricane]] were used as ground attack aircraft, replacing earlier conventional light bombers that proved unable to defend themselves while carrying a useful bombload.

===Cold War===

[[File:Avro Vulcan Bomber RAF.JPEG|thumb|left|The [[Avro Vulcan]] was part of the [[RAF]] [[V bomber]] force]]
At the start of the Cold War, bombers were the only means of carrying [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear]] weapons to enemy targets, and had the role of [[deterrence theory|deterrence]]. With the advent of guided air to air missiles, bombers needed to avoid interception. High speed and high altitude flying became a means of evading detection and attack. Designs such as the [[English Electric Canberra]] could fly faster or higher than contemporary fighters. When surface to air missiles became capable of hitting high flying bombers, bombers were flown at low altitudes to evade radar detection and interception.

Once "stand off" nuclear weapon designs were developed, bombers did not need to pass over the target to make an attack; they could fire and turn away to escape the blast. Nuclear strike aircraft were generally finished in bare metal or [[anti-flash white]] to minimize absorption of [[thermal radiation]] from the [[Effects of nuclear explosions|flash]] of a [[nuclear explosion]].

The need to drop conventional bombs remained in conflicts with non-nuclear powers, such as the [[Vietnam War]] or [[Malayan Emergency]].

The development of large strategic bombers stagnated in the later part of the Cold War because of spiraling costs and the development of the [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) – which was felt to have similar deterrent value while being impossible to intercept. Because of this, the United States Air Force [[XB-70 Valkyrie]] program was cancelled in the early 1960s; the later [[B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]] and [[B-2 Spirit]] aircraft entered service only after protracted political and development problems. Their high cost meant that few were built and the 1950s-designed B-52s remained in use into the 21st century. Similarly, the Soviet Union used the intermediate-range [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Tu-22M]] 'Backfire'in the 1970s, but their [[Mach number|Mach 3]] bomber project stalled. The Mach 2 [[Tu-160|Tu-160 'Blackjack']] was built only in tiny numbers, leaving the 1950s Tupolev Tu-16 and [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tu-95]] 'Bear' heavy bombers to continue being used into the 21st century.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] strategic bombing force largely came to an end when the [[V bomber]] force was phased out; the last of which left service in 1983. The French [[Mirage IV]] bomber version was retired in 1996, although the Mirage 2000N and the Rafale have taken on this role. The only other nation that fields strategic bombing forces is the [[People's Republic of China]], which has a number of [[Xian H-6]]s.

===Modern era===

In modern air forces, the distinction between bombers, fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones that ''look'' like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Indeed, the design qualities that make an effective low-level attack aircraft make for a distinctly inferior air superiority fighter, and vice versa. Conversely, many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks,' despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations.

Plans in the U.S. and Russia for successors to the current strategic bomber force remain only paper projects, and political and funding pressures suggest that they are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. In the U.S., current plans call for the existing USAF bomber fleet to remain in service until the mid-to-late 2020s, with the first [[2018 Bomber|possible replacements]] becoming operational in 2018.<ref name="usaf new bomber requirements">{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/news/defence/air/jdw/jdw071018_1_n.shtml|title=USAF may seek supersonic and unmanned capabilities for bomber|accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref> After this bomber the U.S. is also thinking of another [[2037 Bomber|bomber in 2037]]. The 2018 bomber will be made in small quantities as it will be a transition aircraft for this 2037 bomber. The 2018 bomber was, however, required to provide an answer to the fifth generation defense systems (such as [[SA-21 Growler]]s, [[bistatic radar]] and [[Active Electronically Scanned Array]] radar). Also, it was chosen to be able to stand against rising superpowers and other countries with semi-advanced military capability. Finally, a third reason was long-term air support for areas with a low threat level (Iraq, Afghanistan). The latter was referred to as close air support for the global [[war on terror]] (CAS for GWOT). The 2018 bomber would thus be able to stay for extended periods on a same location (called persistence).<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/06/12/214539/speed-bump-usaf-sets-modest-goals-for-new-bomber.html Persistence in 2018 bomber]</ref>
