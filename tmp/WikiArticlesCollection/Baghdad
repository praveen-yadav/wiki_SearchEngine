'''Baghdad''' ({{lang-ar|بغداد}} ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|Baġdād}}'', <small>[[Iraqi Arabic|Iraqi]] pronunciation:</small> {{IPA-ar|bɐʁˈd̪ɑːd̪|}}) is the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[Iraq|Republic of Iraq]], as well as the coterminous [[Baghdad Province]]. The population of Baghdad, as of 2011, is approximately 7,216,040, making it the largest city in Iraq,<ref name=population>Estimates of total population differ substantially. The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] gives a 2001 population of 4,950,000, the [[Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties|2006 Lancet Report]] states a population of 7,216,050 in 2011.

Located along the [[Tigris|Tigris River]], the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Within a short time of its inception, Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center for the [[Islamic world]]. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions (e.g. [[House of Wisdom]]), garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the "Center of Learning". Throughout the [[High Middle Ages]], Baghdad was considered to be the largest city in the world with an estimated population of 1,200,000 people.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities_throughout_history#cite_note-27 |title= List of largest cities throughout history |publisher=Wikipedia}}</ref> The city was largely [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destroyed]] at the hands of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state (formerly the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]) in 1938, Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of [[Arab culture]].

In contemporary times, the city has often faced severe infrastructural damage, most recently due to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the subsequent [[Iraq War]] that lasted until December 2011. In recent years, the city has been frequently subjected to [[Iraqi insurgency|insurgency]] attacks. Though the nation continues to work toward rebuilding and reconciliation, as of 2012, Baghdad continues to be listed as one of the least hospitable places in the world to live,<ref>{{cite news | title=What city has world's best quality of life? | newspaper=CNN | author=Inocencio, Ramy | date=4 December 2012 | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/04/business/global-city-quality-life/index.html}}</ref> and was ranked by [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] as the worst of 221 major cities as measured by quality-of-life.<ref>http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21569077-one-africas-most-miserable-countries-looks-unstable-ever-brink The Central African Republic: On the brink</ref>

==Toponym==
The name Baghdad is pre-Islamic and its origins are under some dispute. Some say it comes from an Aramaic phrase that means "sheep enclosure". Others contend that the word comes from ancient [[Persian language|Persian]] باغ ''bagh'' meaning God, and داد ''dad'' meaning gift. The name has been found as ''Baghdadu'' on [[Assyrian cuneiform]] records of the 9th century BC, and on Babylonian bricks bearing the Royal Seal of King [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (6th century BC).<ref>http://www.atlastours.net/iraq/baghdad.html</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2012}} However it is related to previous settlements, which did not have any political or commercial power.

When the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliph]], [[al-Mansur]], founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name Madinat al-Salaam or ''City of Peace''. This was the official name on coins, weights, and other official usage, although the common people continued to use the old name.<ref name="ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟">{{cite web|url=http://seenjeem.maktoob.com/question?category_id=4&level=L2&question_id=9510 |title=ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟ |publisher=Seenjeem.maktoob.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref><ref name="Egabat.google.com">{{cite web|url=http://egabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74 |title=ما معنى (بغداد)؟ - تمت الإجابة عنه - Google إجابات |publisher=Egabat.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> By the 11th century, "Baghdad" became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.

There are several rival theories as to the etymology of the specific name Baghdad. The most widely accepted among these is that the name is a [[Middle Persian]]<ref>http://admin.iraqupdates.net/p_articles.php/article/35631</ref><ref>http://www.blackanthem.com/News/Fact_Sheets/Baghdad_Iraq10693.shtml</ref><ref>http://persiangulfstudies.com/en/index.asp?P=NEWS2&Nu=45</ref><ref>http://islam.about.com/cs/history/a/aa040703a.htm</ref><ref>http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baghdad-iranian-connection-1-pr-Mongol</ref><ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=rezD7rvuf9YC&pg=PA563&dq=%22Baghdad+name+middle+persian%22&hl=en&ei=eJ22Td_1OZSL4gaA_LTQDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CFQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref><ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=i-4WhilzYkQC&pg=PA33&dq=%22Baghdad+godgiven%22&hl=en&ei=Ep62TfPrM4i74QaMwsncDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> compound of ''Bag'' "god" and ''dād'' "given", translating to "God-given" or "God's gift", from which comes [[Persian language|Modern Persian]] ''{{transl|fa|Baɣdād}}''. This in turn can be traced to [[Old Persian]].<ref name="Strange pg 10">Guy Le Strange, "Baghdad During the Abbasid Caliphate from Contemporary Arabic and Persian", pg 10</ref>
A less probable guess is the [[Persian language|Persian]] compound ''[[Bagh (garden)|bāğ]]'' "garden" and ''dād'' "fair", translating to "The fair garden".<ref name="ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟"/><ref name="Egabat.google.com"/>

==History==
{{Main|History of Baghdad}}
{{see also|Timeline of Baghdad history}}

=== Foundation ===
After the fall of the first Muslim dynasty, that of the Umayyads the victorious Abbasid rulers wanted their own capital. Choosing a site north of the Persian capital of [[Ctesiphon]], on 30 July 762,<ref>{{cite book|last=Corzine|first=Phyllis|title=The Islamic Empire|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|pages=68–69}}</ref> the [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] commissioned the construction of the city and it was built under the supervision of the [[Barmakids]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Times History of the World |publisher=Times Books |location=London |year=2000 |isbn= }}</ref> Mansur believed that Baghdad was the perfect city to be the capital of the Islamic empire under the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]]. Mansur loved the site so much he is quoted saying, "This is indeed the city that I am to found, where I am to live, and where my descendants will reign afterward".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wiet |first=Gastron |title=Baghdad: Metropolis of the Abbasid Caliphate |location= |publisher=Univ. of Oklahoma Press |year=1971 |isbn= }}</ref>

The city's growth was helped by its location, which gave it control over strategic and trading routes, along the Tigris. A reason why Baghdad provided an excellent location was the abundance of water and the dry climate. Water exists on both north and south ends of the city gates, allowing all households to have a plentiful supply, which was very uncommon during this time.

[[File:Baghdad-Zumurrud-Khaton.jpg|thumb|upright|Zumurrud Khaton tomb in Baghdad (built in 1202&nbsp;AD), photo of 1932.]]
Baghdad eclipsed [[Ctesiphon]], the capital of the [[Sassanid empire|Persian Empire]], which was located some {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast. Today, all that remains of Ctesiphon is the shrine town of [[Salman Pak]], just to the south of Greater Baghdad. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed [[Seleucia]], the first capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. [[Seleucia]] had earlier replaced the city of [[Babylon]].

In its early years, the city was known as a deliberate reminder of an expression in the [[Qur'an]], when it refers to [[Paradise]].<ref>Wiet, pg. 13</ref> It took four years to build (764-768). Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists from around the world to come together and draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers came to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city.<ref>{{cite book|last=Corzine|first=Phyllis|title=The Islamic Empire|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|page=69}}</ref>  July was chosen as the starting time because two Astrologers, [[Naubakht|Naubakht Ahvazi]] and [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], believed that the city should be built under the sign of the lion, [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].<ref>Wiet, pg. 12</ref> Leo is associated with fire and symbolises productivity, pride, and expansion.

The bricks used to make the city were {{convert|18|in|mm}} on all four sides. [[Abū Ḥanīfa]] was the counter of the bricks and he developed a canal, which brought water to the work site for the use of both human consumption and the manufacturing of the bricks. Marble was also used to make buildings throughout the city, and marble steps led down to the river's edge.

The basic framework of the city consists of two large semicircles about {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter. The city was designed as a circle about {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, leading it to be known as the "Round City". The original design shows as single ring of residential and commercial structures along the inside of the city walls, but the final construction added another ring inside the first.<ref>http://islamicceramics.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/Abbasid/baghdad.htm</ref>  Within the city there were many parks, gardens, villas, and promenades.<ref>"Yakut: Baghdad under the Abbasids, c. 1000CE"</ref>  In the center of the city lay the [[mosque]], as well as headquarters for guards. The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown. The circular design of the city was a direct reflection of the traditional [[Persia]]n [[Sasanian]] [[urban planning|urban design]]. The Sasanian city of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Gur]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]], built 500&nbsp;years before Baghdad, is nearly identical in its general circular design, radiating avenues, and the government buildings and temples at the centre of the city. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.

===The surrounding walls===
The four surrounding walls of Baghdad were named [[Kufa]], [[Basra]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and [[Damascus]]; named because their gates pointed in the directions of these destinations. The distance between these gates was a little less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}. Each gate had double doors that were made of iron; the doors were so heavy it took several men to open and close them. The wall itself was about 44&nbsp;m thick at the base and about 12&nbsp;m  thick at the top. Also, the wall was 30&nbsp;m  high, which included [[merlon]]s, a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by [[embrasure]]s. This wall was surrounded by another wall with a thickness of 50&nbsp;m. The second wall had towers and rounded merlons, which surrounded the towers. This outer wall was protected by solid [[glacis]], which is made out of bricks and [[quicklime]]. Beyond the outer wall was a water-filled moat.

====''Golden Gate Palace''====
In the middle of Baghdad, in the central square was the Golden Gate Palace. The Palace was the residence of the caliph and his family. In the central part of the building was a green dome that was 39&nbsp;m high. Surrounding the palace was an [[esplanade]], a waterside building, in which only the caliph could come riding on horseback. In addition, the palace was near other mansions and officer's residences. Near the Gate of Syria a building served as the home for the guards. It was made of brick and marble. The palace governor lived in the latter part of the building and the commander of the guards in the front. In 813, after the death of caliph [[Al-Amin]] the palace was no longer used as the home for the caliph and his family.<ref>Wiet, pg. 15</ref>
The roundness points to the fact that it was based on [[Arabic script]].<ref>See:
*{{Cite book|title=Islam Art and Architecture|first=Markus|last=Hattstein|coauthors=Peter Delius|year=2000|page=96|isbn=3-8290-2558-0|publisher=Könemann|location=Cologne}}
*''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', [[Columbia University]], p.413.</ref> The two designers who were hired by [[Al-Mansur]] to plan the city's design were [[Naubakht]], a Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], a Jew from [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], [[Iran]].<ref name="ref2">{{cite book|title=Islamic Science and Engineering|first=Donald R.|last=Hill|year=1994|page=10|isbn=0-7486-0457-X|publisher=Edinburgh Univ. Press|location=Edinburgh}}</ref>

====The Abbasids and the round city====
[[File:Baghdad 150 to 300 AH.gif|300px|thumb|The [[Round city of Baghdad]] between 767 and 912&nbsp;AD]]
The Abbasid Caliphate was based on their being the descendants of the uncle of [[Muhammad]] and being part of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe. They used [[Shi'a]] resentment, [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]ian movement, and appeals to the ambitions and traditions of the newly conquered [[Persian people|Persian]] aristocracy to overthrow the [[Umayyads]].<ref>Atlas of the Medieval World pg. 78</ref>
The Abbasids sought to combine the hegemony of the [[Arab]] tribes with the imperial, court, ceremonial, and administrative structures of the Persians. The Abbasids considered themselves the inherittures and the need of Mansur to place the capital in a place that was representative of Arab-Islamic identity by building the [[House of Wisdom]], where ancient texts were translated from their original language, such as Greek, to Arabic. Mansur is credited with the "[[Translation Movement]]" for this. Further, Baghdad is also near the ancient Sassanid imperial seat of [[Ctesiphon]] on the Tigris River.

===A centre of learning (8th to 13th centuries)===
{{Further|Islamic Golden Age}}
Within a generation of its founding, Baghdad became a hub of [[learning]] and [[commerce]]. The [[House of Wisdom]] was an establishment dedicated to the translation of [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Middle Persian]] and [[Syriac]] works. Scholars headed to Baghdad from all over the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], facilitating the introduction of Persian, Greek and [[Science and technology in ancient India|Indian science]] into the Arabic and Islamic world at that time. Baghdad was likely the [[Historical urban community sizes|largest city in the world]] from shortly after its foundation until the 930s, when it was tied by [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title=Largest Cities Through History |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>
Several estimates suggest that the city contained over a million inhabitants at its peak.<ref>Matt T. Rosenberg, [http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm ''Largest Cities Through History''.]</ref> Many of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' tales are set in Baghdad during this period.

By the 10th century, the city's population was between 1.2&nbsp;million<ref name=Modelski>[[George Modelski]], ''World Cities: –3000 to 2000'', Washington, D.C.: FAROS 2000, 2003.

Salkin|first=K. A. Berney, Paul E. Schellinger|year=1996|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|page=116|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Baghdad's early meteoric growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the [[Caliphate]], including relocations of the capital to [[Samarra]] (during 808–819 and 836–892), the loss of the western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the [[Iran]]ian [[Buwayhid]]s (945–1055) and [[Seljuk Turks]] (1055–1135).

The [[Seljuks]] were a clan of the [[Oghuz Turks]] from the Central Asia that converted to the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam. In 1040, they destroyed the [[Ghaznavids]], taking over their land and in 1055, [[Tughril Beg]], the leader of the Seljuks, took over Baghdad. The Seljuks expelled the [[Buyid dynasty]] of Shiites that ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad. They ruled as [[Sultans]] in the name of the Abbasid caliphs (they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime). Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs.<ref>Atlas of the Medieval World pg. 170</ref>

[[File:DiezAlbumsFallOfBaghdad.jpg|thumb|left|Conquest of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258]]
In 1058, Baghdad was captured by the [[Fatimids]] under the Turkish general [[Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri]], an adherent of the [[Ismailis]] along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh.<ref>Virani, Shafique N. ''The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 6.</ref> Not long before the arrival of the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph [[Al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustansir]] to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid ''[[da'i]]'', [[al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi]], had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking [[Mosul|Mawṣil]], [[Wasit, Iraq|Wāsit]] and [[Kufa]]. Soonafter,<ref name="Daftary, Farhad 1990">Daftary, Farhad. ''The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 205-206.</ref> by December 1058, a Shi'i ''[[adhān]]'' (call to prayer) was implemented in Baghdad and a ''[[khutbah]]'' (sermon) was delivered in the name of the Fatimid Imam-Caliph.<ref name="Daftary, Farhad 1990"/> Despite his Shi'i inclinations, Al-Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi'is alike, for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a common factor.<ref>Daftary, Farhad. ''The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 206.</ref>

On 10 February 1258, Baghdad was captured by the [[Mongols]] led by [[Hulegu]], a grandson of Chingiz Khan ([[Genghis Khan]]), during the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|siege of Baghdad]].<ref>[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities], George Modelski</ref> Many quarters were ruined by fire, siege, or looting. The Mongols massacred most of the city's inhabitants, including the caliph [[Al-Musta'sim]], and destroyed large sections of the city. The [[canal]]s and [[Levee|dykes]] forming the city's [[irrigation]] system were also destroyed. The sack of Baghdad put an end to the Abbasid Caliphate, a blow from which the Islamic civilization never fully recovered.

At this point, Baghdad was ruled by the [[Il-Khanids]], the [[Mongol]] rulers of [[Iran]]. In 1401, Baghdad was again sacked, by the Central Asian Turkic conqueror [[Timur]] ("Tamerlane").<ref>Ian Frazier, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/25/050425fa_fact4?currentPage=5 Annals of history: Invaders: Destroying Baghdad], [[The New Yorker]] 25 April 2005. p.5</ref> When his forces took Baghdad, he spared almost no one, and ordered that each of his soldiers bring back two severed human heads.<ref>[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav042806.shtml New Book Looks at Old-Style Central Asian Despotism], EurasiaNet Civil Society, Elizabeth Kiem, April 28, 2006</ref> It became a provincial capital controlled by the Mongol [[Jalayirid]] (1400–1411), Turkic [[Kara Koyunlu]] (1411–1469), Turkic [[White Sheep Turkmen|Ak Koyunlu]] (1469–1508), and the Iranian [[Safavid]] (1508–1534) dynasties.

===Ottoman era (16th to 19th centuries)===
{{see also|Baghdad Eyalet|Baghdad Vilayet}}
In 1534, Baghdad was captured by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. Under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Baghdad fell into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and Iranian Safavids, which did not accept the Sunni control of the city. [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639)|Between 1623 and 1638]], it returned to Iranian rule before falling back into Ottoman hands.

Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the [[plague (disease)|plague]] and [[cholera]],<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=F2TGkO7G43oC&pg=PA99&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Fertile Crescent, 1800-1914: a documentary economic history]''".

ISBN 0-521-57455-2</ref>

For a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East. The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century under a [[Mamluk dynasty of Iraq|Mamluk]] government. Direct Ottoman rule was reimposed by [[Ali Ridha Pasha]] in 1831. From 1851 to 1852 and from 1861 to 1867, Baghdad was governed, under the Ottoman Empire by [[Mehmed Namık Pasha]].<ref>Cetinsaya, Gokhan. ''Ottoman Administration of Iraq, 1890–1908''. London and New York: Routledge, 2006.</ref> The [[Nuttall Encyclopedia]] reports the 1907 population of Baghdad as 185,000. Baghdad was also home to a substantial [[Iraqi Jews|Jewish]] community, which comprised over a quarter of the city's population.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:Baghdad LOC 13186.jpg|thumb|Baghdad in 1932]]

Baghdad and southern Iraq remained under Ottoman rule until 1917, when captured by the British during World War I. From 1920, Baghdad became the capital of the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]] and, after 1932, Baghdad was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. Iraq was given formal independence in 1932 and increased autonomy in 1946. The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950.

On 1 April 1941, members of the "Golden Square" and [[Rashid Ali]] staged [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|a coup in Baghdad]]. Rashid Ali installed a pro-[[Nazi Germany|German]] and pro-[[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] government to replace the pro-British government of [[Regent]] [['Abd al-Ilah|Abdul Ilah]]. On 31 May, after the resulting [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] and after Rashid Ali and his government had fled, the Mayor of Baghdad surrendered to British and Commonwealth forces.

On 14 July 1958, members of the [[Iraqi Army]], under [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]], [[14 July Revolution|staged a coup to topple the Kingdom of Iraq]]. King [[Faisal II]], former Prime Minister [[Nuri as-Said]], former Regent Prince [['Abd al-Ilah]], members of the royal family, and others were brutally killed during the coup. Many of the victim's bodies were then dragged through the streets of Baghdad.

During the 1970s, Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the [[price of petroleum]], Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including modern sewerage, water, and highway facilities were built during this period. However, the [[Iran–Iraq War]] of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted by [[Saddam Hussein]] to the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of missile attacks against Baghdad in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's continuous bombardments of Tehran's residential districts.

In 1991 and 2003, the [[Gulf War]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] caused [[Damage to Baghdad during the Iraq War|significant damage]] to Baghdad's [[transportation]], [[Electricity generation|power]], and sanitary infrastructure as the US-led coalition forces launched massive aerial assaults in the city in the two wars.

==Main sights==
Points of interest include the [[National Museum of Iraq]] whose priceless collection of artifacts was looted during the 2003 invasion, and the iconic Hands of Victory arches. Multiple Iraqi parties are in discussions as to whether the arches should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the [[Iraq National Library and Archive|National Library]] were destroyed under [[Saddam]]'s command.

===Baghdad Zoo===
{{Main|Baghdad Zoo}}

The [[Baghdad Zoo]] was the largest zoo in the Middle East. Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food invasion, [[South African]] [[Lawrence Anthony]] and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with [[donkey]]s they had bought locally.<ref name = "BBC radio 4, zoo">{{cite web

===Kadhimiya mosque===
{{main|Al-Kadhimiya Mosque}}

The Al-Kādhimiya Mosque is a shrine that is located in the Kādhimayn suburb of Baghdad, Iraq. It contains the tombs of the seventh Twelver Shīa Imām Musa al-Kadhim and the ninth Twelver Shīa Imām Muhammad at-Taqī al-Jawād. Many Shias travel to the mosque from far away places to commemorate.

==Geography==
[[File:Baghdad, Iraq.JPG|thumb|Astronaut view of Baghdad]]
The city is located on a vast plain bisected by the [[River Tigris]]. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called '[[Risafa]]' and the Western half known as '[[Karkh]]'. The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of [[alluvium|alluvial]] origin due to the periodic large floods which have occurred on the river.

===Climate===
Baghdad has a [[desert climate|subtropical arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') and is, in terms of maximum temperatures, one of the hottest cities in the world. In the summer from June to August, the average maximum temperature is as high as {{convert|44|°C|°F|abbr=on}} accompanied by blazing sunshine: rainfall has in fact been recorded on fewer than half a dozen occasions at this time of year and has never exceeded {{convert|1|mm|in|2}}.<ref>[http://climexp.knmi.nl/data/pa40650_yr.txt Monthly rainfall for Baghdad (WMO #40650)]</ref> Temperatures exceeding {{convert|50|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in the shade are by no means unheard of,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and even at night temperatures in summer are seldom below {{convert|24|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Because the [[humidity]] is very low (usually under 10%) due to Baghdad's distance from the marshy [[Persian Gulf]], [[dust storm]]s from the deserts to the west are a normal occurrence during the summer.

Winters boast mild days and variable nights. From December to February, Baghdad has maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|15.5|to|18.5|C|F}}, though highs above {{convert|70|F|C}} are not unheard of. Morning temperatures can be chilly: the average January low is {{convert|3.8|°C|°F|abbr=on}} but lows below freezing only occur a couple of times per year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Annual rainfall, almost entirely confined to the period from November to March, averages around {{convert|150|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, but has been as high as {{convert|338|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} and as low as {{convert|37|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://climexp.knmi.nl/data/tspa40650.txt Annual Rainfall Statistics for Baghdad (WMO #40650)]</ref> On January 11, 2008, light snow fell across Baghdad for the first time in memory.<ref>{{cite web|author=(AFP) – Jan 11, 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5huPkYk4bGVvo1Sa1tWeH-tgENiFw |title=Afp.google.com, First snow for 100 years falls on Baghdad |publisher=Afp.google.com |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:BagdhadFromTheISS.jpg|thumb|right|Baghdad as seen from the [[International Space Station]]]]
The city of Baghdad has 89 official neighbourhoods within 9 districts. These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centres for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S. controlled [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these. The process initially focused on the election of neighbourhood councils in the official neighbourhoods, elected by neighbourhood caucuses.

The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighbourhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbours to subsequent meetings. Each neighbourhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighbourhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbours to vote for them.

Once all 88 (later increased to 89) neighbourhood councils were in place, each neighbourhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighbourhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighbourhood's population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighbourhood, through the district, and up to the city council.

The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighbourhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada). As within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council.

The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February, 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected.

This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighbourhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people.

The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows:<ref>{{cite news |title=New troops to move into Iraq |url=http://images.usatoday.com/news/graphics/troop_surge/flash.swf |work=USA Today}}</ref>

===Reconstruction efforts===
{{further|Investment in post-invasion Iraq}}

Most [[Reconstruction of Iraq|Iraqi reconstruction]] efforts have been devoted to the restoration and repair of badly damaged urban infrastructure. More visible efforts at reconstruction through private development, like architect and urban designer [[Hisham N. Ashkouri]]'s [[Reconstruction of Iraq#The Proposed Baghdad Baghdad is mizz Renaissance Plan|Baghdad Renaissance Plan]] and the [[Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center]] have also been made.
<ref>[http://www.arcadd.com/baghdad-cbd.htm ARCADD]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref>

There are also plans to build a giant [[Ferris wheel]] akin to the [[London Eye]]. Iraq's Tourism Board also is seeking investors to develop a "romantic" island on the River Tigris in Baghdad that was once a popular honeymoon spot for newlywed Iraqis. The project would include a six-star hotel, spa, an 18-hole golf course and a country club. In addition, the go-ahead has been given to build numerous architecturally unique skyscrapers along the Tigris that would develop the city's financial centre in Kadhehemiah.<ref>{{cite web|author=3:48&nbsp;p.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26425911/ |title=Baghdad plans to build giant Ferris wheel |publisher=MSNBC |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{See also|Baghdad Arabic|Culture of Iraq}}
[[File:Iraqi National Orchestra.jpg|thumb|The [[Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra]], officially founded in 1959, performing a concert in [[Iraq]] in July 2007.]]

Baghdad has always played an important role in [[Arab cultural]] life and has been the home of noted writers, musicians and visual artists. Famous [[Arab]] poets and singers such as [[Nizar Qabbani]], [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Fairuz]], [[Salah Al-Hamdani]], [[Ilham al-Madfai]] and others wrote beautiful poems and sang for Baghdad.

The dialect of [[Baghdad Arabic|Arabic spoken in Baghdad]] today differs from that of other large urban centres in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Verseegh, ''The Arabic Language''). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sacks of the late [[Middle Ages]].

===Institutions===

[[File:Baghdad Convention Center inside.jpg|thumb|right|Many events are hosted at the Baghdad Convention Center]]
Some of the important cultural institutions in the city include:
*[[Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra]] – Rehearsals and performances were briefly interrupted during the [[Iraq War|Second Gulf War]], but have since returned to normal
*[[National Theater (Iraq)|National Theater]] – The theatre was looted during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], but efforts are underway to restore the theatre.<ref>[http://csmonitor.com/2003/0716/p01s04b-woiq.htm Five women confront a new Iraq | csmonitor.com]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref>

The live theatre scene received a boost during the 1990s, when UN [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theatres were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of [[Comedy|comedies]] and dramatic productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0102-04.htm |title=In Baghdad, Art Thrives As War Hovers |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=2003-01-02 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include [[The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad]] and the [[Institute of Fine Arts Baghdad]]. Baghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and relics of [[ancient civilization]]; many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after United States forces entered the city.

During the [[History of Iraq (2003–11)|2003 occupation of Iraq]], [[AFN Iraq]] ("Freedom Radio") broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called "Dijlah" (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the [[Jamia]] neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/03/africa/ME-GEN-Iraq-Media-Attacked.php |title=Gunmen storm independent radio station in latest attack against media in Iraq |work=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

==Sport==
Baghdad is home to some of the most successful [[Association football|football (soccer)]] teams in Iraq, the biggest being [[Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya]] (Airforce club), [[Al-Zawra'a SC|Al-Zawra'a]], [[Al-Shorta SC (Iraq)|Al-Shorta]] (Police), and [[Talaba SC|Talaba]] (Students). The largest stadium in Baghdad is [[Al-Shaab Stadium]], which was opened in 1966. Another, but much larger stadium, is still in the opening stages of construction.

The city has also had a strong tradition of [[horse racing]] ever since [[World War I]], known to Baghdadis simply as 'Races'. There are reports of pressures by the Islamists to stop this tradition due to the associated gambling.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
