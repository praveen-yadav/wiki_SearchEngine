{{MLB playoffs sidebar}}
In [[Major League Baseball]], the '''National League Championship Series''' ('''NLCS''') is a round in the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] that determines who wins the [[National League]] pennant and advances to [[Major League Baseball]]'s championship, the [[World Series]], facing the winner of the [[American League Championship Series]]. The reigning National League Champions are the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].

Prior to [[1969 in baseball|1969]], the National League champion (the "[[List of National League pennant winners|pennant winner]]") was determined by the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season. There were four ''ad hoc'' three-game playoff series due to ties under this formulation (in [[1946 in baseball|1946]], [[1951 in baseball|1951]], [[1959 in baseball|1959]] and [[1962 in baseball|1962]]). (The [[American League]] had to resolve a tie in [[1948 in baseball|1948]], but used a single-game playoff for that.)

A structured postseason series began in 1969, when both the National and American Leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners within each league played each other in a best-of-five series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In [[1985 in baseball|1985]], the format changed to best-of-seven.

The NLCS and ALCS, since the expansion to best-of-seven, are always played in a 2–3–2 format: games 1, 2, 6 and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has home field advantage, and Games 3, 4 and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. Home field advantage is given to the team that has the better record, with the exception that the team that made the postseason as the [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|Wild Card]] team cannot get home field advantage. From 1969 to 1993, home field advantage was alternated between divisions each year regardless of regular season record and from 1995 to 1997 home field advantage was predetermined before the season.

In [[1981 in baseball|1981]], a [[1981 National League Division Series|divisional series]] was held due to a split season caused by a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]].

In [[1994 in baseball|1994]], the league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and a wild-card team advancing to a best-of-five postseason round, the [[National League Division Series]] (NLDS). The winners of that round advance to the best-of-seven NLCS. The NLDS was first played in 1995 due to the cancellation of the 1994 postseason during another players' strike.

Every current National League franchise except the [[Washington Nationals]] has appeared in the NLCS at least once, although the Nationals appeared as the [[Montreal Expos]] in [[1981 National League Championship Series|1981]]. The [[Houston Astros]] made four NLCS appearances before moving to the [[American League]] in [[2013 Major League Baseball season|2013]].

As of the 2013 season, the Milwaukee Brewers are the only franchise to play in both the NLCS (in [[2011 National League Championship Series|2011]]) and the ALCS (in [[1982 ALCS|1982]]). No franchise has yet to win both the National and American Leagues Championship Series.

==Championship Trophy==
The [[Warren C. Giles Trophy]], named for the [[Warren Giles|president of the NL]] from 1951 to 1969, is awarded to the NLCS winner.<ref>{{cite new|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/20081016__Fantastic_feeling__for_Bill_Giles.html|title='Fantastic feeling' for Bill Giles,"|publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=Oct. 16, 2008|accessdate=Retrieved 2009-08-17}}</ref>

==Most Valuable Player Award==
:''See: [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award#National League winners]]''
A Most Valuable Player ([[MVP]]) award is given to the outstanding player in each series, though voters can consider performances made during the divisional series.  The MVP award has been given to a player on the losing team twice, in 1986 to Mike Scott of the Houston Astros and in 1987 to Jeff Leonard of the San Francisco Giants.

Although the National League began its LCS MVP award in 1977, the American League did not begin its LCS MVP award until 1980.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_lcs.jsp?feature=mvp League Championship Series Most Valuable Players] (MLB.com/News/Awards/History/ ).
