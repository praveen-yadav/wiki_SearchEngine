'''Dollar''' (often represented by the [[dollar sign|peso and dollar sign]] '''$''') is the name of several [[Currency|currencies]], including those of [[Australian dollar|Australia]], [[Belize dollar|Belize]], [[Brunei dollar|Brunei]], [[Canadian dollar|Canada]], [[Hong Kong dollar|Hong Kong]], [[Namibian Dollar|Namibia]], [[New Zealand dollar|New Zealand]], [[Singapore dollar|Singapore]], [[New Taiwan dollar|Taiwan]], the [[United States dollar|United States]], and previously [[Zimbabwean dollar|Zimbabwe]]. The U.S. dollar is the official currency of [[East Timor]], [[currency of Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Micronesia]], [[Palau]], and for banknotes, [[Panama]]. Generally, one dollar is divided into one hundred [[Cent (currency)|cents]].

==History==

On 15 January 1520, the [[kingdom of Bohemia]] began minting coins from silver mined locally in [[Joachimsthal]]. The coins were called "Joachimsthaler," which became shortened in common usage to ''[[thaler]]'' or ''taler''. The German name Joachimsthal literally means Joachim's valley or Joachim's dale.
This name found its way into other languages:  Czech ''[[tolar]]'', Hungarian [[tallér]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''(rigs) [[Norwegian rigsdaler|daler]]'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''(riks) [[Riksdaler|daler]]'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''dalur'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''(rijks)[[Dutch guilder|daalder or daler]]'', [[Ethiopian language|Ethiopian]] ''ታላሪ ("talari")'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''tallero'', [[Flemish language|Flemish]] ''daelder'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''Talar'', [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Dare'', as well as - via Dutch - into [[English language|English]] as ''dollar''.

A later Dutch coin depicting a lion was called the [[leeuwendaalder|leeuwendaler or leeuwendaalder]], literally 'lion daler'. The [[Dutch Republic]] produced these coins to accommodate its booming international trade. The leeuwendaler circulated throughout the [[Middle East]] and was imitated in several German and Italian cities. This coin was also popular in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and in the Dutch [[New Netherland|New Netherland Colony]] ([[New York]]). It was in circulation throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during the 17th and early 18th centuries and was popularly known as lion (or lyon) dollar.<ref>http://books.google.nl/books?id=0j6GvkVvAGsC&lpg=PA490&dq=New%20York%20leeuwendaalder&hl=nl&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q=thaler&f=false</ref><ref>http://coins.lakdiva.org/netherlands/1644_wes_lion_daalder_ag.html</ref> The modern American-English pronunciation of ''dollar'' is still remarkably close to the 17th century Dutch pronunciation of ''daler''.<ref name="etymologiebank.nl">http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/dollar</ref> Some well-worn examples circulating in the Colonies were known as "dog dollars".<ref>[http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Lion-Dollar.intro.html Lion Dollar — Introduction]</ref>

===Origins of the dollar sign===
{{Main|Dollar sign#Origin}}

The sign is first attested in business correspondence in the 1770s as a [[scribal abbreviation]] "p<sup>s</sup>", referring to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish American]] [[peso]],<ref>Lawrence Kinnaird (July 1976). [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0043-3810%28197607%297%3A3%3C253%3ATWFOR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4 "The Western Fringe of Revolution,"] ''[[The Western Historical Quarterly]]'' '''7(3)''', 259.</ref><ref>{{citation | journal = [[Popular Science]] | title = Origin of Dollar Sign is Traced to Mexico | year = 1930 | volume = 116 | issue = 2 | issn = 0161-7370 | page = 59 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=4ykDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#PPA59,M1}}</ref> that is, the "Spanish dollar" as it was known in British North America.  These late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century manuscripts show that the ''s'' gradually came to be written over the ''p'' developing a close equivalent to the "$" mark, and this new symbol was retained to refer to the American dollar as well, once this currency was adopted in 1785 by the United States.<ref>[[Florian Cajori]] ([1929]1993).

===Adoption by the United States===
{{Main|United States dollar}}

By the [[American Revolution]], Spanish dollars gained significance because they backed paper money authorized by the individual colonies and the [[Continental Congress]].<ref name = "nqteor"/> Common in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], Spanish dollars were even [[legal tender]] in one colony, [[Virginia]].

On April 2, 1792, U.S. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] reported to Congress the precise amount of silver found in [[Spanish milled dollar]] coins in common use in the States. As a result, the [[United States dollar]] was defined<ref name = "Act 1792">''Act of April 2, A.D. 1792 of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, Section 9''.</ref> as a unit of pure silver weighing 371 4/16th grains (24.057&nbsp;grams), or 416 grains of standard silver (standard silver being defined as 1,485 parts fine silver to 179 parts alloy).<ref name = "Act 1792 13">Section 13 of the Act.</ref> It was specified that the "money of account" of the United States should be expressed in those same "dollars" or parts thereof. Additionally, all lesser-denomination coins were defined as percentages of the dollar coin, such that a half-dollar was to contain half as much silver as a dollar, quarter-dollars would contain one-fourth as much, and so on.

In an act passed in January 1837, the dollar's alloy (amount of non-silver metal present) was set at 15%. Subsequent coins would contain the same amount of pure silver as previously, but were reduced in overall weight (to 412.25 grains). On February 21, 1853, the quantity of silver in the lesser coins was reduced, with the effect that their denominations no longer represented their silver content relative to dollar coins.

Various acts have subsequently been passed affecting the amount and type of metal in U.S. coins, so that today there is no legal definition of the term "dollar" to be found in U.S. statute.<ref name = "At Large">{{cite book | title = United States Statutes at Large}}</ref><ref name = "Yeoman">{{cite book | title = A Guide Book of United States Coins | first = RS | last = Yeoman}}</ref><ref name = "Ewart">{{cite book | title = Money — Ye shall have honest weights and measures | first = James E | last = Ewart}}</ref> Currently the closest thing to a definition is found in United States Code Title 31, Section 5116, paragraph b, subsection 2: "The Secretary [of the Treasury] '''shall sell silver''' under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate for at least $1.292929292 a fine troy ounce."

Silver was mostly removed from U.S. coinage by 1965 and the dollar became a free-floating [[fiat currency]] without a commodity backing defined in terms of real gold or silver. The [[United States Mint|US Mint]] continues to make silver $1-denomination coins, but these are not intended for general circulation.

===Usage in Great Britain===

There are many quotes in the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] referring to dollars as money. Coins known as "Thistle dollars" were in use in [[Scotland]] during the 16th and 17th century,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Handbook of the Coins of Great Britain and Ireland in the British Museum |author=Herbert Appold Grueber |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LESLAg3XguwC&pg=PA190&lpg=PA190&dq=thistle+dollar&source=bl&ots=PM985gd940&sig=D_IeSFxuPAu926hM5F53c58j4ag&hl=en&ei=lY7cTN7BCpO7hAe1ir3PAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=thistle%20dollar&f=false}}</ref> and use of the English word, and perhaps even the use of the coin, may have begun at the [[University of St Andrews]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This might be supported by a reference to the sum of "ten thousand dollars" in ''[[Macbeth]]'' (Act I, Scene II) (an [[anachronism]] because the real [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]], upon whom the play was based, lived in the 11th century).

In 1804, a British five-[[shilling]] piece, or [[Crown (British coin)|crown]], was sometimes called "dollar". It was an overstruck Spanish 8 [[Spanish real|real]] coin (the famous '[[piece of eight]]'), the original of which was known as a Spanish dollar. Large numbers of these 8-real coins were captured during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], hence their re-use by the [[Bank of England]]. They remained in use until 1811.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_value_of_an_1804_British_Dollar |title=What is the value of an 1804 British Dollar |publisher=Wiki.answers.com |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> During [[World War II]], when the U.S. dollar was (approximately) valued at 5 shillings, the half crown (2s 6d) became nicknamed a "half dollar" by US personnel in the UK.

===Usage elsewhere===

Chinese demand for silver in the 19th and early 20th centuries led several countries, notably the United Kingdom, United States and [[Japan]], to mint [[trade dollar]]s, which were often of slightly different weights from comparable domestic coinage. Silver dollars reaching China (whether Spanish, Trade, or other) were often stamped with Chinese characters known as "chop marks", which indicated that that particular coin had been assayed by a well-known merchant and determined genuine.

====Other national currencies called “dollar”====

Prior to 1873, the silver dollar circulated in many parts of the world, with a value in relation to the British gold [[British sovereign coin|sovereign]] of roughly $1 = 4s 2d (21p approx). As a result of the decision of the German Empire to stop minting silver [[thaler]] coins in 1871, in the wake of the [[Franco-Prussian war]], the worldwide price of silver began to fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silver-investor.com/charlessavoie/cs_3-29-05_monetarymadhouse.htm |title=Monetary Madhouse, Charles Savoie, 2005 |publisher=Silver-investor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> This resulted in the US [[Coinage Act (1873)]] which put the [[United States]] on to a '[[de facto]]' gold standard. [[Canada]] and [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] were already on the gold standard, and the result was that the value of the dollar in [[North America]] increased in relation to silver dollars being used elsewhere, particularly [[Latin America]] and the [[Far East]]. By 1900, value of silver dollars had fallen to 50 percent of gold dollars. Following abandonment of the gold standard by Canada in 1931, the [[Canadian dollar]] began to drift away from parity with the U.S. dollar. It returned to parity a few times, but since the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of fixed exchange rates that was agreed in 1944, the [[Canadian dollar]] has been floating against the US dollar. The silver dollars of [[Latin America]] and [[South East Asia]] began to diverge from each other as well during the course of the 20th century. The [[Straits dollar]] adopted a gold exchange standard in 1906 after it had been forced to rise in value against other silver dollars in the region. Hence, by 1935, when [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]] came off the [[silver standard]], the Straits dollar was worth 2s 4d (11.5p approx) [[Pound sterling|sterling]], whereas the [[Hong Kong dollar]] was worth only 1s 3d sterling (6p approx).

The term "dollar" has also been adopted by other countries for currencies which do not share a common history with other dollars. Many of these currencies adopted the name after moving from a [[£sd]]-based to a decimalized monetary system. Examples include the [[Australian dollar]], the [[New Zealand dollar]], the [[Jamaican dollar]], the [[Cayman Islands dollar]], the [[Fiji dollar]], the [[Namibian dollar]], the [[Rhodesian dollar]], the [[Zimbabwe dollar]], and the [[Solomon Islands dollar]].
*The ''[[Samoan tala|tala]]'' is based on the [[Samoan language|Samoan]] pronunciation of the word "dollar".
*The [[Slovenian tolar]] had the same etymological origin as dollar (that is, [[thaler]]).
