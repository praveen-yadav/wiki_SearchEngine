{{Community}}

The term '''community''' has two distinct commutative meanings: 1) Community can refer to a usually small, [[Level of analysis#Meso-level|social unit]] of any size that shares common [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. The term can also refer to the [[Nation|national community]] or [[international community]], and 2) in [[biology]], a community is a group of [[interacting]] [[life|living]] [[organism]]s sharing a populated [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

In [[human]] communities, [[intention|intent]], [[belief]], [[Natural resource|resources]], [[preference]]s, [[Need assessment|needs]], [[risk]]s, and a number of other conditions may be present and common, affecting the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.

Since the advent of the [[Internet]], the concept of community has less geographical limitation, as people can now gather virtually in an online community and share common interests regardless of physical location. Prior to the internet, virtual communities (like social or academic organizations) were far more limited by the constraints of available communication and transportation technologies.

The word "community" is derived from the [[Old French]] ''communité'' which is derived from the [[Latin]] ''[[communitas]]'' (''com'', "with/together" + ''munus'', "gift"), a broad term for fellowship or organized society.<ref>"community, n." OED Online. July 2009. [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50045241 Oxford University Press]</ref>
Some examples of community service are to help in church, tutoring, hospitals, etc.

==Perspectives from various disciplines==
===Sociology===
{{sociology}}

====Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft====
{{Main|Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft}}

German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] distinguished between two types of human association: ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (usually translated as "community") and ''[[Gesellschaft]]'' ("society" or "association"). In his 1887 work, ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Tönnies argued that ''Gemeinschaft'' is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a "unity of will."<ref>Tönnies, F. 1887. ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', p. 22.</ref> He added that [[family]] and [[kinship]] were the perfect expressions of ''Gemeinschaft'', but that other shared characteristics, such as place or belief, could also result in ''Gemeinschaft''. This paradigm of communal networks and shared social understanding has been applied to multiple cultures in many places throughout history.<ref>Messing, A. (2009). Panxenos: An outsider's sociology of self. ''Human Architecture'' 7.3, pp. 155-172. [http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20VII%203/Messing-FM.pdf]</ref> ''Gesellschaft'', on the other hand, is a group in which the individuals who make up that group are motivated to take part in the group purely by [[Selfishness|self-interest]]. He also proposed that in the real world, no group was either pure ''Gemeinschaft'' or pure ''Gesellschaft,'' but, rather, a mixture of the two.

====Social capital====
{{Main|Social capital}}

If community exists, both freedom and security may exist as well. The community then takes on a life of its own, as people become free enough to share and secure enough to get along. The sense of connectedness and formation of social networks comprise what has become known as [[social capital]].<ref>Putnam, D. 2000. ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of the American Community,'' p. 19.</ref>

Social capital is defined by [[Robert D. Putnam]] as "the collective value of all [[social networks]] and species (who people know) and the inclinations that arise from these works to do things for each other (norms of reciprocity)."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/saguaro/primer.htm |title=SAGUARO SEMINAR - Civic Engagement in America |publisher=Hks.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080502020439/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/saguaro/primer.htm |archivedate = May 2, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Social capital in action can be seen in all sorts of groups, including neighbors keeping an eye on each other's homes. However, as Putnam notes in ''[[Bowling Alone|Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community]]'' (2000), social capital has been falling in the United States. Putnam found that over the past 25 years, attendance at club meetings has fallen 58 percent, family dinners are down 33 percent, and having friends visit has fallen 45 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bowlingalone.com/ |title=''Bowling Alone'' web site |publisher=Bowlingalone.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>

The same patterns are also evident in many other western countries. [[Western world|Western]] [[cultures]] are thus said to be losing the spirit of community that once were found in [[institutions]] including [[church (building)|churches]] and [[Community centre|community centers]]. [[Sociologist]] [[Ray Oldenburg]] states in ''[[The Great Good Place (Oldenburg)|The Great Good Place]]'' that people need three places: 1) the [[home]], 2) the [[office]], and, 3) the community hangout or [[gathering place]].<ref>Project for Public Spaces. 2006. [http://www.pps.org/info/placemakingtools/placemakers/roldenburg Ray Oldenburg].</ref> With this philosophy in mind, many [[grassroots]] efforts such as The [[Project for Public Spaces]] are being started to create this "[[Third Place]]" in communities. They are taking form in independent bookstores, coffeehouses, local pubs, and through new and innovative means to create the social capital needed to foster the sense and spirit of community.<ref>University of Florida. 2006. [http://usfcollab.usf.edu/PDF/socialcapital.pdf Social Capital in Tampa Bay: An Update Report].</ref>

===As a Measure of Religiosity===
According to the sociologist [[Mervin F. Verbit|Mervin Verbit]], community may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity. And communal involvement itself may be broken down into four dimensions:
*content
*frequency
*intensity
*centrality
The content of one's communal involvement may vary from person to person (or from one religious organization to the next), as will the degree of the person's participation (frequency), and the intensity and centrality of that involvement (for that person).<ref>Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.</ref><ref>Küçükcan, T. (2010). Multidimensional Approach to Religion: a way of looking at religious phenomena. Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies, 4(10), 60-70.</ref><ref>http://www.eskieserler.com/dosyalar/mpdf%20(1135).pdf</ref>

===Psychology===
====Community====
{{Main|Sense of community}}

In a seminal 1986 study, McMillan and Chavis identify four elements of "sense of community":
#membership,
#influence,
#integration and fulfillment of needs,
#shared emotional connection.

They give the following example of the interplay between these factors:

<blockquote>Someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team. People attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of needs). The team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis). They play a game and win (successful shared valent event). While playing, members exert energy on behalf of the team (personal investment in the group). As the team continues to win, team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members), Influencing new members to join and continue to do the same. Someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and they do so (influence).<ref>McMillan, D.W., & Chavis, D.M. 1986. "Sense of community: A definition and theory," p. 16.</ref></blockquote>
[[File:Bigdayout crowd2.jpg|thumb|To what extent do participants in joint activities experience a [[sense of community]]?]]

A ''Sense of Community Index'' (SCI) has been developed by Chavis and colleagues and revised and adapted by others. Although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods, the index has been adapted for use in schools, the workplace, and a variety of types of communities.<ref>Perkins, D.D., Florin, P., Rich, R.C., Wandersman, A. & Chavis, D.M. (1990). Participation and the social and physical environment of residential blocks: Crime and community context. ''American Journal of Community Psychology, 18'', 83-115. Chipuer, H. M., & Pretty, G. M. H. (1999). A review of the Sense of Community Index: Current uses, factor structure, reliability, and further development. ''Journal of Community Psychology, 27''(6), 643-658. Long, D.A., & Perkins, D.D. (2003). Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the Sense of Community Index and Development of a Brief SCI. ''Journal of Community Psychology, 31'', 279-296.</ref>

Studies conducted by the APPA show substantial evidence that young adults who feel a sense of belonging in a community, particularly small communities, develop fewer psychiatric and depressive disorders than those who do not have the feeling of love and belonging.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Anthropology===
[[Cultural anthropology|Cultural]] (or [[social anthropology|social]]) anthropology has traditionally looked at community through the lens of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] fieldwork and ethnography continues to be an important methodology for study of modern communities. Other anthropological approaches that deal with various aspects of community include [[cross-cultural studies]] and the [[anthropology of religion]]. Cultures in modern society are also studied in the fields of [[urban anthropology]], [[ethnic studies]], [[ecological anthropology]], and [[psychological anthropology]]. Since the 1990s, internet communities have increasingly been the subject of research in the emerging field of [[cyber anthropology]].

====Archaeology====
[[Archaeology|Archaeological studies]] of social communities. The term "community" is used in two ways in archaeology, paralleling usage in other areas. The first is an informal definition of community as a place where people used to live. In this sense it is synonymous with the concept of an ancient [[Human settlement|settlement]], whether a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]], [[village]], [[town]], or [[city]]. The second meaning is similar to the usage of the term in other [[social sciences]]: a community is a group of people living near one another who interact socially. [[Social interaction]] on a small scale can be difficult to identify with archaeological data. Most reconstructions of social communities by archaeologists rely on the principle that social interaction is conditioned by physical distance. Therefore a small village settlement likely constituted a social community, and spatial subdivisions of cities and other large settlements may have formed communities. Archaeologists typically use similarities in [[material culture]]—from house types to styles of pottery—to reconstruct communities in the past. This is based on the assumption that people or households will share more similarities in the types and styles of their material goods with other members of a social community than they will with outsiders.<ref>Canuto, Marcello A. and Jason Yaeger (editors) (2000) ''The Archaeology of Communities''. Routledge, New York. Hegmon, Michelle (2002) Concepts of Community in Archaeological Research. In ''Seeking the Center: Archaeology and Ancient Communities in the Mesa Verde Region,'' edited by Mark D. Varien and Richard H. Wilshusen, pp. 263-279. University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City.</ref>

===Business and communications===
====Organizational communication====
{{Main|Organizational communication}}

Effective [[communication]] practices in group and organizational settings are very important to the formation and maintenance of communities. The ways that ideas and values are communicated within communities are important to the induction of new members, the formulation of agendas, the selection of leaders and many other aspects. Organizational communication is the study of how people communicate within an organizational context and the influences and interactions within [[organizational structure]]s. Group members depend on the flow of communication to establish their own identity within these structures and learn to function in the group setting. Although organizational communication, as a field of study, is usually geared toward companies and business groups, these may also be seen as communities. The principles of organizational communication can also be applied to other types of communities.

===Ecology===
{{Main|Community (ecology)}}

In ecology, a community is an assemblage of populations of different species, interacting with one another. Community ecology is the branch of [[ecology]] that studies interactions between and among species. It considers how such interactions, along with interactions between species and the [[abiotic]] environment, affect community structure and species richness, diversity and patterns of abundance. Species interact in three ways: [[competition]], [[predation]] and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]. Competition typically results in a double negative—that is both species lose in the interaction. Predation is a win/lose situation with one species winning. Mutualism, on the other hand, involves both species cooperating in some way, with both winning.

==Interdisciplinary perspectives==
===Socialization===
{{Main|Socialization}}
[[File:Lewes Bonfire, Martyrs Crosses.jpg|thumb|[[Lewes#Lewes Bonfire|Lewes Bonfire Night]] procession commemorating 17 Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake from 1555 to 1557]]

The process of learning to adopt the [[behavior]] patterns of the community is called [[socialization]]. The most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which [[individual]]s develop the skills and knowledge and learn the [[role]]s necessary to function within their [[culture]] and [[social environment]].<ref name=Socialization>Newman, D. 2005. [http://www.pineforge.com/upm-data/9006_Chapter_5.pdf Chapter 5. "Building Identity: Socialization"] pp. 134-140.</ref> For some psychologists, especially those in the [[psychodynamic]] tradition, the most important period of socialization is between the ages of one and ten. But socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment, where they must learn a new set of behaviors.<ref>Newman, D. 2005, p. 141.</ref>

Socialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. Other important influences include schools, [[Peer group|peer]] groups, people, mass media, the workplace, and government. The degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others. The norms of [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] are important "habits of the heart," as [[Alexis de Tocqueville|de Tocqueville]] put it, in an individual's involvement in community.<ref name = Community>Smith, M. 2001. [http://www.infed.org/community/community.htm Community].</ref>

==Community development==
{{Main|Community development}}

Community development, often linked with [[Community Work]] or Community Planning, is often formally conducted by [[non-government organisations]] (NGOs), universities or government agencies to progress the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities. Less formal efforts, called [[community building]] or [[community organizing]], seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities.<ref>Kelly, Anthony, "With Head, Heart and Hand: Dimensions of Community Building" (Boolarong Press)
ISBN 978-0-86439-076-9</ref> These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda. Community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger social institutions.

Formal programs conducted by universities are often used to build a knowledge base to drive curricula in sociology and [[community studies]]. The [[General Social Survey]] from the [[National Opinion Research Center]] at the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[Saguaro Seminar]] at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] are examples of national community development in the [[United States]]. In The [[United Kingdom]], [[Oxford University]] has led in providing extensive research in the field through its '' Community Development Journal,''<ref>[http://cdj.oxfordjournals.org/ Community Development Journal], Oxford University Press</ref> used worldwide by sociologists and community development practitioners.

At the intersection between community ''development'' and community ''building'' are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools. One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of [[Northwestern University]]. The institute makes available downloadable tools<ref>ABCD Institute, in cooperation with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. 2006. [http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/abcd/kelloggabcd.htmll ''Discovering Community Power: A Guide to Mobilizing Local Assets and Your Organization's Capacity''].</ref> to assess community assets and make connections between [[Non-profit organization|non-profit groups]] and other organizations that can help in community building. The Institute focuses on helping communities develop by "mobilizing neighborhood assets"&nbsp;— building from the inside out rather than the outside in.<ref>ABCD Institute. 2006. [http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/abcd.html Welcome to ABCD].</ref>

===Community building and organizing===
[[File:Affinity group collateral damage.jpg|thumb|upright|The anti-war [[affinity group]] "Collateral Damage" [[Activism|protesting]] the [[Iraq war]]]]

In ''The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace,'' [[M. Scott Peck|Scott Peck]] argues that the almost accidental sense of community that exists at times of crisis can be consciously built. Peck believes that conscious community building is a process of deliberate design based on the knowledge and application of certain rules.<ref>[[M. Scott Peck]], (1987). ''The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace,'' pp. 83-85.</ref> He states that this process goes through four stages:<ref>Peck (1987), pp. 86-106.</ref>

# '''Pseudocommunity''': The beginning stage when people first come together.  This is the stage where people try to be ''nice'', and present what they feel are their most personable and friendly characteristics.
# '''Chaos''': When people move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe enough to present their "shadow" selves. This stage places great demands upon the facilitator for greater leadership and organization, but Peck believes that "organizations are not communities", and this pressure should be resisted.
# '''Emptiness''': This stage moves beyond the attempts to fix, heal and convert of the chaos stage, when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness, common to us all as human beings. Out of this emptiness comes
# '''True community''': the process of deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community. This stage Peck believes can only be described as "glory" and reflects a deep yearning in every human soul for compassionate understanding from one's fellows.
More recently Peck remarked that building a sense of community is easy but maintaining this sense of community is difficult in the modern world.<ref>M. Scott Peck (1991). [http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC29/Peck.htm "The Joy of Community"]. An interview with M. Scott Peck by Alan Atkisson. ''In Context'' #29, p. 26.</ref> Community building can use a wide variety of practices, ranging from simple events such as [[potluck]]s and small [[Book discussion club|book clubs]] to larger–scale efforts such as mass [[festival]]s and [[construction]] projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors.

Community building that is geared toward citizen action is usually termed "community organizing."<ref name = organizing>Walls, David (1994) [http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/community-organizing.shtml "Power to the People: Thirty-five Years of Community Organizing"]. From ''The Workbook'', Summer 1994, pp. 52-55. Retrieved on: June 22, 2008.</ref> In these cases, organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies. Where good-faith negotiations fail, these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, [[boycott]]ing, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics. The [[ARISE Detroit!]] coalition and the [[Toronto Public Space Committee]] are examples of [[activism|activist networks]] committed to shielding local communities from government and corporate domination and inordinate influence.

Community organizing is sometimes focused on more than just resolving specific issues. Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance. Such groups facilitate and encourage [[consensus decision-making]] with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group. The three basic types of community organizing are [[grassroots]] organizing, [[coalition]] building, and "institution-based community organizing," (also called "broad-based community organizing," an example of which is [[faith-based community|faith-based community organizing]], or [[Congregation-based Community Organizing]]).<ref>Jacoby Brown, Michael, (2006), ''Building Powerful Community Organizations: A Personal Guide To Creating Groups That Can Solve Problems and Change the World'' (Long Haul Press)</ref>

If communities are developed based on something they share in common, whether that be location or values, then one challenge for developing communities is how to incorporate individuality and differences. Indeed, as Rebekah Nathan suggests in her book, My Freshman Year, we are actually drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness, despite stated commitments to diversity, such as those found on university websites. Nathan states that certain commonalities allow college students to cohere: "What holds students together, really, is age, pop culture, a handful of (recent) historical events, and getting a degree" (qtd. In Barrios 229). Universities may try to create community through all freshman reads, freshman seminars, and school pride; however, Nathan argues students will only form communities based on the attributes, such as age and pop culture, that they bring with them to college. Nathan's point, then, is that people come to college and don't expand their social horizons and cultural tolerance, which can prevent the development of your social community. (Barrios, Barclay. ''Emerging: Conetmporary Readings for Writers''. New York: Bedford St. Martins, 2010.)

====Community currencies====
Some communities have developed their own "[[Local Exchange Trading Systems]]" (LETS)<ref>Local Exchange Trading Systems were first developed by [[Michael Linton]], in [[Courtenay, British Columbia|Courtenay, BC]], ''see'' [http://www.gmlets.u-net.com/explore/home.html "LETSystems - new money"]. Retrieved: 2006-08-01.</ref> and [[local currencies]], such as the [[Ithaca Hours]] system,<ref>The Ithaca Hours system, developed by [[Paul Glover]] is outlined in [http://www.ithacahours.com/intro.html "Creating Community Economics with Local Currency"]. Retrieved: 2006-08-01.</ref> to encourage economic growth and an enhanced sense of community. Community Currencies have recently proven valuable in meeting the needs of people living in various South American nations, particularly Argentina, that recently suffered as a result of the collapse of the Argentinian national currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strohalm.net/en/site.php |title=Social Trade Organisation |publisher=Strohalm.net |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929083106/http://www.strohalm.net/en/site.php |archivedate = September 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

===Community service===
{{Main|Community service}}

[[Community service]] is usually performed in connection with a [[nonprofit organization]], but it may also be undertaken under the auspices of government, one or more businesses, or by individuals. It is typically unpaid and [[volunteering|voluntary]]. However, it can be part of alternative [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] approaches in a [[justice system]] and it can be required by educational institutions.

==Types of community==
[[File:Community Circle at OUR Ecovillage.jpg|thumb|upright|Participants in Diana Leafe Christian's "Heart of a Healthy Community" seminar circle during an afternoon session at O.U.R. [[Ecovillage]]]]

A number of ways to categorize types of community have been proposed; one such breakdown is:
# '''Geographic communities''': range from the local [[neighbourhood]], [[suburb]], [[village]], [[town]] or [[city]], region, nation or even the planet as a whole. These refer to communities of ''location''.
# '''Communities of culture''': range from the local clique, sub-culture, [[ethnic group]], [[religious]], [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] or [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] [[civilisation]], or the [[globalisation|global]] community cultures of today. They may be included as ''communities of need'' or ''identity'', such as [[disability|disabled persons]], or [[Senior Citizens|frail aged]] people.
# '''Community organizations''': range from informal [[family]] or [[kinship]] networks, to more formal [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated associations]], [[politics|political]] [[decision making]] structures, [[economics|economic]] enterprises, or professional associations at a small, national or international scale.

Communities are nested; one community can contain another—for example a geographic community may contain a number of ethnic communities.<ref>Tropman John E., Erlich, John L. and Rothman, Jack (2006), "Tactics and Techniques of Community Intervention" (Wadsworth Publishing)</ref>

===Location===
{{Details|Community of place}}

Possibly the most common usage of the word ''"community"'' indicates a large group living in close proximity. Examples of [[local community]] include:
* A [[municipality]] is an administrative local area generally composed of a clearly defined territory and commonly referring to a [[town]] or [[village]].
[[Image:Wakefield common.jpg|thumb|[[Wakefield, Massachusetts|Wakefield, Ma.]] is an example of a small town which constitutes a local community.]]
Although large [[cities]] are also municipalities, they are often thought of as a collection of communities, due to their diversity.
* A [[neighborhood]] is a geographically localized community, often within a larger [[city]] or [[suburb]].
* A [[new town|planned community]] is one that was [[urban planning|designed]] from scratch and grew up more or less following the plan. Several of the world's [[Capital (political)|capital cities]] are planned cities, notably [[Washington, D.C.]], in the [[United States]], [[Canberra]] in [[Australia]], and [[Brasília]] in [[Brazil]]. It was also common during the [[European colonization of the Americas]] to build according to a plan either on fresh ground or on the ruins of earlier [[Amerindian]] cities.

===Identity===
{{Details|Community of interest}}

In some contexts, ''"community"'' indicates a group of people with a common identity other than location. Members often interact regularly. Common examples in everyday usage include:
* A "professional community" is a group of people with the same or related occupations. Some of those members may join a [[professional society]], making a more defined and formalized group. These are also sometimes known as [[Community of practice|communities of practice]].
* A [[virtual community]] is a [[group (sociology)|group]] of people primarily or initially communicating or interacting with each other by means of information technologies, typically over the [[Internet]], rather than in person. These may be either communities of interest, [[Virtual Community of Practice|practice]] or communion. Research interest is evolving in the [[motivations for contributing to online communities]].

===Overlaps===
{{Details|Intentional community}}

Some communities share both location and other attributes. Members choose to live near each other because of one or more common interests.
* A [[retirement community]] is designated and at least usually designed for retirees and seniors—often restricted to those over a certain age, such as 56. It differs from a [[retirement home]], which is a single building or small complex, by having a number of autonomous households.
* An intentional community is a deliberate residential community with a much higher degree of social communication than other communities. The members of an intentional community typically hold a common social, political or spiritual vision and share responsibilities and resources. Intentional communities include [[Amish]] villages, [[ashrams]], [[cohousing]], [[commune (intentional community)|communes]], [[ecovillages]], [[housing cooperative]]s, [[kibbutzim]], and [[land trust]]s.

==Special nature of human community==
Definitions of community as "organisms inhabiting a common environment and interacting with one another,"<ref>Australian Academy of Science. [http://www.science.org.au/nova/010/010glo.htm Nova: Science in the News]. Retrieved: 2006-07-21.</ref> while scientifically accurate, do not convey the richness, diversity and complexity of human communities. Their classification, likewise is almost never precise. Untidy as it may be, community is vital for humans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[M. Scott Peck]] expresses this in the following way: "There can be no vulnerability without risk; there can be no community without vulnerability; there can be no peace, and ultimately no life, without community."<ref>Peck (1987), p. 233.</ref>
