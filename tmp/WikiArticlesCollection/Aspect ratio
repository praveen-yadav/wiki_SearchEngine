The '''aspect ratio''' is the ratio of the width of a [[shape]] to its height<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/aspect-ratio |title=What is aspect ratio? |first=Margaret |last=Rouse |date=September 2005 |accessdate=2013-02-03 |work=WhatIs? |publisher=TechTarget}}</ref> when the width is larger than the height, i.e. the shape is positioned as a "landscape" rather than "portrait".

The aspect ratio is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon (x:y). A common misunderstanding is that x and y represent actual length and height. This is false; they actually represent the relation between width and height. As an example, 8:5, 16:10 and 1.6:1 are the same aspect ratio.

It may be applied to two characteristic dimensions of a three-dimensional shape.

==Applications and uses==
The term is most commonly used with reference to:
* Graphic / image
** [[Aspect ratio (image)|Image aspect ratio]]
** [[Display aspect ratio]]: the aspect ratio for computer displays.
** [[Paper size]]
** [[Standard photographic print sizes]]
** [[List of film formats|Motion picture film formats]]
** [[Standard ad size]]
** [[Pixel aspect ratio]]
** [[Photolithography]]: the aspect ratio of an etched, or deposited structure is the ratio of the height of its vertical side wall to its width.
*** [[HARMST]] High Aspect Ratios allow the construction of tall structures without slant

* [[Tire sizing]]
* [[Aspect ratio (wing)|wing aspect ratio]] of an aircraft or bird
* [[Astigmatism]] of an [[optical lens]]
* Nanorod dimensions

==Examples==

===Rectangles===
{{Main|Aspect ratio (image)}}
For a rectangle, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of length to width of the rectangle. An aspect ratio of 1:1 is a square.

* 4:3 = 1.{{overline|3}}: Some (not all) 20th century computer monitors ([[VGA]], [[XGA]], etc.), [[standard-definition television]]
* √2:1 = 1.414…: International paper sizes ([[ISO 216]])
* 3:2 = 1.5: [[135 film|35mm still camera film]], [[iPhone#Model_comparison|iPhone]] displays
* [[16:10]] = 1.6 (not shown above): Commonly used [[widescreen]] [[computer display]]s ([[WXGA (graphics)|WXGA]])
* Φ:1 = 1.618…: [[Golden ratio]], close to 16:10
* 5:3 = 1.{{overline|6}}: [[Super 16 mm]],  a standard [[film gauge]] in many European countries
* 16:9 = 1.{{overline|7}}: [[Widescreen]] TV

===Ellipses===
For an ellipse, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the [[major axis]] to the [[minor axis]]. An aspect ratio of 1:1 is a circle.

==Math and aspect ratio==
Aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as ''x'':''y'' (pronounced "x-to-y") and ''x''×''y'' (pronounced "x-by-y"), with the latter particularly used for [[pixel dimensions]], such as 640×480. Cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a (rounded) decimal multiple of width vs unit height, while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height. In [[digital image]]s there is a subtle distinction between the [[Display Aspect Ratio|''Display'' Aspect Ratio]] (the image as displayed) and the [[Storage Aspect Ratio|''Storage'' Aspect Ratio]] (the ratio of pixel dimensions); see [[Aspect_ratio_(image)#Distinctions|Distinctions]].
