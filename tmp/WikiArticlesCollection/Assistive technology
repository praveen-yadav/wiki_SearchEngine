'''Assistive Technology''' is an [[umbrella term]] that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for [[disability|people with disabilities]] and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them. AT promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the [[technology]] needed to accomplish such tasks.

== Assistive Technology and Adaptive Technology ==

The term Adaptive Technology is often used as the [[synonym]] for Assistive Technology, however, they are different terms. Assistive Technology refers to "any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities," while Adaptive Technology covers items that are specifically designed for persons with disabilities and would seldom be used by non-disabled persons. In other words, "Assistive Technology is any object or system that increases or maintains the capabilities of people with disabilities," while Adaptive Technology is "any object or system that is specifically designed for the purpose of increasing or maintaining the capabilities of people with disabilities."<ref>{{cite web | title = Tennessee Science Standards | url = http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078901359/594902/AAT_v4.pdf | accessdate = 2012-10-05}}</ref> Consequently, Adaptive Technology is a subset of Assistive Technology. Adaptive Technology often refers specifically to electronic and Information Technology access.<ref>{{cite web | title = Assessing for Adaptive Technology Needs | url = http://dtn.tamu.edu/pdf/pp-assessingAT.ppt | accessdate = 2012-10-05}}</ref>

==Mobility impairment and wheelchairs==
{{Main|Wheelchair}}
[[File:Pride Jazzy Select power chair 001.JPG|thumb|A typical modern battery powered chair.]]
Wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and are designed to be a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility related [[Activities of Daily Living]] which include feeding, toileting, dressing grooming and bathing. The devices comes in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom [[walking]] is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.

==Mobility impairment and walkers==
{{Main|Walker (mobility)|l1=Walker}}

A [[walker (mobility)|walker]] or walking frame or Rollator is a tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking. It consists of a frame that is about waist high, approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes, such as for children, or for heavy people. Modern walkers are height-adjustable. The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front.<ref>C. Barrué. Personalization and Shared Autonomy in Assistive Technologies. Ph. Thesis.

==Personal Emergency Response Systems==
{{Main|Personal Emergency Response Systems|Telecare}}
[[File:Head-wand.jpg|thumb|This voter with a manual dexterity disability is making choices on a touchscreen with a head dauber.]]
[[Personal Emergency Response Systems]] (PERS), or [[Telecare]] (UK term), are a particular sort of Assistive Technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer. An example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for [[hypothermia]] risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild [[dementia]]). Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks. When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately.

==Accessibility software==
{{Main|Computer accessibility}}

In human–computer interaction, computer accessibility (also known as Accessible computing) refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include [[Web accessibility]] guidelines.<ref>[http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/page.cfm?pagecode=ISSIWD Web accessibility guidelines]</ref> Another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc. to their particular needs. This is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc. The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface.<ref>[http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/TCStruc.aspx?param=6205&title=Personal%20identification,%20electronic%20signature%20and%20cards%20and%20their%20related%20systems%20and%20operations CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface]</ref> This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by [[SNAPI]] and has been successfully incorporated into the [[Lasseo]] specifications, but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers.

==Assistive Technology for visual impairment==
{{Main|Blindness#Management}}
Many people with serious visual impairments live independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques.  Examples of Assistive Technology for visually impairment include the [[Canadian currency tactile feature]], which a system of raised dots in one corner, based on Braille cells but not standard [[Braille]].<ref>[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/accessibility.html Accessibility features - Bank Notes - Bank of Canada]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> For general computer use access technology such as [[screen reader]]s, [[screen magnifier]]s and [[refreshable Braille display]]s has been widely taken up along with  standalone reading aids that integrate a scanner, optical character recognition (OCR) software, and speech software in a single machine. These function together without a separate PC.<ref>{{cite web

==Augmentative and alternative communication==
{{Main|Augmentative and alternative communication}}
[[File:AAC user using eye gaze.JPG|right|thumb|An AAC user uses number coding on an eye gaze communication board]]

'''Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)''' is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language.<ref name=asha2005>[[#refASHA2005|ASHA (2005)]].</ref> AAC systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user. They may be as basic as pictures on a board that the are used to request food, drink, or other care; or they can be advanced [[speech generating device]]s, based on speech synthesis, that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words.<ref name="GillamMarquardt2000">[[#refGillamMarqardt2000|Gilliam & Marquardt]], pp. 356–359.</ref>

==Assistive Technology for Cognition==

Assistive Technology for Cognition (ATC)<ref>LoPresti, E.F., Mihailidis, A. & Kirsch, N. (2004). Assistive Technology for cognitive rehabilitation: State of the art. Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 14, 5-39.</ref> is the use of technology (usually high tech) to augment and assistive cognitive processes such as attention, memory, self-regulation, navigation, emotion recognition and management, planning, and sequencing activity. Systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of ATC are growing rapidly, but have focused on memory and planning, that there is emerging evidence for efficacy, that a lot of scope exists to develop new ATC.<ref>Gillespie, A., Best, C. & O'Neill, B.

==Prosthesis==
{{main|Prosthesis}}
A '''prosthesis''', '''prosthetic''', or '''prosthetic limb'''  is a device that replaces a missing [[Human body|body]] part. It is part of the field of [[biomechatronics]], the science of using [[Mechanical system|mechanical]] devices with human [[muscle]], [[skeleton]], and [[nervous systems]] to assist or enhance motor control lost by [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[disease]], or [[Congenital disorder|defect]]. Prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury (traumatic) or missing from birth ([[congenital]]) or to supplement defective body parts. Inside the body, [[artificial heart valve]]s are in common use with artificial [[artificial heart|heart]]s and [[artificial lung|lungs]] seeing less common use but under active technology development. Other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include [[hearing aids]], [[visual prosthesis|artificial eyes]], [[palatal obturator]], [[Adjustable gastric band|gastric bands]], and [[dentures]].

Prostheses are specifically ''not'' orthoses, although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis.  Prostheses are technically the complete finished item.  For instance, a C-Leg knee alone is ''not'' a prosthesis, but only a prosthetic ''component''. The complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system&nbsp; to the residual limb — usually a "socket", and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device. Keep this in mind as nomenclature is often interchanged.

It should be noted that the terms "prosthetic" and "orthotic" are adjectives used to describe devices such as a prosthetic knee.  The terms "prosthetics" and "orthotics" are used to describe the respective allied health fields.  The devices themselves are properly referred to as "prostheses" and "orthoses" in the plural and "prosthesis" and "orthosis" in the singular.

==Assistive Technology and sports==

[[File:NYC Marathon wheelchair.jpg|thumb|A [[New York City Marathon]] competitor uses a racing wheelchair.]]
Assistive Technology and sports is an area of technology design that is growing. Assistive Technology is the array of new devices created to  enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play. Assistive Technology may be used in [[adaptive sports]], where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, Assistive Technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.

An increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new Assistive Technology.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|page=425}}</ref> Assistive Technology devices can be simple, or "low-tech", or they may use highly advanced technology, with some even using computers. Assistive technology for sports may also be simple, or advanced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Assistive technologies|url=http://www.understandingdisability.org/AssistiveTechnologies|publisher=Spaulding Framingham|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}</ref> Accordingly, Assistive Technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to elite Paralympic games. More complex Assistive Technology devices have been developed over time, and as a result, sports for people with disabilities "have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity".<ref>{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|page=427}}</ref>

==Computer accessibility==
{{Main|Computer accessibility}}
[[File:Sip-and-puff device.jpg|thumb|This is a [[sip-and-puff]] device which allows a person with substantial disability to make selections and navigate computerized interfaces by controlling inhalations and exhalations.]]

One of the largest problems that affect patients with disabilities is discomfort with prosthesis.<ref name=hussein>{{cite journal|last=Abdullah|first=Hussein A.|coauthors=Tarry, Cole, , Datta, Rahul., Mittal, Gauri S., Abderrahim, Mohamed|title=Dynamic Biomechanical Model for Assessing and Monitoring Robot-Assisted Upper-Limb Therapy|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development|year=2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=43–62|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2006.03.0025|pmid=17551857}}</ref>  A new computer program is used to create the most comfortable and useful prosthetics.  An experiment performed in Massachusetts utilized 20 patients with various sensors attached to their arms.<ref name=hussein />  The patients tried different arm exercises, and the sensors recorded their movements. All of the data helped engineers develop new engineering concepts that for prosthetics.<ref name=hussein />

Alternatively, Assistive Technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves such as  [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] and other alternative layouts, which offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chubon, R.A., Hester, M.R. |title=An enhanced standard computer keyboard system for single-finger and typing-stick typing |journal=[[Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development]] |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=17–24 |year=1988 |pmid=2973523 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Anson, D., George, S., Galup, R., Shea, B., Vetter, R. |title=Efficiency of the Chubon versus the QWERTY keyboard |journal=Assistive-Technology |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=40–5 |year=2001 |pmid=12212435 |doi=10.1080/10400435.2001.10132032 }}</ref>

Assistive Technology devices have now been created to enable patients with disabilities to use modern touch screen mobile computers such as  the [[iPad]], [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]]. The Pererro is a plug and play adapter for [[iOS]] devices which uses the built in [[Apple VoiceOver]] feature in combination with a basic switch. This brings touch screen technology to those who were previously unable to use it.
