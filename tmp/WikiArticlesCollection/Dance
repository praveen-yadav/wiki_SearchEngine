'''Dance''' is a type of [[Art form|art]] that generally involves [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, often [[rhythm]]ic and to [[music]]. It is performed in many cultures as a form of [[emotional expression]], [[social interaction]], or [[exercise]], in a [[spiritual practice|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting, and is sometimes used to express ideas or tell a [[narrative|story]]. Dance may also be regarded as a form of [[nonverbal communication]] between humans or other [[animal]]s, as in [[bee dance]]s and [[Fixed action pattern|behaviour patterns]] such as a mating dances.

Definitions of what constitutes dance can depend on [[Society|social]] and [[Culture|cultural]] norms and [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] sensibilities. Definitions may range from functional movement (such as [[folk dance]]) to [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. Martial arts [[Kata (martial arts)|kata]] are often compared to dances, and sports such as [[gymnastics]], [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are generally thought to incorporate dance. 

There are many styles and genres of dance. [[African dance]] is interpretative. Ballet, [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[Tango (dance)|tango]] are classical dance styles. [[Square dance]] and [[Electric Slide|electric slide]] are forms of [[step dance]], and [[breakdancing]] is a type of [[street dance]]. Dance can be [[Participation dance|participatory]], [[social dance|social]], or [[Concert dance|performed]] for an [[audience]]. It can also be [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], [[:Category:Competitive dance|competitive]] or [[Erotic dance|erotic]]. Dance movements may be without significance in themselves, as in ballet or European folk dance, or have a [[gesture|gestural]] [[vocabulary]] or [[symbol]]ic meaning as in some Asian dances. 

[[Choreography (dance)|Choreography]] is the art of creating dances.  The person who creates (i.e., choreographs) a dance is known as the choreographer.

==Origins and history==
{{Main|History of dance}}

Dance does not leave behind clearly identifiable physical artifacts such as [[stone tool]]s, hunting implements or [[cave paintings]]. It is not possible to say when dance became part of human culture, but [[archeology|archeological]] evidence indicates dance has been an important part of [[ceremony]], [[ritual]]s, [[celebration (party)|celebration]]s and [[entertainment]] since the earliest human [[civilization]]s. Examples of such evidence include 9,000 year old paintings in [[India]] at the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC.

One of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been the telling of myths. Before the invention of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing stories down from generation to generation.<ref name="lecomte">Nathalie Comte. "Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World". Ed. Jonathan Dewald. Vol. 2. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. pp&nbsp;94–108.</ref> Dance was also used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of "love making." Another early use of dance may have been as a precursor to [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] [[altered state of consciousness|trance states]] in healing rituals. Dance is still used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian [[rainforest]] to the [[Kalahari Desert]].<ref name='guenther'>Guenther, Mathias Georg. 'The San Trance Dance: Ritual and Revitalization Among the Farm Bushmen of the Ghanzi District, Republic of Botswana.' Journal, South West Africa Scientific Society, v30, 1975–76.</ref>

Many contemporary dance forms can be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dance. For example, some [[Sri Lankan dances]] are related to aboriginal, mythical devils known as "[[yakkas]]", and according to local legend, [[Kandyan dance]] began as a ritual that broke the magic spell on a bewitched king.

====India====
{{Main|Dance in India}}

During the first millennium [[common era|BCE]] in India, many texts were composed which attempted to codify aspects of daily life. In the matter of dance, [[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyashastra]]'' (literally ''"the text of dramaturgy"'') is one of the earlier texts. Though the main theme of ''[[Natyashastra]]'' deals with drama, dance is also widely featured, and indeed the two concepts have ever since been linked in Indian culture. The text elaborates various hand-gestures or [[mudras]] and classifies movements of the various limbs of the body, gait, and so on.  The [[Natyashastra]] categorised dance into four groups and into four regional varieties, naming the groups: secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive. However, concepts of regional geography has altered and so have regional varieties of Indian dances. Dances like ''"Odra Magadhi"'', which after decades long debate, has been traced to present day Mithila, [[Odisha]] region's dance form of [[Odissi]] (Orissi), indicate influence of dances in cultural interactions between different regions.<ref>[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/article/dance Exoticindiaart.com], Dance: The Living Spirit of Indian Arts, by Prof. P. C. Jain and Dr. Daljeet.</ref>

From these beginnings rose the various classical styles which are recognised today. Therefore, all [[Classical Indian dance|Indian classical dances]] are to varying degrees rooted in the [[Natyashastra]] and therefore share common features: for example, the mudras, some body positions, and the inclusion of dramatic or expressive acting or [[abhinaya]].  The Indian classical music tradition provides the accompaniment for the dance, and as percussion is such an integral part of the tradition, the dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion.

=====Bhangra in the Punjab=====
{{Main|Bhangra (dance)}}
The [[Punjab region|Punjab]] area overlapping India and [[Pakistan]] is the place of origin of [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]]. It is widely known both as a style of music and a dance. It is mostly related to ancient harvest celebrations, love, patriotism or social issues. Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance.It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the [[Sikh]]s.

=====Sri Lanka=====
{{Main|Dances of Sri Lanka}}
The [[Dances of Sri Lanka#Devil Dances|devil dances of Sri Lanka]] or "yakun natima" are a carefully crafted ritual with a history reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past. It combines ancient "[[Ayurvedic]]" concepts of disease causation with psychological manipulation. The dance combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology, the dances also has an impact on the [[classical dances of Sri Lanka]].<ref>[http://www.lankalibrary.com/rit/yakun%20natuma.htm Lankalibrary.com], "The yakun natima&nbsp;— devil dance ritual of Sri Lanka"</ref>

====Europe and North America====

=====Concert (or performance) dance=====
{{Main|Concert dance}}

======Ballet======
{{Main|Ballet}}

[[Ballet]] developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined music, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Académie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.<ref name="lecomte"/>

======20th-century concert dance======
{{Main|20th century concert dance}}

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as [[modern dance]] include [[Loie Fuller]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Mary Wigman]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]], devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]], which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]]. [[Eurythmy]], developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see [[Modern dance]].

=====African American dance=====
{{Main|African American dance}}

[[African American dance]]s are those dances which have developed within African American communities in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies and its derivatives, [[tap dance]], [[disco]], [[jazz dance]], [[swing dance]], [[hip hop dance]] and [[breakdance]]. Other dances, such as the [[lindy hop]] with its relationship to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]] and [[rock and roll (dance)|rock and roll dance]] have also had a global influence.

==Dancing and music==

{{See also|Category:Music genres}}

Many early forms of music and dance were created and performed together. This paired development has continued through the ages with dance/music forms such as the [[jig]], [[waltz]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[disco]], [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], [[electronica]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]. Some [[musical genre]]s have a parallel dance form such as [[baroque music]] and [[baroque dance]]; others, such as [[Classical music era|classical music]] and [[classical ballet]], developed separately.

Although dance is often accompanied by [[music]], it can also be presented independently or provide its own accompaniment ([[tap dance]]). Dance presented with music may or may not be performed ''in time'' to the music depending on the style of dance. Dance performed without music is said to be ''danced to its own rhythm''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Dance studies==

{{See also|Dance theory|Choreography|Dance moves}}

In the early 1920s, dance studies (dance [[practice (learning method)|practice]], [[critical theory]], [[Musical analysis]] and [[history]]) began to be considered as an [[academic discipline]]. Today these studies are an integral part of many [[universities]]' [[The Arts|arts]] and [[humanities]] programs. By the late 20th century the recognition of practical [[knowledge]] as equal to academic knowledge led to the emergence of ''[[practice research]]'' and ''practice as research''. A large range of dance courses are available including:
* Professional practice: performance and technical skills
* Practice research: choreography and performance
* [[Ethnochoreology]], encompassing the dance-related aspects of: [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[gender studies]], [[area studies]], [[postcolonial theory]], [[ethnography]], etc.
* [[Dance therapy]], or dance-movement therapy
* Dance and technology: [[new media]] and performance [[technologies]]
* [[Laban Movement Analysis]] and somatic studies

[[Academic degree]]s are available from [[Bachelor of Arts|BA (Hons)]] to [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and other [[postdoctoral]] fellowships, with some dance [[scholar]]s taking up their studies as ''mature students'' after a [[professional]] dance career.

==Occupations==

{{Main|List of dance occupations}}

There are several careers connected with dancing: Dancer, dance teacher, dance sport coach, [[dance therapy|dance therapist]] and [[choreographer]].

;Dancer
[[File:HavanaDancers2.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Professional dancers at the [[Tropicana Club]], [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], in 2008]]

Professional dancers are usually employed on contract or for particular performances/productions. The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations, strong competition pressure and low pay. Professional dancers often need to supplement their income, either in dance related roles (e.g., dance teaching, dance sport coaches, yoga) or [[Pilates]] instruction to achieve financial stability.

In the U.S. many professional dancers are members of unions such as the [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Actors' Equity Association]]. The unions help determine working conditions and minimum salaries for their members.

;Dance teachers
Dance teacher and operators of [[dance school]]s rely on reputation and marketing. For dance forms without an association structure such as Salsa or Tango Argentino they may not have formal training. Most dance teachers are self-employed.

Dance training differs depending on the dance form. There are university programs and schools associated with professional dance companies for specialised training in classical dance (e.g. Ballet) and modern dance. There are also smaller, privately owned [[dance studio]]s where students may train in a variety of dance forms including competitive dance forms (e.g. Latin dance, ballroom dance, etc.) as well as ethnic/traditional dance forms.

;Dancesport coaches
Dancesport coaches are tournament dancers or former dancesports people, and may be recognised by a dance sport federation.

;Choreographer
Choreographers are generally university trained and are typically employed for particular projects or, more rarely may work on contract as the resident choreographer for a specific dance company. A choreographic work is protected intellectual property. Dancers may undertake their own choreography.

==Competitions==

[[File:MIT 2006 Standard Prechamp Final 2.jpg|thumb|right|267px|An amateur dancesport competition at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]]]

A '''dance competition''' is an organized event in which contestants perform dances before a judge or judges for awards, and in some cases, monetary prizes. There are several major types of dance competitions, distinguished primarily by the style or styles of dances performed. Major types of dance competitions include:
*'''[[Competitive dance]]''', in which a variety of theater dance styles such as: [[acro dance|acro]], [[ballet]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[hip-hop]], [[lyrical dance|lyrical]], and [[tap dance|tap]], are permitted.
*'''Open''' competitions, that permit a wide variety of dance styles. A popular example of this is the TV program ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]''.
*'''[[Dancesport]]''', which is focused exclusively on [[ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[latin dance]]. Popular examples of this are TV programs [[Dancing with the Stars]] and [[Strictly Come Dancing]].
*'''Single-style''' competitions, such as; [[Scottish highland dance|highland dance]], [[dance squad|dance team]], and [[Irish dance]], that only permit a single dance style.

Today, there are various dances and dance show competitions on television and the Internet.
