'''Transport in [[Angola]]''' comprises:

== Railways ==
{{main|Rail transport in Angola}}
There are three separate railway lines in Angola:
* [[Luanda Railway]] ([[Caminhos de Ferro de Luanda|CFL]]) (northern)
* [[Benguela Railway]] ([[Caminho de Ferro de Benguela|CFB]]) (central)
* [[Moçâmedes Railway]] ([[Moçâmedes Railway|CFM]]) (southern)

Reconstruction of these three lines began in 2005 and is expected to be completed by the end of the year 2012. The [[Benguela Railway]] already connects to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

== Highways ==

:''country comparison to the world:'' 79
* ''paved:'' 5,349&nbsp;km
* ''unpaved:'' 46,080&nbsp;km (2001)

Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles.  Whilst a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt.  In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road.

The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads, though.  Many companies are coming into the country from China and surrounding nations to help improve road surfaces.  The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes.  Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.

In April 2012, the Zambian Development Agency (ZDA) and an Angolan company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to build a multi-product pipeline from [[Lobito]] to [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]], to deliver various refined products to Zambia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.times.co.zm/?p=4888|title=Govt, Angola Ink U.S.$2.5 Billion Oil Deal |author=Chila Namaiko |publisher=Times of Zambia|location=Lusaka, Zambia|date=14 April 2012|accessdate=29 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.times.co.zm/?p=8706 |title=Angola ready to ‘oil’ Zambia|work=Times of Zambia|location=Lusaka, Zambia|date=9 May 2012|accessdate=29 May 2012}}</ref>
