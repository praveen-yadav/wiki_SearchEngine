'''''The Amazing Spider-Man''''' is an [[American comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]], featuring the adventures of the fictional [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. Being the [[Earth 616|mainstream continuity]] of the franchise, it began publication in 1963 as a monthly periodical and was published continuously, with a brief interruption in 1995, until its relaunch with a new numbering order in 1999. In 2003 the series reverted to the numbering order of the first volume. The title has occasionally been published biweekly, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010. [[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|A film named after the comic]] was released July 3, 2012.

After [[DC Comics]]' [[The New 52|relaunch]] of ''[[Action Comics]]'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]'' with new #1 issues in 2011, it had been the highest-numbered American comic still in circulation until it was cancelled. The title ended its 50-year run as a continuously published comic with [[Dying Wish|issue #700]] in December 2012. It was replaced by ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' as part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch of Marvel's comic lines.<ref name="SuperiorSM">{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/19523/marvel_now_qa_superior_spider-man#ixzz28x0lcuK0|title= Marvel NOW!

[[File:Amazing Fantasy 15.jpg|thumb|[[Amazing Fantasy]] vol. 1 #15 (August [[1962 in comics|1962]]), was Spider-Man's first appearance Art by [[Jack Kirby]]]]

Ditko left after the 38th issue, while Lee remained as writer until issue 100. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero.

''The Amazing Spider-Man'' has been the character's [[Canon (fiction)|flagship series]] for his first fifty years in publication, and was the only monthly series to star Spider-Man until ''[[Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' in 1976 (although 1972 saw the debut of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', with the vast majority of issues featuring Spider-Man along with a rotating cast of other Marvel characters). Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been introduced in ''Amazing'', and with few exceptions, it is where most key events in the character's history have occurred. The title was published continuously until #441 (Nov. 1998)<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1570/ ''The Amazing Spider-Man''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> when Marvel Comics relaunched it as vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/7794/ ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> but on Spider-Man's 40th anniversary, this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, beginning again with issue #500 (Dec. 2003) and lasting until the final issue, #700 (Dec. 2012).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/11288/ ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (continuation of volume 1)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

===The 1960s===
Due to strong sales on the character's first appearance in ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15, Spider-Man was given his own ongoing series in March 1963.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 91: "Thanks to a flood of fan mail, Spider-Man was awarded his own title six months after his first appearance.  ''Amazing Spider-Man'' began as a bimonthly title, but was quickly promoted to a monthly."</ref> The initial years of the series, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man's nascent career with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored teenager Peter Parker. Peter balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance [[photographer]] for ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'' under the bombastic editor-publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to support himself and his frail [[Aunt May]]. At the same time, Peter dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Liz Allan]] at Midtown High School, while embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson's secretary, [[Betty Brant]].

By focusing on Parker's everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a [[protagonist]] and not a [[sidekick]]. Ditko's quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel's most prominent artist, [[Jack Kirby]],<ref name="DeFalco87" /> and combined with the humor and pathos of Lee's writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.

Most of Spider-Man's key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time. Issue #1 (March 1963) featured the first appearances of J. Jonah Jameson<ref name="DeFalco91">DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 91</ref> and his [[astronaut]] son [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]]|inker= Ditko Steve|story= Spider-Man|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 1|date= March 1963}}</ref> and the supervillain the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]].<ref name="DeFalco91" /> It included the hero's first encounter with the superhero team [[The Fantastic Four]]. Issue #2 (May 1963) featured the first appearance of the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]]<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 92: "Introduced in the lead story of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2 and created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, the Vulture was the first in a long line of animal-inspired super-villains that were destined to battle everyone's favorite web-slinger."</ref> and the beginning of Parker's freelance [[photography]] career at the newspaper ''The Daily Bugle''.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= Duel to the Death with the Vulture!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 2|date= May 1963}}</ref>

The Lee-Ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters, including [[Doctor Octopus]] in #3 (July 1963);<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 93: "Dr. Octopus shared many traits with Peter Parker.

Comics historian [[Les Daniels]] noted that "Steve Ditko squeezes every ounce of anguish out of Spider-Man's predicament, complete with visions of the uncle he failed and the aunt he has sworn to save."<ref name=DanielsMarvel>{{Cite book|last=Daniels|first=Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title= Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics |publisher= [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

Although credited only as artist for most of his run, Ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them, leaving Lee to script the dialogue. A rift between Ditko and Lee developed, and the two men were not on speaking terms long before Ditko completed his last issue, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #38 (July 1966). The exact reasons for the Ditko-Lee split have never been fully explained.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 117: "To this day, no one really knows why Ditko quit. Bullpen sources reported he was unhappy with the way Lee scripted some of his plots, using a tongue-in-cheek approach to stories Ditko wanted handled seriously."</ref> Spider-Man successor artist [[John Romita, Sr.]], in a 2010 [[Deposition (law)|deposition]], recalled that Lee and Ditko "ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters..."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B_lZovnpi13JNWQ5MDJmOTgtZDMzYy00MzI3LTllYjctNmM0ZWE4NjgyOWEx&hl=en_US | title=Confidential Videotaped Deposition of John V.

Kirby, et al."| page= 45|location=[[Garden City, New York|Garden City]], [[New York]] | date=October 21, 2010}}</ref>

In successor penciler Romita Sr.'s first issue, #39 (Aug. 1966), archnemesis the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man's secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero. Romita's Spider-Man – more polished and heroic-looking than Ditko's – became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' [[managing editor]] [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] in #52 (Sept. 1967) and [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]], father of Parker's girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]], in #56 (Jan. 1968). The most important supporting character to be introduced during the Romita era was [[Mary Jane Watson]], who made her first full appearance in #42, (Nov. 1966),<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 119: "After teasing the readers for more than two years, Stan Lee finally allowed Peter Parker to meet Mary Jane Watson."</ref> although she first appeared in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since #15 (Aug. 1964). Peter David wrote in 2010 that Romita "made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling Mary Jane out from behind the oversized potted plant [that blocked the readers' view of her face in issue #25] and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment."<ref>David and Greenberger, p. 38</ref> Romita has stated that in designing Mary Jane, he "used [[Ann-Margret]] from the movie ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' as a guide, using her coloring, the shape of her face, her red hair and her form-fitting short skirts."<ref>Saffel "A Legend is Born", p. 27</ref>

Lee and Romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in Parker's world by improving Parker's relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures. The stories became more topical,<ref>Manning "1960s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 46: "Stan Lee tackled the issues of the day again when, with artists John Romita and Jim Mooney, he dealt with social unrest at Empire State University."</ref> addressing issues such as [[civil rights]], [[racism]], [[prisoners' rights]], the [[Vietnam War]], and political elections.

Issue #50 (June 1967) introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]],<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 122: "Stan Lee wanted to create a new kind of crime boss. Someone who treated crime as if it were a business...He pitched this idea to artist John Romita and it was Wilson Fisk who emerged in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50."</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= [[John Romita, Sr.|Romita, Sr., John]]|inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]]|story= Spider-Man No More!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 50|date= July 1967}}</ref> who would become a major force as well in the superhero series ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]''. Other notable first appearances in the Lee-Romita era include the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] in #41 (Oct. 1966),<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 119: "The first original super-villain produced by the new Spider-Man team of Stan Lee and John Romita was the Rhino."</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Romita, Sr., John|inker= Esposito, Mike|story= The Horns of the Rhino!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 41|date= October 1966}}</ref> the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] in #46 (March 1967),<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 121</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Romita, Sr., John|inker= Romita, Sr., John|story= The Sinister Shocker!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 46|date= March 1967}}</ref> the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] in #78 (Nov. 1969),<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= [[John Buscema|Buscema, John]]|inker= [[Jim Mooney|Mooney, Jim]]|story= The Night of the Prowler!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 78|date= November 1969}}</ref> and the Kingpin's son, [[Richard Fisk]], in #83 (April 1970).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Romita, Sr., John|inker= Esposito, Mike|story= The Schemer!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 83|date= April 1970}}</ref>

One such story took place in the controversial issues #96-98 (May–July 1971). Writer-editor Lee defied the [[Comics Code Authority]] with this story, in which Parker's friend Harry Osborn, was hospitalized after tripping on [[LSD]]. Lee wrote this story upon a request from the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] for a story about the dangers of drugs. Citing its dictum against depicting drug use, even in an anti-drug context, the CCA refused to put its seal on these issues. With the approval of Marvel publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], Lee had the comics published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.<ref>Saffel "Bucking the Establishment, Marvel Style", p. 60: "The stories received widespread mainstream publicity, and Marvel was hailed for sticking to its guns."</ref> The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.<ref>Daniels, pp. 152 and 154: "As a result of Marvel's successful stand, the Comics Code had begun to look just a little foolish. Some of its more ridiculous restrictions were abandoned because of Lee's decision."</ref>

The "[[The Six Arms Saga]]" of #100-102 (Sept.–Nov. 1971) introduced [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]]. The second installment was the first ''Amazing Spider-Man'' story not written by co-creator Lee,<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 59: "In the first issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' to be written by someone other than Stan Lee, Roy Thomas was faced with the mammoth task of not only filling the vaunted writer's shoes but also solving the bizarre cliffhanger from the last issue."</ref> with [[Roy Thomas]] taking over writing the book for several months before Lee returned to write #105-110 (Feb.-July 1972).<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 61: "Stan Lee had returned to ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' for a handful of issues after leaving following issue #100 (September 1971). With issue #110. Lee once again departed the title into which he had infused so much of his own personality over his near 10-year stint as regular writer."</ref> Lee, who was going on to become Marvel Comics' publisher, with Thomas becoming editor-in-chief, then turned writing duties over to 19-year-old [[wunderkind]] [[Gerry Conway]],<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 62: "[''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #111] marked the dawning of a new era: writer Gerry Conway came on board as Stan Lee's replacement. Alongside artist John Romita, Conway started his run by picking up where Lee left off."</ref> who scripted the series through 1975. Romita penciled Conway's first half-dozen issues, which introduced the gangster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] in #113 (Oct. 1972). Kane then succeeded Romita as penciler,<ref name="GCD-Kane" /> although Romita would continue inking Kane for a time.

The most memorable work of the Conway/Kane/Romita team was #121-122 (June–July 1973), which featured the death of Gwen Stacy at the hands of the Green Goblin in "[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]" in issue #121.<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 159: "In June [1973], Marvel embarked on a story that would have far-reaching effects. ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' artist John Romita, Sr. suggested killing off Spider-Man's beloved Gwen Stacy in order to shake up the book's status quo."</ref><ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 68: "This story by writer Gerry Conway and penciler Gil Kane would go down in history as one of the most memorable events of Spider-Man's life."</ref><ref>David and Greenberger p. 49: "The idea of beloved supporting characters meeting their deaths may be standard operating procedure now but in 1973 it was unprecedented...Gwen's death took villainy and victimhood to an entirely new level."</ref> Her demise and the Goblin's apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man.<ref>Saffel "Death and the Spider", p. 65: "Death struck again, with repercussions that would ripple through comics from that day forward."</ref> The aftermath of the story deepened both the characterization of [[Mary Jane Watson]] and her relationship with Parker.

In 1973, Gil Kane was succeeded by [[Ross Andru]], whose run lasted from issue #125 (October 1973) to #185 (October 1978).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/search/advanced/process/?target=sequence&method=icontains&logic=False&keywords=&order1=date&order2=&order3=&start_date=1972&end_date=1979&title=&feature=&job_number=&pages=&script=&pencils=Ross+Andru&inks=&colors=&letters=&story_editing=&genre=&characters=&synopsis=&reprint_notes=&story_reprinted=None&notes=&pub_name=&pub_notes=&brand=&brand_notes=&indicia_publisher=&is_surrogate=None&ind_pub_notes=&series=Amazing+Spider-Man&series_year_began=&series_notes=&tracking_notes=&issue_count=&is_comics=None&format=&color=&dimensions=&paper_stock=&binding=&publishing_format=&issues=&volume=&issue_title=&variant_name=&issue_date=&indicia_frequency=&price=&issue_pages=&issue_editing=&isbn=&barcode=&issue_notes=&issue_reprinted=None&is_indexed=None Ross Andru's run on ''The Amazing Spider-Man''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> Issue #129 (Feb. 1974) introduced the [[Punisher]],<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 72: "Writer Gerry Conway and artist Ross Andru introduced two major new characters to Spider-Man's world and the Marvel Universe in this self-contained issue.

The Conway-Andru era featured the first appearances of the [[John Jameson (comics)|Man-Wolf]] in #124-125 (Sept.-Oct. 1973); the near-marriage of Doctor Octopus and Aunt May in #131 (April 1974); Harry Osborn stepping into his father's role as the Green Goblin in #135-137 (Aug.-Oct.1974); and the original "[[Clone Saga]]", containing the introduction of [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man's clone]], in #147-149 (Aug.-Oct. 1975).
[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and Gil Kane produced the title's 150th issue (Nov. 1975) before [[Len Wein]] became writer with issue #151.<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 85: "To signify the start of this new era Spider-Man's new regular chronicler writer Len Wein would come onboard with this issue."</ref> During Wein's tenure, Harry Osborn and Liz Allen dated and became engaged, J.

[[Marv Wolfman]], Marvel's editor-in-chief from 1975 to 1976, succeeded Wein as writer, and in his first issue, #182 (July 1978), had Parker propose marriage to Watson who refused, in the following issue.<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 103: "As new regular writer Marv Wolfman took over the scripting duties from Len Wein and partnered with artist Ross Andru, Peter Parker decided to make a dramatic change in his personal life."</ref> [[Keith Pollard]] succeeded Ross Andru as artist shortly afterward, and with Wolfman introduced the likable rogue the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] (Felicia Hardy) in #194 (July 1979).<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 107: "Spider-Man wasn't exactly sure what to think about his luck when he met a beautiful new thief on the prowl named the Black Cat, courtesy of a story by writer Marv Wolfman and artist Keith Pollard."</ref> As a love interest for Spider-Man, the Black Cat would go on to be an important supporting character for the better part of the next decade, and remain a friend and occasional lover into the 2010s.

O'Neil wrote two issues of ''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' which were both drawn by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].

By mid-1984, [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]] took over scripting and penciling. DeFalco helped establish Parker and Watson's mature relationship, laying the foundation for the characters' wedding in 1987. Notably, in #257 (Oct. 1984), Watson tells Parker that she knows he is Spider-Man, and in #259 (Dec. 1984), she reveals to Parker the extent of her troubled childhood. Other notable issues of the DeFalco-Frenz era include #252 (May 1984), with the first appearance of Spider-Man's black costume, which the hero would wear almost exclusively for the next four years' worth of comics; the debut of criminal mastermind the [[Richard Fisk|Rose]], in #253 (June 1984); the revelation in #258 (Nov. 1984) that the black costume is a living being, a [[symbiote]]; and the introduction of the female mercenary [[Silver Sable]] in #265 (June 1985).

Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz were both removed from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' in 1986 by editor Owsley under acrimonious circumstances.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://lamerciepark.com/legacy/comics/spidey.html|title= Oswald: Why I Never Discuss Spider-Man|first= Christopher J.|last= Priest|date= May 2002|publisher= DigitalPriest.com|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6Frnzvbnu|archivedate= April 14, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= April 14, 2013|quote= The catalyst for my demise was my firing Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz off of ''Amazing Spider-Man''.}}</ref> A succession of artists including [[Alan Kupperberg]], [[John Romita, Jr.]], and [[Alex Saviuk]] penciled the book from 1987 to 1988; Owsley wrote the book for the first half of 1987, scripting the five-part "Gang War" story (#284-288) that DeFalco plotted. Former ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' writer [[Peter David]] scripted #289 (June 1987), which revealed Ned Leeds as being the Hobgoblin although this was [[retconned]] in 1996 by Roger Stern into Leeds not being the original Hobgoblin after all.

[[David Michelinie]] took over as writer in the next issue, for a story arc in #290-292 (July-Sept. 1987) that led to the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #21. The "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" storyline by writer [[J.M. DeMatteis]] and artists [[Mike Zeck]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]] crossed over into ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #293 and 294.<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 231: "The six-issue story arc...ran through all the Spider-Man titles for two months."</ref> Issue #298 (March 1988) was the first Spider-Man comic to be drawn by future industry star [[Todd McFarlane]], the first regular artist on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' since Frenz's departure. McFarlane revolutionized Spider-Man's look. His depiction – large-eyed, with wiry, contorted limbs, and messy, knotted, convoluted webbing – influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character. McFarlane's other significant contribution to the Spider-Man canon was the design for what would become one of Spider-Man's most wildly popular antagonists, the [[supervillain]] [[Venom (comics)|Venom]].<ref>Manning "1980s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 169: "In this landmark installment [issue #298], one of the most popular characters in the wall-crawler's history would begin to step into the spotlight courtesy of one of the most popular artists to ever draw the web-slinger."</ref> Issue #299 (April 1988) featured Venom's first appearance (a last-page cameo) before his first full appearance in #300 (May 1988). The latter issue featured Spider-Man reverting to his original red-and-blue costume.

Other notable issues of the Michelinie-McFarlane era include #312 (Feb. 1989), featuring the Green Goblin vs. the Hobgoblin; and #315-317 (May–July 1989), with the return of Venom.

===The 1990s===
With a civilian life as a married man, the Spider-Man of the 1990s was different from the superhero of the previous three decades. McFarlane left the title in 1990 to write and draw a new series titled simply ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]''. His successor, [[Erik Larsen]], penciled the book from early 1990 to mid-1991. After issue #350, Larsen was succeeded by [[Mark Bagley]], who had won the 1986 Marvel Tryout Contest<ref>Saffel "Taking Stock: The 1990s" pp. 185-186</ref> and was assigned a number of low-profile penciling jobs followed by a run on ''[[New Warriors]]'' in 1990. Bagley penciled the flagship Spider-Man title from 1991 to 1996.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/search/advanced/process/?target=sequence&method=icontains&logic=False&keywords=&order1=date&order2=&order3=&start_date=&end_date=&title=&feature=&job_number=&pages=&script=&pencils=Mark+Bagley&inks=&colors=&letters=&story_editing=&genre=&characters=&synopsis=&reprint_notes=&story_reprinted=None&notes=&pub_name=&pub_notes=&brand=&brand_notes=&indicia_publisher=&is_surrogate=None&ind_pub_notes=&series=Amazing+Spider-Man&series_year_began=&series_notes=&tracking_notes=&issue_count=&is_comics=None&format=&color=&dimensions=&paper_stock=&binding=&publishing_format=&issues=&volume=&issue_title=&variant_name=&issue_date=&indicia_frequency=&price=&issue_pages=&issue_editing=&isbn=&barcode=&issue_notes=&issue_reprinted=None&is_indexed=None Mark Bagley's run on ''The Amazing Spider-Man''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

The series' 30th-anniversary issue, #365 (Aug. 1992), was a double-sized, hologram-cover issue<ref>Cowsill "1990s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 199</ref> with the cliffhanger ending of Peter Parker's parents, long thought dead, reappearing alive. It would be close to two years before they were revealed to be impostors, who are killed in #388 (April 1994), scripter Michelinie's last issue. His 1987–1994 stint gave him the second-longest run as writer on the title, behind Stan Lee.

Issue #375 was released with a gold foil cover.<ref>Cowsill "1990s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 203</ref> There was an error affecting some issues and which are missing the majority of the foil.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/Home/4/1/73/1012?articleID=47490|title= Comic Printing Errors|publisher= [[Gemstone Publishing]]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6Fxc23Osz|archivedate= April 17, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= April 17, 2013}}</ref>

With #389, writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]], whose Spider-Man credits included the 1987 "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" story arc and a 1991–1993 run on ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', took over the title. From October 1994 to June 1996, ''Amazing'' stopped running stories exclusive to it, and ran installments of multi-part stories that crossed over into all the Spider-Man books. One of the few self-contained stories during this period was in #400 (April 1995), which featured the death of Aunt May &mdash; later revealed to have been faked (although the death still stands in the MC2 continuity). The "[[Clone Saga]]" culminated with the revelation that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man. This plot twist was massively unpopular with many readers,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.peterdavid.net/2012/12/24/the-illusion-of-change/|title= The Illusion of Change|first= Peter|last= David|date= July 3, 1998|publisher= [[Comics Buyer's Guide]]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6FxeLljND|archivedate= April 17, 2013|deadurl= no |accessdate= April 17, 2013|quote= [Marvel] came up with the Spider-Man clone.

And it didn’t. Because fans don’t like to be treated as if they’re stupid.}}</ref> and was later reversed in the "Revelations" story arc that crossed over the Spider-Man books in late 1996.

The Clone Saga tied into a publishing gap after #406 (Oct. 1995), when the title was temporarily replaced by ''The Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #1-2 (Nov.-Dec. 1995), featuring [[Ben Reilly]]. The series picked up again with #407 (Jan. 1996), with [[Tom DeFalco]] returning as writer. Bagley completed his 5½-year run by September 1996. A succession of artists, including [[Ron Garney]], [[Steve Skroce]], [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]], and [[Rafael Kayanan]], penciled the book until the final issue, #441 (Nov. 1998), after which Marvel rebooted the title with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).

===Relaunch and the 2000s===
Marvel began ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' anew with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).<ref name="Marvel 500s">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17588|publisher= Comic Book Resources|title= The Marvel 500s: How Many Are There?|first= James|last= Hunt|date= August 5, 2008|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6FrovtrC4|archivedate= April 14, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= April 14, 2013}}</ref><ref>Cowsill "1990s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 246: "This new series heralded a fresh start for the web-slinger's adventures."</ref> [[Howard Mackie]] wrote the first 29 issues. The relaunch included the Sandman being regressed to his criminal ways and the "death" of Mary Jane, which was ultimately reversed. Other elements included the introduction of a [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|new Spider-Woman]] (who was spun off into her own short-lived series) and references to [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne's]] ''[[Spider-Man: Chapter One]]'', which launched at the same time as the reboot. Mackie's run ended with ''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual 2001'', which saw the return of Mary Jane, who then left Parker upon reuniting with him.

With #30 (June 2001), [[J. Michael Straczynski]] took over as writer<ref>Cowsill "2000s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 262: "J. Michael Straczynski and artist John Romita, Jr. took the helm in this issue to create some of the best Spider-Man stories of the decade."</ref> and oversaw additional storylines &mdash; most notably his lengthy "Spider-Totem" arc, which raised the issue of whether Spider-Man's powers were magic-based, rather than as the result of a radioactive spider's bite. Additionally, Straczynski resurrected the plot point of Aunt May discovering her nephew was Spider-Man,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[J. Michael Straczynski|Straczynski, J. Michael]]|penciller= [[John Romita, Jr.|Romita, Jr., John]]|inker= [[Scott Hanna|Hanna, Scott]]|story= Interlude|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|volume= 2|issue= 37|date= January 2002}}</ref> and returned Mary Jane, with the couple reuniting in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50. Straczynski gave Spider-Man a new profession, having Parker teach at his former high school.

Issue #30 began a dual numbering system, with the original series numbering (#471) returned and placed alongside the volume-two number on the cover. Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', likewise were given the dual numbering around this time. In October 2000, [[John Romita, Jr.]] succeeded John Byrne as artist. After vol. 2, #58 (Nov. 2003), the title reverted completely to its original numbering for #500 (Dec. 2003).<ref name="Marvel 500s"/> [[Mike Deodato, Jr.]] penciled the series from mid-2004 until 2006.

That year Peter Parker revealed his Spider-Man identity on live television in the company-crossover storyline "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]",<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Straczynski, J.

This knowledge was erased from the world with the event of the four-part, crossover story arc, "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]", written partially by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and illustrated by [[Joe Quesada]], running through ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #544-545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24 (Nov. 2007) and ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. Here, the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] makes a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker's dying [[Aunt May]] if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski's tenure as writer. 

Following this, Marvel made ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' the company's sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of "back to basics" story arcs under the banner of "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]". Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with [[domino effect]] differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man's secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]). The alternating regular writers were initially [[Dan Slott]], [[Bob Gale]], [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Fred Van Lente]], and [[Zeb Wells]], joined by a rotation of artists that included [[Chris Bachalo]], [[Phil Jimenez]], [[Mike McKone]], [[John Romita, Jr.]] and [[Marcos Martín]]. [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], [[Mark Waid]] and [[Roger Stern]] later joined the writing team and [[Barry Kitson]] the artist roster. Waid's work on the series included a meeting between Spider-Man and [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #573 (Dec. 2008).<ref>Cowsill "2000s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 316: "The issue [#573] also saw TV star Stephen Colbert team up with Spider-Man in a back-up story written by Mark Waid and drawn by Patrick Olliffe."</ref>
Issue #583 (March 2009) included a back-up story in which Spider-Man meets President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>Cowsill "2000s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 319: "With President Obama about to be inaugurated, Marvel produced a special variant issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' complete with...a five-page back-up strip co-starring the President, written by Zeb Wells and drawn by Todd Nauck."</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2009-01-07-obama-spiderman-comic_N.htm|title= Obama, Spider-Man on the same comic-book page|first= David|last= Colton|date= January 7, 2009|publisher= ''[[USA Today]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121023171207/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2009-01-07-obama-spiderman-comic_N.htm|archivedate= October 23, 2012|deadurl= no}}</ref>

===2010s and temporary end of publication===
Mark Waid scripted the opening of the "[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]" storyline in issue #612 (Jan. 2010).<ref>Cowsill "2010s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 327: "Written by Mark Waid and drawn by Paul Azaceta, the two-part opening mixed the real-world drama of the economic meltdown with some Spidey action."</ref> With issue #648 (Jan. 2011), the series became a twice-monthly title with [[Dan Slott]] as sole writer.<ref>Cowsill "2010s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 334: "Spidey's adventures were about to take an exciting new direction as Dan Slott became the title's sole writer."</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27464|title= CCI: The Marvel: Spider-Man Panel|first= Josh|last= Wigler|date= July 25, 2010|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131020210035/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27464|archivedate= October 20, 2013|deadurl= no}} Archive requires scrolldown</ref> Eight additional pages were added per issue. This publishing format lasted until issue #700, which concluded the "[[Dying Wish]]" storyline, in which Parker and Doctor Octopus swapped bodies, and the latter taking on the mantle of Spider-Man when Parker apparently died in Doctor Octopus' body. ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' was to end with this issue, with the story continued in the new series ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title = Marvel's Peter Parker in Perilous Predicament|url= http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/marvels-peter-parker-perilous-predicament-18066448#.UN9OHonjmJK|first= Matt|last= Moore|publisher = [[Associated Press]] via [[ABC News]]|date= December 26, 2012|accessdate= December 29, 2012|archivedate= December 29, 2012|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6DHR3zFSK|deadurl = no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/26/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/spidey-700-controversy|title= Events in landmark ''Spider-Man'' issue have fans in a frenzy|first= Henry|last= Hanks|date= December 31, 2012|publisher= [[CNN]]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6KzOK3Y7a|archivedate= November 8, 2013|deadurl= no}}</ref> In December 2013, the series will return for five issues numbered 700.1 through 700.5 with the first two written by [[David Morrell]] and drawn by [[Klaus Janson]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comicsbeat.com/marvel-in-december-welcome-back-peter-parker-bye-kaine/|title= Marvel in December: Welcome Back, Peter Parker, Bye Kaine|first= Steve|last= Morris|date= September 12, 2013|publisher= The Beat|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131126035518/http://comicsbeat.com/marvel-in-december-welcome-back-peter-parker-bye-kaine/|archivedate= November 25, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= November 25, 2013}}</ref>
