There are a number of systems of '''transport in Burundi''', including road and water-based infrastructure, the latter of which makes use of [[Lake Tanganyika]].  Furthermore, there are also some airports in [[Burundi]].

A great hindrance to Burundi’s economic development is lack of adequate transportation. The country is [[landlock]]ed, and there are currently no railways in Burundi.

== Roads ==
Roads total {{convert|12322|km}} as of 2004, and only about 7 percent of them remain open in all weather; the rest are classed as local roads or tracks. In 2003, there were 24,000 passenger cars and 23,500 commercial vehicles.

===Roadways===
*total: 12,322&nbsp;km
*paved: 1,286&nbsp;km
*unpaved: 11,036 (2004)

== Waterways ==
[[Lake Tanganyika]] is used for transport, with the major [[port]] on the lake being [[Bujumbura]]. Most <!-- money --> freight is transported down waterways.

== Airports ==
Burundi possesses eight [[airport]]s, of which one has paved [[runway]]s, whose length exceeds 3,047m. The main airport in the country is [[Bujumbura International Airport]].

===Airports - with paved runways===
*total: 1
*over 3,047 m: 1 (2008)

===Airports - with unpaved runways===
*total: 7
**914 to 1,523 m: 4
**under 914 m: 3 (2008)

===Air Service===
The state-owned national airline, [[Air Burundi]], has not been operational since 2009. International services are provided by various airlines, including [[Kenya Airways]], [[Brussels Airlines]], [[Ethiopian Airlines]] and [[South African Airways]].

[[Bujumbura International Airport]] is the country’s primary and only paved airport. There are also a number of helicopter landing strips. In 1997, 11,000 passengers travelled on international and domestic flights.

===Heliports===
1 (2007)

== Railways ==
Burundi does not possess any [[railway]] infrastructure, although there are proposals to connect Burundi to its neighbours via railway.

At a meeting in August 2006 with members of the [[Rwanda Patriotic Front]], [[Wu Guanzheng]], of the [[Communist Party of China]], confirmed the intention of the [[People's Republic of China]] to fund a study into the feasibility of constructing a railway connecting at [[Isaka]] with the existing [[Tanzania]]n railway network, and running via [[Kigali]] in [[Rwanda]] through to Burundi.<ref>{{cite web|title=China to Assist Rwanda|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2006/09/china-to-assist-rwanda/|work=[http://www.railwaysafrica.com Railways Africa website]|publisher=Railways Africa|accessdate=21 September 2012}}</ref>  Tanzanian railways use {{RailGauge|m}} [[metre gauge]], although [[TAZARA]] and other neighbouring countries, including the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) use the {{RailGauge|1067}} [[Cape gauge]], leading to some potential difficulties.

Another project was launched in the same year, which aims to link Burundi and Rwanda (which also has no railways) to the DRC and [[Zambia]], and therefore to the rest of Southern Africa. At a meeting to inaugurate the [[Northern Corridor Transit Coordination Authority]] (NCTCA), the governments of Uganda and Burundi backed the proposed new railway from the Ugandan western [[railhead]] at [[Kasese]] into the DRC.

Additionally, Burundi has been added to a planned railway project to connect Tanzania and Rwanda.
