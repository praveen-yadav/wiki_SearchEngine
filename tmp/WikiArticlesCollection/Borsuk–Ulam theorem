In [[mathematics]], the '''Borsuk–Ulam theorem''', named after [[Stanislaw Ulam]] and [[Karol Borsuk]], states that every [[continuous function]] from an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] into [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]] maps some pair of [[antipodal point]]s to the same point.
Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center.

According to ({{Harvnb|Matoušek|2003|p=25}}), the first historical mention of the statement of this theorem appears in ({{Harvnb|Lyusternik|1930}}).  The first proof was given by ({{Harvnb|Borsuk|1933}}), where the formulation of the problem was attributed to Ulam.  Since then, many alternative proofs have been found by various authors, as collected in ({{Harvnb|Steinlein|1985}}).

==Theorem==
We use the stronger statement that every odd (antipodes-preserving) mapping ''h'' : '''S'''<sup>''n−1''</sup>&nbsp;→&nbsp;'''S'''<sup>''n−1''</sup> has odd [[degree of a mapping|degree]].

Using the above theorem it is easy to see that the original Borsuk Ulam statement is correct since if we take a map ''f'' : '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;→&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> that does not equalize on any antipodes then we can construct a map ''g'' : '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;→&nbsp;'''S'''<sup>''n−1''</sup> by the formula 

:<math>g(x)=\frac{f(x)-f(-x)}{|f(x)-f(-x)|}</math>

since ''f'' never equalizes antipodes the denominator never vanishes. Note that ''g'' is an antipode preserving map. Now let ''h'' : '''S'''<sup>''n−1''</sup>&nbsp;→&nbsp;'''S'''<sup>''n−1''</sup> be the restriction of ''g'' to the equator. By construction, ''h'' is antipode-preserving, and thus has non-zero degree. By construction, ''h'' extends to the whole upper hemisphere of '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup>, and as such is null-homotopic. A null-homotopic map has degree zero, contradicting our only assumption, namely that ''f'' exists.

== Corollaries==
* No subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is [[homeomorphic]] to '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup>.
* The [[Lusternik–Schnirelmann theorem]]: If the [[sphere]] '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup> is covered by ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 open sets, then one of these sets contains a pair (''x'',&nbsp;&minus;''x'') of antipodal points. (this is equivalent to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem)
* The [[Ham sandwich theorem]]: For any [[Compact space|compact]] sets ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A<sub>n</sub>'' in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> we can always find a hyperplane dividing each of them into two subsets of equal measure.
* The [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] ({{Harvnb|Matoušek|2003|p=25}}; {{Harvnb|Su|1997}}).
* The case ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 is often illustrated by saying that at any moment there is always a pair of antipodal points on the [[Earth]]'s surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures. This assumes that temperature and barometric pressure vary continuously.
* The case ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 can be illustrated by the claim that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the earth's equator with the same temperature, but this can be shown to be true much more easily using the [[intermediate value theorem]].
