'''Vipsania Agrippina''' or most commonly known as '''Agrippina Major''' or '''Agrippina the Elder''' (''Major'' Latin for ''the elder'', [[Classical Latin]]: <small>AGRIPPINA•GERMANICI</small>,<ref>{{Aut|E. Groag, A. Stein, L. Petersen - e.a.}} (edd.), ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani saeculi I, II et III'' ('''PIR'''), Berlin, 1933 - V 463</ref> 14 BC – 17 October 33) was a distinguished and prominent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] woman of the first century&nbsp;AD. Agrippina was the wife of the general and statesman [[Germanicus]] and a relative to the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|first]] [[Roman Emperors]].

She was the second granddaughter of the Emperor [[Augustus]],<ref name="Salisbury2001">{{cite book|author=Joyce E. Salisbury|title=Women in the ancient world|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HF0m3spOebcC&pg=PA3|accessdate=3 January 2012|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-092-5|page=3}}</ref> sister-in-law, stepdaughter and daughter-in-law of the Emperor [[Tiberius]], mother of the Emperor [[Caligula]], maternal second cousin and sister-in-law of the Emperor [[Claudius]] and the maternal grandmother of the Emperor [[Nero]].

==Family and early life==
Agrippina was born as the second daughter and fourth child to Roman statesman and Augustus’ ally [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] and [[Julia the Elder]]. Agrippina’s mother Julia was the only natural child born to Augustus from his second marriage to noblewoman [[Scribonia]].

Her father’s marriage to Julia was his third marriage. From Agrippa’s previous two marriages, Agrippina had two half-sisters: [[Vipsania Agrippina]] and [[Vipsania Marcella]] Agrippina. Vipsania Agrippina was Agrippa’s first daughter and first child from his first marriage to [[Pomponia Caecilia Attica]]. She became Tiberius's first wife and was the mother of his natural son [[Drusus Julius Caesar]].

Vipsania Agrippina later married senator and consul [[Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus]] after Tiberius was forced to divorce her and marry [[Julia the Elder]]. Vipsania Marcella was Agrippa’s second child from his second marriage to Augustus’ first niece and the paternal cousin of Julia the Elder, [[Claudia Marcella]] Major. Vipsania Marcella was the first wife of the general [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]].

Her mother’s marriage to Agrippa was her second marriage, as Julia the Elder was widowed from her first marriage, to her paternal cousin [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] and they had no children. From the marriage of Julia and Agrippa, Agrippina had four full-blood siblings: a sister [[Julia the Younger]] and three brothers: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]] and [[Agrippa Postumus]]. Agrippina was born in [[Athens]], as in the year of her birth Agrippa was in that city completing official duties on behalf of Augustus. Her mother and her siblings had travelled with Agrippa. Later Agrippina’s family returned to [[Rome]].

In 12 BC, Agrippina’s father died. Augustus had forced his first stepson Tiberius to end his happy first marriage to Vipsania Agrippina to marry Julia the Elder. The marriage of Julia and Tiberius was not a happy one. In 2 BC Augustus exiled Agrippina’s mother on the grounds that she had committed adultery, thereby causing a major scandal. Julia was banished for her remaining years and Agrippina never saw her again. Around this time, to avoid any scandals Tiberius divorced Julia and left Rome to live on the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Rhodes]].

With her siblings, Agrippina was raised in Rome by her maternal grandfather and maternal step-grandmother [[Livia]] Drusilla. Livia was the first Roman Empress and was Augustus’ third wife (from Livia’s first marriage to praetor [[Tiberius Nero]], she had two sons: the emperor Tiberius and the general [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]. Augustus was Livia's second husband).

According to [[Suetonius]], as a member of the imperial family, Agrippina was expected to display frugality, chastity and domesticity, all traditional virtues for a noble Roman woman. Agrippina and Augustus had a close relationship.

==Life with Germanicus==
Between 1 BC-5, Agrippina married her second maternal cousin [[Germanicus]].<ref name="Salisbury2001"/> Germanicus was the first son born to [[Antonia Minor]] and [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]. Antonia Minor was the second daughter born to [[Octavia Minor]] and triumvir [[Mark Antony]], hence Antonia’s maternal uncle was Augustus. Germanicus was a popular general and politician. Augustus ordered Tiberius to adopt Germanicus as his son and heir.<ref name="Salisbury2001"/> Germanicus was always favored by his great uncle and hoped that he would succeed Tiberius, who had been adopted by Augustus as his heir and successor. Agrippina and Germanicus were devoted to each other. She was a loyal, affectionate wife, who supported her husband. The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] states that Agrippina had an ‘impressive record as wife and mother’.

Agrippina and Germanicus in their union had nine children, of whom three died young. The six children who survived to adulthood were the sons: [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero Caesar]], [[Drusus Caesar]] and [[Caligula]] (Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus) and the daughters [[Agrippina the Younger]] (Julia Agrippina), [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] and [[Julia Livilla]]. Caligula would become future Roman Emperor. Agrippina the Younger would become a future Roman Empress and mother to the later Emperor Nero. Their children were born at various places throughout the Roman Empire and Agrippina acquired a well-deserved reputation for successful childbearing. Eventually Agrippina was proud of her large family and this was a part of the reason she was popular with Roman citizens.

According to Suetonius who had cited from [[Pliny the Elder]], Agrippina had borne to Germanicus, a son called Gaius Julius Caesar who had a lovable character. This son died young. The child was born at Treveri, near the village of Ambitarvium, just before the junction of the [[Moselle River]] and the [[Rhine]] River (modern [[Koblenz]], Germany). At this spot, there were local altars inscribed as a dedication to Agrippina: “IN HONOR OF AGRIPPINA’S [[puerperium|PUERPERIUM]]”.

Germanicus was a candidate for future succession and had won fame campaigning in [[Germania]] and [[Gaul]]. During the military campaigns, Agrippina accompanied Germanicus with their children. Agrippina’s actions were considered unusual as for a Roman wife, because a conventional Roman wife was required to stay home. Agrippina had earned herself a reputation as a heroic woman and wife. During her time in Germania, Agrippina had proved herself to be an efficient and effective diplomat. Agrippina had reminded Germanicus on occasion of his relation to Augustus.

A few months before Augustus’ death in 14, the emperor wrote and sent a letter to Agrippina mentioning a child who must be future emperor Caligula because at that time, no other child had this name.

The letter reads:
{{quote|Yesterday I made arrangements for Talarius and Asillius to bring your son Gaius to you on the eighteenth of May, if the gods will. I am also sending with him one of my slaves, a doctor who as I have told Germanicus in a letter, need not be returned to me if he proves of use of you. Goodbye my dear Agrippina! Keep well on the way to your Germanicus!}}

Agrippina and Germanicus travelled to the [[Middle East]] in 19, incurring the displeasure of [[Tiberius]]. Germanicus quarreled with [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], the governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and died in [[Antioch]] in mysterious circumstances. It was widely suspected that Germanicus had been poisoned or perhaps on the orders of Tiberius, with Agrippina believing he was assassinated.<ref name="Salisbury2001"/> Agrippina was in grief when Germanicus died. She returned with her children to [[Italy]] with Germanicus’ ashes. The Roman citizens had great sympathy for Agrippina and her family. She returned to Rome to avenge his death and boldly accused Piso of the murder of Germanicus. According to Tacitus (''Annals'' 3.14.1), the prosecution could not prove the poisoning charge, but other charges of treason seemed likely to stick and Piso committed suicide.

==Time in Rome, downfall and posthumous honors==
[[Image:Eustache Caligula.jpg|thumb|250px|''Caligula Depositing the Ashes of his Mother and Brother in the Tomb of his Ancestors'', by [[Eustache Le Sueur]], 1647]]
From 19 to 29, Agrippina lived on the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome. Her remaining children were raised between her, [[Livia]] Drusilla and Germanicus’ mother [[Antonia Minor]]. Agrippina had become lonely, distressed, physically ill and many of her relatives had died. Agrippina had a hasty, uncomfortable relationship with Tiberius and possibly with Tiberius’ mother Livia. She became involved in politics in Tiberius’ imperial court, became an advocate for her sons to succeed Tiberius, and opposed Tiberius’ natural son and natural grandson [[Tiberius Gemellus]] for succession.

She was unwise in her complaints about Germanicus’ death to Tiberius. Tiberius took Agrippina by her hand and quoted the Greek line: “And if you are not queen, my dear, have I then done you wrong?”

Agrippina became involved in a group of Roman Senators who opposed the growing power and influence of the notorious [[Praetorian Guard]] Lucius Aelius [[Sejanus]]. Tiberius began to distrust Agrippina. In 26, Agrippina requested Tiberius to allow her to marry her brother-in-law, Roman Senator Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus. However, Tiberius didn’t allow her to marry Saloninus, because of political implications the marriage could have.

Tiberius carefully staged to invite Agrippina to dinner at the imperial palace. At dinner, Tiberius offered Agrippina an apple<ref name="Salisbury2001"/> as a test of Agrippina’s feelings for the emperor. Agrippina had suspected that the apple could be poisoned and refused to taste the apple.<ref name="Salisbury2001"/> This was the last time that Tiberius invited Agrippina to his dinner table.<ref name="Salisbury2001"/> Agrippina later stated that Tiberius tried to poison her.

[[Image:Campitelli - Campidoglio, lapide di Agrippina al Tabularium 2285.JPG|thumb|250px|Cinerary urn of Agrippina, in the [[tabularium]]]]
In 29, Agrippina and her sons [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero]] and [[Drusus Caesar|Drusus]], were arrested on the orders of Tiberius. Tiberius falsely accused Agrippina of planning to take sanctuary besides the image of Augustus or with the Roman Army abroad. Agrippina and her sons were put on trial by the [[Roman Senate]]. She was banished on Tiberius’ orders to the island of Pandataria (now called [[Ventotene]]) in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] off the coast of [[Campania]]. This was the island where her mother was banished.

In prison at Pandataria, Agrippina protested violently. On one occasion, Tiberius ordered a guard to [[Flagellation|flog]] her. During the flogging Agrippina would lose an eye.<ref name="Salisbury2001"/> Refusing to eat, Agrippina was force-fed but later starved herself to death.<ref name="Salisbury2001"/> Tacitus however leaves open the possibility that she was deprived of nourishment while in prison and her death was not voluntary.<ref name="tac1">Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#25|6.25]]</ref> Be that as it may, she expired on 17 October 33.<ref name="tac1"/> Agrippina’s son Drusus died of starvation being imprisoned in Rome and Nero either committed suicide soon after the trial.<ref name="Salisbury2001"/> The notorious guard Sejanus was murdered in 31 on the orders of Tiberius. Tiberius suspected Sejanus of plotting to overthrow the emperor.

After her death, Tiberius slandered her name and had the senate declare that her birth date was a date of bad [[omen]].<ref name="Salisbury2001"/>

In March 37, Tiberius died and Agrippina’s remaining son Caligula succeeded as emperor. After Caligula delivered Tiberius’ eulogy, Caligula sailed to Pandataria and the [[Pontine Islands]] and returned with the ashes of his mother and brother Nero. Caligula returned with their ashes in urns in his own hands.

As proof of devotion to his family, Caligula arranged the most distinguished soldiers available to carry the urns of his mother and two brothers in two biers at noon in Rome, when the streets were at their busiest, to the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]. A bronze medal on display in the [[British Museum]] shows Agrippina’s ashes being brought back to [[Rome]] by Caligula.

Caligula appointed an annual day each year in Rome, for people to offer funeral sacrifices to honor their late relatives. As a dedication to Agrippina, Caligula set aside the Circus Games to honor the memory of his late mother. On the day that the Circus Games occurred, Caligula had a statue made of Agrippina’s image to be paraded in a covered carriage at the Games.

After the Circus Games, Caligula ordered written evidence of the court cases from Tiberius’ treason trials to be brought to the Forum to be burnt, first being the cases of Agrippina and her two sons.

===The historians===
According to Suetonius, Caligula nursed a rumor that Augustus and Julia the Elder had an incestuous union from which Agrippina the Elder had been born. According to Tacitus, Agrippina’s eldest daughter [[Agrippina the Younger]] had written memoirs for posterity. One memoir was an account of her mother’s life. A second memoir was about the fortunes of her mother’s family and the last memoir recorded the misfortunes (casus suorum) of the family of Agrippina and Germanicus. Unfortunately these memoirs are now lost.

==Personality==
Agrippina is regarded in ancient and modern historical sources as a Roman Matron with a reputation as a great woman, who had an excellent character and had outstanding Roman morals. She was a dedicated, supporting wife and mother who looked out for the interests of her children and the future of her family.

Her personality and conduct did however receive a certain amount of criticism. Her practice of accompanying Germanicus on campaigns was considered inappropriate, and her tendency to take command in these situations was viewed with suspicion as subversively masculine. Tacitus described her as “determined and rather excitable” - "Agrippina knew no feminine weaknesses. Intolerant of rivalry, thirsting for power, she had a man's preoccupations". Throughout her life, Agrippina always prized her descent from Augustus, upbraiding Tiberius for persecuting the blood of his predecessor; Tacitus, in writing of the occasion, believed this behaviour to be part of the beginning of "the chain of events leading to Agrippina's end."

==Legacy==
She was the first Roman woman of the Roman Empire to have traveled with her husband to Roman military campaigns; to support and live with the Roman Legions. Agrippina was the first Roman matron to have more than one child from her family to reign on the Roman throne. Apart from being the late maternal grandmother of Nero, she was the late paternal grandmother of Princess [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]], the child of Caligula. Through Nero, Agrippina was the paternal great-grandmother of [[Claudia Augusta]], (Nero's only child through his second marriage to [[Poppaea Sabina]]).

From the memoirs written by Agrippina the Younger, [[Tacitus]] used the memoirs to extract information regarding the family and fate of Agrippina the Elder, when Tacitus was writing The Annals. There is a surviving portrait of Agrippina the Elder in the [[Capitoline Museums]] in [[Rome]].

Agrippina is a featured figure on [[Judy Chicago]]'s installation piece ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', being represented as one of the 999 names on the ''[[List of women in the Heritage Floor|Heritage Floor]].''<ref name="AgrippinaBM">{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=Agrippina I | work=Elizabeth A.
