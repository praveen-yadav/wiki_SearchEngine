The aftermath of the plague created a series of religious, social, and economic upheavals, which had profound effects on the course of [[European history]]. It took {{val|150|u=years}} for Europe's population to recover. The plague reoccurred occasionally in Europe until the 19th&nbsp;century.

==Overview==
[[File:Holbein-death.png|thumb|Inspired by the Black Death, ''[[The Dance of Death]]'' or ''Danse Macabre'', an allegory on the universality of death, is a common painting motif in the late medieval period.]]

===Major outbreaks===
There have been three major outbreaks of plague. The [[Plague of Justinian]] in the 6th and 7th centuries is the first known attack on record, and marks the first firmly recorded pattern of [[bubonic plague]]. From historical descriptions, as much as 40% of the population of [[Constantinople]] died from the plague. Modern estimates suggest half of Europe's population died as a result of the plague before it disappeared in the 700s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-diseases/plague-article.html |title=Plague, Plague Information, Black Death Facts, News, Photos |work=National Geographic |accessdate=3 November 2008}}</ref> After 750 CE major epidemic diseases did not appear again in Europe until the Black Death of the 14th&nbsp;century.<ref>J.

The Black Death originated in or near China and spread by way of the [[Silk Road]] or by ship.<ref name=china/> It may have reduced [[world population]] from an estimated 450&nbsp;million down to 350–375&nbsp;million by the year 1400.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/worldpop/table_history.php |title=Historical Estimates of World Population |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>

The plague is thought to have returned at intervals with varying [[virulence]] and mortality until the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/cig/dangerous-diseases-epidemics/bubonic-plague.html |title=Epidemics of the Past: Bubonic Plague|publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=3 November 2008}}</ref> On its return in 1603, for example, the plague killed 38,000 Londoners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Plague |title=Plague – LoveToKnow 1911 |publisher=1911encyclopedia.org |accessdate=3 November 2008}}</ref> Other notable 17th-century outbreaks were the [[Italian Plague of 1629–1631|Italian Plague]] (1629–31); the [[Great Plague of Seville]] (1647–52); the [[Great Plague of London]] (1665–66);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://urbanrim.org.uk/plague%20list.htm |title=A list of National epidemics of plague in England 1348–1665 |publisher=Urbanrim.org.uk |accessdate=3 November 2008}}</ref> and the [[Great Plague of Vienna]] (1679). There is some controversy over the identity of the disease, but in its virulent form, after the [[Great Plague of Marseille]] in 1720–22,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beyond.fr/history/plague.html |title=Plague History Provence, – by Provence Beyond |publisher=Beyond.fr |accessdate=3 November 2008}}</ref> the [[Great Plague of 1738]] (which hit Eastern Europe), and the [[Russian plague of 1770-1772]], it seems to have gradually disappeared from Europe. By the early 19th&nbsp;century, the threat of plague had diminished, but it was quickly replaced by a new disease. The [[First cholera pandemic|Asiatic cholera]] was the first of several [[cholera]] pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>"[http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/05/09/f-cholera-outbreaks.html Cholera's seven pandemics]". CBC News. 2 December 2008.</ref>

The 14th-century eruption of the Black Death had a drastic effect on Europe's population, irrevocably changing the social structure, and resulted in widespread persecution of minorities such as [[Antisemitism|Jews]], foreigners, [[beggar]]s, and [[Leprosy|lepers]] (see [[#Persecutions|Persecutions]]). The uncertainty of daily survival has been seen as creating a general mood of morbidity, influencing people to "live for the moment," as illustrated by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in ''[[The Decameron]]'' (1353).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/decameronintro.html |title=Boccaccio: The Decameron, "Introduction" |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>

===Naming===
[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] people called the catastrophe of the 14th&nbsp;century either the "Great Pestilence"' or the "Great Plague".<ref name=Bennet&Hollister2006>J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 326.</ref> Writers contemporary to the plague referred to the event as the "Great Mortality". Swedish and Danish chronicles of the 16th&nbsp;century described the events as "black" for the first time, not to describe the late-stage sign of the disease, in which the sufferer's skin would blacken due to [[purpura|subepidermal hemorrhages]] and the extremities would darken with a form of [[gangrene]], [[acral necrosis]], but more likely to refer to black in the sense of glum or dreadful and to denote the terror and gloom of the events.<ref>S. Barry and N. Gualde, "The Biggest Epidemic of History" (La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire), ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°310, (2006), p. 38.</ref> The German physician and medical writer [[Justus Hecker]] suggested that a mistranslation of the Latin ''atra mors'' (terrible, or black, death) had occurred in Scandinavia when he described the catastrophe in 1832<ref name=Bennet&Hollister2006/> in his publication ''"Der schwarze Tod im vierzehnten Jahrhundert"''. The work was translated into English the following year, and with the [[cholera]] epidemic happening at that time, ''The Black Death in the 14th century'' gained widespread attention and the terms ''Schwarzer Tod'' and ''Black Death'' became more widely used in the German- and English-speaking worlds, respectively.

==Migration==
{{Main|Black Death migration}}

===Populations in crisis===
[[File:Blackdeath2.gif|thumb|Spread of the black death in Europe (1346–53)]]
In Europe, the [[Medieval Warm Period]] ended sometime towards the end of the 13th&nbsp;century, bringing the "[[Little Ice Age]]"<ref>World Regions in Global Context Third Edition</ref> and harsher winters with reduced harvests. In northern Europe, new technological innovations such as the heavy [[plough]] and the [[Crop rotation|three-field system]] were not as effective in clearing new fields for harvest as they had been in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] because the north had poor [[clay]] soil,<ref name=Bennet&Hollister2006/> and the potato, otherwise ideal for Northern Europe, was an American crop unknown in Europe at the time. Food shortages and rapidly inflating prices were a fact of life for as much as a century before the plague. Wheat, oats, hay and consequently livestock were all in short supply. Their scarcity resulted in [[malnutrition]], which increases susceptibility to infections due to weakened immunity. Consistently high [[fertility rate]]s, at five or more children per woman throughout Europe, resulted in high population growth rates and contributed to food shortages. In the autumn of 1314, heavy rains began to fall, followed by several years of cold and wet winters.<ref name=Bennet&Hollister2006/> The already weak harvests of the north suffered and the seven-year famine ensued. In the years 1315 to 1317, a catastrophic [[List of famines|famine]], known as the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]], struck much of northwest Europe. It was arguably the worst in European history, reducing the population by perhaps more than 10 percent.<ref name=Bennet&Hollister2006/>

===Infection and migration===
The plague disease, generally thought to be caused by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', is [[enzootic]] (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground [[rodent]]s, including [[marmot]]s, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|1998|p=25}}</ref> Nestorian graves dating to 1338–9 near [[Lake Issyk Kul]] in [[Kyrgizstan]] have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Paleomicrobiology: Past Human Infections |last1=Raoult |last2=Drancourt |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=152 |ref=harv}}</ref> In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China.<ref name=china/> In China, the 13th century [[Mongol invasion of China|Mongol conquest]] caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed in the beginning of the 14th&nbsp;century. In the 1330s a high frequency of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after.<ref>The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368, p.585</ref> The 14th-century plague killed an estimated 25&nbsp;million Chinese and other Asians during the 15&nbsp;years before it entered Constantinople in 1347.<ref>{{Cite book | first = George C. | last = Kohn | title = Encyclopedia of plague and pestilence: from ancient times to the present  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=tzRwRmb09rgC&pg=PA31&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false | publisher = Infobase Publishing | year = 2008 | page = 31 | isbn = 0-8160-6935-2}}</ref> However, according to George Sussman, the first obvious medical description of plague in China dates to 1644.<ref>Sussman GD (2011).

The disease may have travelled along the Silk Road with [[Mongols|Mongol]] armies and traders or it could have come via ship.<ref>
{{Cite journal |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8102278/Black-Death-may-have-originated-in-China.html |title=Black Death may have originated in China |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 November 2010 |ref=harv}}</ref> By the end of 1346, reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: "India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies".<ref>{{harvnb|Hecker|1859|p=21}} cited by Ziegler, p. 15.</ref>

Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe at the trading city of [[Feodosiya|Caffa]] in the [[Crimea]] in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the [[Defensive wall|city walls]] to infect the inhabitants. The [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] traders fled, taking the plague by ship into [[Sicily]] and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/blackdeath.html |title=Channel 4 – History – The Black Death |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=3 November 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625094232/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/blackdeath.html |archivedate=25 June 2008}}</ref> Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.

===European outbreak===

There appear to have been several introductions into Europe. It reached Sicily in October 1347 carried by twelve Genoese galleys,<ref>
Michael of Piazza (Platiensis) ''Bibliotheca scriptorum qui res in Sicilia gestas retulere'' Vol 1, p. 562, cited in Ziegler, 1998, p. 40.</ref> where it rapidly spread all over the island. Galleys from Caffa reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak in Pisa a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in [[Marseille]].<ref>De Smet, Vol II, ''Breve Chronicon'', p. 15.</ref>

From Italy,the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348–50. It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at [[Askøy]], then spread to Bjørgvin (modern [[Bergen]]) but never reached Iceland.<ref>

The plague spared some parts of Europe, including the [[Piast Poland#The Kingdom of Later Piasts (1295–1370)|Kingdom of Poland]] and isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Middle Eastern outbreak===
The plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the [[pandemic]], leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread to western Europe, the disease entered the region from southern Russia also. By autumn 1347, the plague reached [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, probably through the port's trade with [[Constantinople]], and ports on the [[Black Sea]]. During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to [[Gaza]], and north along the eastern coast to cities in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Palestine]], including [[Ashkelon]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Sidon]], [[Damascus]], [[Homs]], and [[Aleppo]]. In 1348–49, the disease reached [[Antioch]]. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Mecca]] became infected in 1349. During the same year, records show the city of [[Mawsil]] (Mosul) suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of Baghdad experienced a second round of the disease. In 1351 [[Yemen]] experienced an outbreak of the plague, coinciding with the return of [[King Mujahid]] of Yemen from imprisonment in [[Cairo]]. His party may have brought the disease with them from Egypt.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Contemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of [[bubo]]es (or gavocciolos) in the groin, the neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened.<ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/> [[Boccaccio]]'s description is graphic:

{{Cquote|In men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or armpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg...From the two said parts of the body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute and numerous. As the gavocciolo had been and still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were these spots on whomsoever they showed themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Giovanni Boccaccio|title=Decameron|year=1351/3|ref=harv}}</ref>}}

Ziegler comments that the only medical detail that is questionable is the infallibility of approaching death, as if the bubo discharges, recovery is possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|1998|p=18,19}}</ref>

This was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most victims died two to seven days after initial infection. David Herlihy identifies another potential sign of the plague: freckle-like spots and rashes<ref>D. Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1997), p. 29.</ref> which could be caused by flea-bites.

Some accounts, like that of Louis Heyligen, a musician in [[Avignon]] who died of the plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease which infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems<ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/> and which is identified with [[pneumonic plague]].

{{Cquote|It is said that the plague takes three forms. In the first people suffer an infection of the lungs, which leads to breathing difficulties.

Medical knowledge had stagnated during the Middle Ages. The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the king of France that blamed the heavens, in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a "great pestilence in the air".<ref>{{harvnb|Horrox|1994|p=159}}</ref> This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of "plague tracts" that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by ''bad air'' became the most widely accepted theory. The word ''plague'' had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.

The importance of hygiene was recognised only in the nineteenth century; until then it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding. A transmissible disease will spread easily in such conditions. One development as a result of the Black Death was the establishment of the idea of [[quarantine]] in [[Dubrovnik]] in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.<ref>
{{cite journal |author=Sehdev, Paul S. |year=2002 |title=The Origin of Quarantine |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=1071–1072 |doi=10.1086/344062 |pmid=12398064|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/9/1071.full}}

The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the [[plague (disease)|plague]] theory, which attributes the outbreak to ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist [[Alexandre Yersin]], after whom the pathogen was named ''Yersinia pestis''.<ref name=Chritakos2005>G. Christakos, ''Interdisciplinary Public Health Reasoning and Epidemic Modelling: the Case of Black Death'' (シュプリンガー・ジャパン株式会社, 2005), ISBN 3-540-25794-2, pp. 110–14.</ref> The mechanism by which ''Y. pestis'' was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by [[Paul-Louis Simond]] and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose [[midgut]]s had become obstructed by replicating ''Y. pestis'' several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by [[vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic; and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.<ref name=Chritakos2005/>

The historian [[Francis Aidan Gasquet]], who had written about the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893<ref>{{harvnb|Gasquet|1893}}</ref> and suggested that "it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague" was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the [[Justinian plague]] that was prevalent in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from 541 to 700 CE.<ref name=Chritakos2005/>

More recently other forms of plague have been implicated. The modern [[bubonic plague]] has a [[mortality rate]] of 30–75% and symptoms including fever of {{convert|38|–|41|°C|°F}}, headaches, painful, aching joints, [[nausea]] and vomiting, and a general feeling of [[malaise]]. If untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days.<ref>R. Totaro, ''Suffering in Paradise: The Bubonic Plague in English Literature from More to Milton'' (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 2005), p. 26.</ref> [[Pneumonic plague]] has mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged [[sputum]]. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red. [[Septicemic plague]] is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches ([[purpura]] due to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.<ref>{{harvnb|Byrne|2004|p=8}}</ref>

"Many modern scholars accept that the lethality of the Black Death stemmed from the combination of bubonic and pneumonic plague with other diseases and warn that every historical mention of 'pest' was not necessarily bubonic plague...In her study of 15th-century outbreaks, Ann Carmichael states that worms, the pox, fevers and dysentery clearly accompanied bubonic plague."<ref>{{harvnb|Byrne|2004|p=27}} quoting {{Cite journal|author=Ann Carmichael|title=Plague legislation|year=1986|pages=515–6|ref=harv}}</ref>

===Alternative explanations===
[[File:Plague victims blessed by priest.jpg|thumb|right|Plague victims being blessed, shown with symptoms from a late 14th-century manuscript ''[[Omne Bonum]]'' by James le Palmer]]
This interpretation was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002), [[David Herlihy]] (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).<ref name=Chritakos2005/>

It is recognised that an [[epidemiological]] account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the [[Domesday Book]] and the year 1377.<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|1998|p=233}}</ref> Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.

In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.<ref name=Chritakos2005/>

Walløe complains that all of these authors "take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat → rat flea → human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of ''Yersinia pestis'' infection could spread", whilst pointing to several other possibilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval and Modern Bubonic Plague: some clinical continuities|first =Lars|last=Walloe|page=69|series=Pestilential Complexities: Understanding Medieval Plague|editor=Vivian Nutton|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|year=2008|ref=harv}}

A variety of alternatives to the ''Y. pestis'' have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of [[anthrax]] and [[Norman Cantor|N. F. Cantor]] (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as ''hemorrhagic'' plague similar to [[Ebola]]. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the ''Y. pestis'' was spread from fleas on rats and argues that transmission must have been person to person.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=M.

In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of "blood poisoning") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.<ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9>{{harvnb|Byrne|2004|pp=21–9}}</ref>

===DNA evidence===

In October 2010, the open-access scientific journal ''[[PLoS Pathogens]]'' published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt & Raoult in 1998.<ref>

The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany

:"...ends the debate about the [[etiology]] of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that ''Y. pestis'' was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages."<ref name=Haensch2010/>

The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related [[clade]]s (genetic branches) of the ''Y. pestis'' [[genome]] associated with medieval mass graves. These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern ''Y. pestis'' strains ''Y. p. orientalis'' and ''Y. p. medievalis'', suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of [[plague pit]] remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of [[Marseille]] around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of [[Bergen op Zoom]] showed the ''Y. pestis'' genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities or another site.<ref name=Haensch2010>{{cite web|url=http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1001134 |title=Stephanie Haensch et al, "Distinct Clones of '&#39;Yersinia pestis'&#39; Caused the Black Death" |publisher=Plospathogens.org |date=7 October 2010  |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>

The results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended. Based on genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the [[East Smithfield]] burial site in England, Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 "that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of ''Y. pestis'' that may no longer exist."<ref>Schuenemann VJ, Bos K, DeWitte S, Schmedes S, Jamieson J, Mittnik A, Forrest S, Coombes BK, Wood JW, Earn DJD, White W, Krause J, Poinar H (2011): [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/08/24/1105107108.full.pdf+html Targeted enrichment of ancient pathogens yielding the pPCP1 plasmid of Yersinia pestis from victims of the Black Death.] PNAS 2011; published ahead of print 29 August 2011, {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1105107108}}</ref> A study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in October 2011 sequenced the genome of ''Y. pestis'' from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease.<ref name='nature_bos'/>

Renewed religious fervor and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black Death.

[[Leprosy|Lepers]], and other individuals with skin diseases such as [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or [[psoriasis]], were singled out and exterminated throughout Europe.

Because 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause, Europeans turned to astrological forces, earthquakes, and the poisoning of wells by Jews as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.<ref name=Bennet&Hollister2006/> The governments of Europe had no apparent response to the crisis because no one knew its cause or how it spread. The mechanism of infection and transmission of diseases was little understood in the 14th century; many people believed only God's anger could produce such horrific displays.

The Black Death had a profound impact on art and literature throughout the generation that experienced it. Many of the most useful manifestations of the Black Death in literature, to historians, comes from the accounts of its chroniclers. Some of these chroniclers were famous writers, philosophers and rulers such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]]. Their writings, however, did not reach the majority of the European population. Petrarch's work was read mainly by wealthy nobles and merchants of Italian [[city-state]]s. He wrote hundreds of letters and vernacular poetry, and passed on to later generations a revised interpretation of [[courtly love]].<ref>J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 372.</ref> There was one [[troubadour]], writing in the [[lyric poetry|lyric style]] long out of fashion, who was active in 1348. [[Peire Lunel de Montech]] composed the sorrowful ''[[sirventes]]'' "Meravilhar no·s devo pas las gens" during the height of the plague in [[Toulouse]].

===Third plague pandemic===
{{Main|Third plague pandemic}}
The Third plague pandemic (1855–1959) started in China in the middle of the 19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in India alone.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/321/5890/773 Infectious Diseases: Plague Through History], sciencemag.org</ref> Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia in 1900–25 resulted in well over {{val|1000|u=deaths}}, chiefly in Sydney. This led to the establishment of a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the bacillus ''Yersinia pestis''.<ref>[http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/museum/mwmuseum/index.php/Bubonic_Plague_comes_to_Sydney_in_1900 Bubonic Plague comes to Sydney in 1900], University of Sydney, Sydney Medical School</ref>
