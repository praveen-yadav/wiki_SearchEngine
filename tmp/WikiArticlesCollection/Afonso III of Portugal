'''Afonso III''' ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu}}; rare English alternatives: ''Alphonzo'' or ''Alphonse''), or ''Affonso'' (Archaic Portuguese), ''Alfonso'' or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin]]),  the ''Bolognian'' ([[Portuguese language|Port.]] ''o Bolonhês''), [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]] (5 May 1210 in [[Coimbra]] – 16 February 1279 in [[Alcobaça (Portugal)|Alcobaça]], [[Coimbra]] or [[Lisbon]]) was the first to use the title ''King of Portugal and the [[Kingdom of Algarve|Algarve]]'', from 1249. He was the second son of King [[Afonso II of Portugal]] and his wife, [[Urraca of Castile, Queen of Portugal|Urraca of Castile]]; he succeeded his brother, King [[Sancho II of Portugal]], who was removed from the throne on 4 January 1248.

==Early life==
As the second son of King [[Afonso II of Portugal]], Afonso was not expected to inherit the throne, which was destined to go to his elder brother Sancho.

He lived mostly in France, where he married Matilda, the heiress of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], in 1238, thereby becoming [[Count of Boulogne]].

==Reign==
[[File:EstatuaDAfonsoIIIFaro.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Afonso III in [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], a city which he reconquered from the Moors in 1249.]]
In 1246, conflicts between his brother, the king, and the church became unbearable. [[Pope Innocent IV]] then ordered Sancho II to be removed from the throne and be replaced by the Count of Boulogne. Afonso, of course, did not refuse the papal order and marched to Portugal. Since Sancho was not a popular king and the order was not hard to enforce; he was exiled to [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], where he lived in Toledo, where he died. Until his brother's death, and his eventual coronation, Afonso retained and used the title of ''Visitador, Curador e Defensor do Reino'' (''Overseer, Curator and Defender of the Kingdom'').

In order to ascend the throne he abdicated his rights to the county of Boulogne in 1248.

In 1253, he divorced Matilde, in order to marry [[Beatrice of Castile (1242–1303)|Beatrice of Castile]], illegitimate daughter of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X, King of Castile]], and Mayor Guillén de Guzmán (Maria de Guzman).

Determined not to commit the same mistakes as his brother, Afonso III paid special attention to what the middle class, composed of merchants and small land owners, had to say. In 1254, in the city of [[Leiria]], he held the first session of the ''[[Portuguese Cortes|Cortes]]'', a general assembly comprising the nobility, the middle class and representatives of all [[municipalities]]. He also made laws intended to restrain the upper classes from abusing the least favored part of the population. Remembered as a notable administrator, Afonso III founded several towns, granted the title of city to many others and reorganized public administration.

Afonso showed extraordinary vision for the time. Progressive measures taken during his kingship include: representatives of the commons, besides the nobility and clergy, were involved in governance; the end of preventive arrests such that henceforward all arrests had to be first presented to a judge to determine the detention measure; and fiscal innovation, such as negotiating extraordinary taxes with the mercantile classes and direct taxation of the Church, rather than debasement of the coinage. These may have led to his excommunication by the holy see and possibly precipitated his death, and his son [[Denis of Portugal|Denis]]'s premature rise to the throne at only 18 years old.

Secure on the throne, Afonso III then proceeded to make war with the Muslim communities that still thrived in the south. In his reign the [[Algarve]] became part of the kingdom, following the capture of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].

Following his success against the Moors, Afonso III had to deal with a political situation arising from the borders with Castile. The neighbouring kingdom considered that the newly acquired lands of the Algarve should be Castilian, not Portuguese, which led to a series of wars between the two kingdoms. Finally, in 1267, a treaty was signed in [[Badajoz]], determining that the southern border between Castile and Portugal should be the River [[Guadiana]], as it is today.

==Marriages and descendants==
Afonso's first wife was [[Matilda II, Countess of Boulogne]], daughter of [[Renaud, Count of Dammartin]], and [[Ida, Countess of Boulogne]]. She had two sons (Roberto and an unnamed one), but both died young.  He divorced Matilda in 1253 and, in the same year, married [[Beatrice of Castile (1242–1303)|Beatrice of Castile]], illegitimate daughter of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X, King of Castile]], and Mayor Guillén de Guzmán (Maria de Guzman).
