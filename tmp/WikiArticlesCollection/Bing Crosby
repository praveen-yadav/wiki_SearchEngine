'''Harry Lillis "Bing" Crosby, Jr.''' (May 3, 1903&nbsp;– October 14, 1977)<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', October 19, 1977.</ref> was an [[United States|American]] singer and actor.

''[[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank]]'' magazine recognized Crosby as the person who had done the most for American [[GI (military)|G.I.]] morale during [[World War II]] and, during his peak years, around 1948, polls declared him the "most admired man alive", ahead of [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Pope Pius XII]].<ref>Giddins, 2001, p. 6.</ref><ref name="crooner">{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Dr. Frank|title=Crooner|url=http://www.jeffosretromusic.com/bing.html|accessdate=December 29, 2006}}</ref> Also in 1948, the ''Music Digest'' estimated that Crosby recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music.<ref name="crooner"/>

Crosby exerted an important influence on the development of the postwar recording industry. He worked for [[NBC]] at the time and wanted to record his shows; however, most [[broadcast network]]s did not allow recording. This was primarily because the quality of recording at the time was not as good as live broadcast sound quality. While in Europe performing during the war, Crosby had witnessed tape recording, on which The Crosby Research Foundation would come to have many patents. The company also developed equipment and recording techniques such as the [[laugh track]] which are still in use today.<ref name="Sterling, C. H. 1990">Sterling, C. H., & Kittross, J. M. (1990). Stay tuned: A concise history of American broadcasting (2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</ref> In 1947, he invested $50,000 in the [[Ampex]] company, which built North America's first commercial [[reel-to-reel tape recorder]]. He left NBC to work for ABC because NBC was not interested in recording at the time. This proved beneficial because ABC accepted him and his new ideas.<ref name="Sterling, C. H. 1990"/> Crosby then became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto [[magnetic tape]]. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 200 recorders to his friend, musician [[Les Paul]], which led directly to Paul's invention of [[multitrack recording]]. Along with [[Frank Sinatra]], Crosby was one of the principal backers behind the famous [[United Western Recorders]] recording studio complex in Los Angeles.<ref>Cogan, Jim; Clark, William, [http://books.google.com/books?id=hO-KQ4o_B2MC&printsec=frontcover ''Temples of sound : inside the great recording studios''], San Francisco : Chronicle Books, 2003. ISBN 0-8118-3394-1</ref>

During the "Golden Age of Radio", performers often had to recreate their live shows a second time for the west coast time zone. Through the medium of recording, Crosby constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, [[time shifting]]) being used in motion picture production. This became the industry standard.

Crosby won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture ''[[Going My Way]]'', and was nominated for his reprise of the role in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' opposite [[Ingrid Bergman]] the next year, becoming the first of four actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first [[Grammy Award|Grammy Global Achievement Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Lifetime_Awards/ |title=Lifetime Achievement Award: Past Recipients|publisher=Grammy.com |date=February 8, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2010}}</ref> Crosby is one of the 22 people to have three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (a star for motion pictures, radio, and audio recording).

==Early life==
Crosby was born in [[Tacoma, Washington]], on May 3, 1903,<ref name=Grudens/> in a house his father built at 1112 North J Street.<ref>Crosby had no birth certificate and his birth date was unconfirmed until his childhood [[Roman Catholic]] church released his baptismal record.</ref> In 1906, Crosby's family moved to [[Spokane, Washington]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Blecha |first=Peter |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=7445} |title=the Free Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History |publisher=HistoryLink.org |date=August 29, 2005 |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}</ref> In 1913, Crosby's father built a house at 508 E. Sharp Ave.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gonzaga History 1980–1989 |url=http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Libraries/Foley-Library/Departments/Special-Collections/exhibitions/GonzagaHistory1980.asp |title=Gonzaga History 1980–1989&nbsp;– Gonzaga University |publisher=Gonzaga.edu |date=September 17, 1986 |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}</ref> The house now sits on the campus of Crosby's alma mater [[Gonzaga University]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Bing Crosby and Gonzaga University: 1903 - 1925 |url=http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/libraries/foley-library/departments/special-collections/Collections/Bing-Crosby-Collection/CrosbyandGonzaga.asp |title=Bing Crosby and Gonzaga University: 1903 - 1925 - Gonzaga University |publisher=Gonzaga.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-15}}</ref> and formerly housed the Alumni Association.

He was the fourth of seven children: brothers [[Larry Crosby|Larry]] (1895–1975), Everett (1896–1966), Ted (1900–1973), and [[Bob Crosby|Bob]] (1913–1993); and two sisters, Catherine (1904–1974) and Mary Rose (1906–1990). His parents were Harry Lillis Crosby, Sr. (1870–1950), a [[bookkeeper]], and Catherine Helen (known as Kate) (née Harrigan; 1873–1964). Crosby's mother was a second generation Irish-American.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gary|last=Giddins|title=Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams|year=2001}}</ref> His father was of English descent; some of his ancestors had emigrated to what would become the U.S. in the 17th century, and included ''[[Mayflower]]'' passenger [[William Brewster (pilgrim)|William Brewster]] (c. 1567&nbsp;– April 10, 1644).<ref>Giddins, 2001, p. 24.</ref>

In 1910, six-year-old Harry Crosby Jr. was forever renamed. The Sunday edition of the ''[[Spokesman-Review]]'' published a feature called "The Bingville Bugle".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Spokesman Review|title=The Bingville Bugle|first=Newton|last=Newkirk|date=March 14, 1909|accessdate =September 25, 2010|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/blogs/history/media/bingville.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Spokesman Review|title=The Bingville Bugle|first=Newton|last=Newkirk|date=July 19, 1914|accessdate=September 25, 2010|url=http://leonardodesa.interdinamica.net/comics/lds/bing/bingville.asp}}</ref> Written by humorist [[Newton Newkirk]], ''The Bingville Bugle'' was a [[parody]] of a [[hillbilly]] newsletter filled with gossipy tidbits, [[minstrel]] [[quips]], creative spelling, and mock ads. A neighbor, 15-year-old Valentine Hobart, shared Crosby's enthusiasm for "The Bugle" and noting Crosby's laugh, took a liking to him and called him "Bingo from Bingville". Eventually the last vowel was dropped and the nickname stuck.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Oa2_zcwucAgC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=bing+crosby+bingo+bingville+bugle&source=bl&ots=8DHK9U9Lfl&sig=BLFVQNnhQflUL769bVqYXepaWY8&hl=en&ei=JVqeTI-XM4H68Aa-2cAl&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCcQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=bing%20crosby%20bingo%20bingville%20bugle&f=false|author=Gary Giddins|title=Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams&nbsp;– The Early Years, 1903&nbsp;– 1940, Volume I|publisher=Back Bay Books|date=October 8, 2002}}</ref>

In 1917, Crosby took a summer job as property boy at [[Spokane]]'s "Auditorium", where he witnessed some of the finest acts of the day, including [[Al Jolson]], who held Crosby spellbound with his [[ad lib]]bing and [[Parody|spoofs]] of [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian songs]]. Crosby later described Jolson's delivery as "electric".<ref name=pop40t3B>{{cite book

==Popular success==

===Music===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
In 1923, Crosby was invited to join a new band composed of high school students much younger than himself.  Al Rinker, Miles Rinker, James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers, who performed at dances both for high school students and club-goers. The group disbanded after two years.<ref>Giddins, 2001, p. 92-97</ref>

By 1925, Crosby had formed a vocal duo with partner [[Al Rinker]], brother of singer [[Mildred Bailey]]. Bailey introduced Rinker and Crosby to [[Paul Whiteman]], who was at that time America's most famous bandleader. Hired for $150 a week, they made their debut on December 6, 1926 at the [[Tivoli Theatre (Chicago)|Tivoli Theatre]] in Chicago. Their first recording was "I've Got The Girl", with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record did them no vocal favors, as it was inadvertently recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78 rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Mildred Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.

Even as the Crosby and Rinker duo was increasing in popularity, Whiteman added a third member to the group. The threesome, now including pianist and aspiring songwriter [[Harry Barris]], were dubbed "[[The Rhythm Boys]]". They joined the Whiteman touring act, performing and recording with musicians [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Eddie Lang]] and [[Hoagy Carmichael]], also appearing together in a Whiteman movie.

Crosby soon became the star attraction of [[the Rhythm Boys]], and in 1928 he had his first number one hit with the Whiteman orchestra, a jazz-influenced rendition of "[[Ol' Man River]]". However, Crosby's reported taste for alcohol and his growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to his quitting [[the Rhythm Boys]] to join the [[Gus Arnheim]] Orchestra. During his time with Arnheim, the other two Rhythm Boys were increasingly pushed to the background as the emphasis was on Crosby. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby's subsequent hits including "At Your Command", "[[I Surrender Dear]]", and "[[Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams (song)|Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams]]". But the members of the band had a falling out and split, setting the stage for Crosby's solo career.<ref name=kl.>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3094/biography}}</ref>

On September 2, 1931, Crosby made his solo radio debut.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html| title=Bing Crosby, Singer| publisher=Radio Hall of Fame| accessdate=September 2, 2010}}</ref> Before the end of the year, he signed with both [[Brunswick Records]] and [[CBS Radio]]. Doing a weekly 15-minute radio broadcast, Crosby quickly became a huge hit.<ref name=kl. /> His songs "[[Out of Nowhere (Johnny Green song)|Out of Nowhere]]", "[[Just One More Chance]]", "[[At Your Command]]" and "[[I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)]]" were all among the best selling songs of 1931.<ref name=kl. />

As the 1930s unfolded, Crosby became the leading singer in America. Ten of the top 50 songs for 1931 featured Crosby, either solo or with others. A so-called "Battle of the Baritones" with singing star [[Russ Columbo]] proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan "Bing Was King". Crosby played the lead in a series of sound-era musical comedy short films for [[Mack Sennett]], signed with Paramount and starred in his first full-length feature, 1932's ''[[The Big Broadcast]]'', the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. He would appear in 79 pictures, and signed a long-term deal with [[Jack Kapp]]'s new record company [[Decca Records|Decca]] in late 1934,

Around this time, Crosby co-starred on radio with [[Carl Fenton|The Carl Fenton Orchestra]] on a popular [[CBS]] radio show. By 1936, he'd replaced his former boss, [[Paul Whiteman]], as the host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', the weekly radio program where he remained for the next ten years. "[[Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)]]", which showcased one of his then-trademark [[whistling]] interludes, became his theme song and signature tune.

Crosby's much-imitated style helped take popular singing beyond the kind of "[[belt (music)|belting]]" associated with boisterous performers like [[Al Jolson]] and [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], who had been obliged to reach the back seats in New York theaters without the aid of the microphone. As [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] noted in ''The Great American Popular Singers'', something new had entered American music, a style that might be called "singing in American" with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet "[[crooner]]".

Crosby made numerous live appearances before American troops fighting in the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]]. He also learned how to pronounce German from written scripts and would read propaganda broadcasts intended for the German forces. The nickname "Der Bingle" was common among Crosby's German listeners and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and [[Bob Hope]].

=="White Christmas"==
[[File:Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye in White Christmas trailer.jpg|right|thumb|From ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' trailer (1954)]]
The biggest hit song of Crosby's career was his recording of [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]", which he first introduced on a Christmas Day radio broadcast in 1941 (of which no extant copy is known), and soon thereafter in his 1942 movie ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]''. Crosby's recording hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to No.&nbsp;1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks. A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by Decca, charting another 16 times. It topped the charts again in 1945, and for a third time in January 1947. The song remains the best-selling single of all time.<ref name=kl. /> According to [[Guinness World Records]], Crosby's recording of "White Christmas" has "sold over 100 million copies around the world, with at least 50&nbsp;million sales as singles".<ref>{{cite book| title=[[Guinness Book of Records]] 2007| publisher=Guinness| date=August 1, 2006| isbn=978-1-904994-12-1}}</ref> Crosby's recording was so popular that he was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles. Though the two versions are very similar, it is the 1947 recording which is most familiar today. Crosby was dismissive of his role in the song's success, saying later that "a jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully."

He received critical acclaim for his performance as an alcoholic entertainer in ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'', and received his third [[Academy Award]] nomination.

Crosby starred with [[Bob Hope]] and actress [[Dorothy Lamour]] in seven ''[[Road to]]'' musical comedies between 1940 and 1962, cementing the two entertainers as an on-and-off duo, despite never officially declaring themselves a "team" in the sense that [[Laurel and Hardy]] or [[Martin and Lewis|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis]] were teams. The series consists of ''[[Road to Singapore]]'' (1940), ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' (1941), ''[[Road to Morocco]]'' (1942), ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' (1946), ''[[Road to Rio]]'' (1947), ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952), and ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' (1962). Appearing solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other during their various appearances, typically in a comically insulting fashion, and they appeared together countless times on stage, radio, and television over the decades as well as cameos in several additional films. In the 1949 [[Disney]] animated film ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'', Crosby provided the narration and song vocals for ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' segment.

[[File:Bing Crosby in Road to Singapore trailer.jpg|thumb|left|Crosby in ''Road to Singapore'']]
By the late 1950s, Crosby had become seen as an avuncular elder statesman of music, and his albums ''[[Bing Sings Whilst Bregman Swings]]'' and ''[[Bing With A Beat]]'' sold reasonably well,<ref name=kl. /> even in the rock-and-roll era. In 1960, Crosby starred in ''[[High Time (film)|High Time]]'', a collegiate comedy with [[Fabian Forte]] and [[Tuesday Weld]] that predicted the emerging gap between him and the new young generation of musicians and actors who had begun their careers after WWII. The following year, Crosby and Hope reunited for one more ''Road'' movie, ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'', which teamed them up with the much younger [[Joan Collins]] and [[Peter Sellers]]. Collins was used in place of their longtime partner Dorothy Lamour, whom Crosby felt was getting too old for the role, although Hope refused to do the movie without her so she instead made a lengthy cameo appearance.<ref name=kl. /> Not long before his death in 1977, Crosby had plans for yet another ''Road'' film in which the aging trio of himself, Hope, and Lamour search for the legendary Fountain of Youth. Ever media-savvy, he was alleged to have asked the scriptwriters to model ''The Road To The Fountain Of Youth'' on the ''[[Monty Python]]'' series so as to keep the humor fresh and contemporary for 1970s audiences.

[[Warner Bros.]] [[cartoons]] occasionally [[caricature]]d Crosby, alternately as an animal and as himself.  His recognizable appearance popped up in ''[[I've Got to Sing a Torch Song]]'', ''[[Hollywood Steps Out]]'' and ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'', while bird versions appeared in ''[[The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos]]'', ''[[Swooner Crooner]]'' and ''[[Curtain Razor]]''.  ''[[Bingo Crosbyana]]'' had an insect version of him.

==Television==
[[File:Bing Crosby and family 1974 Christmas special.JPG|thumb|Crosby and his family in a Christmas special, 1974]]
''The Fireside Theater'' (1950) was Crosby's first television production. The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at [[Hal Roach#Hal Roach Studios|Hal Roach Studios]] rather than performed live on the air. The "telefilms" were syndicated to individual television stations.

Crosby was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s. He was especially closely associated with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s variety show ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]''. He was the show's first and most frequent guest host, and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children. In the early 1970s he made two famous late appearances on the ''[[Flip Wilson Show]]'', singing duets with the comedian. Crosby's last TV appearance was a Christmas special filmed in London in September 1977 and aired just weeks after his death. It was on this special that Crosby recorded a duet of "[[The Little Drummer Boy]]" and "Peace on Earth" with the flamboyant rock star [[David Bowie]]. It was rush-released as a single 45-rpm record, and has since become a staple of holiday radio, and the final popular hit of Crosby's career. At the end of the century, ''TV Guide'' listed the Crosby-Bowie duet as one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th-century television.

Bing Crosby Productions, affiliated with [[Desilu Studios]] and later [[CBS Television Studios]], produced a number of television series, including Crosby's own unsuccessful [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Bing Crosby Show]]'' in the 1964–1965 season (with co-stars [[Beverly Garland]] and [[Frank McHugh]]). The company produced two ABC medical dramas, ''[[Ben Casey]]'' (1961–1966) and ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]]'' (1963–1964), the popular ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' (1965–1971) military comedy on CBS, as well as the lesser-known show ''[[Slattery's People]]'' (1964–1965). Another show that Crosby Productions produced was the game show ''[[Beat the Odds]]''.

===Singing style and vocal characteristics===
[[File:Bing Crosby Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|Crosby's last portrait taken backstage at the Palladium theater, 1977]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Crosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone, rather than using the deep, loud "vaudeville style" associated with [[Al Jolson]] and others. Crosby's love and appreciation of jazz music helped bring the genre to a wider mainstream audience. Within the framework of the novelty-singing style of [[The Rhythm Boys]], Crosby bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was firmly rooted in jazz. He had already been introduced to [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Bessie Smith]] prior to his first appearance on record. Crosby and Armstrong would remain professionally friendly for decades, notably in the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', where they sang the duet "Now You Has Jazz".

During the early portion of his solo career (about 1931–1934), Crosby's emotional, often pleading style of [[crooning]] was popular. But Jack Kapp (manager of [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] and later [[Decca Records|Decca]]) talked Crosby into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms, in favor of a straight-ahead clear vocal style.

Crosby also elaborated on a further idea of [[Al Jolson]]'s: phrasing, or the art of making a song's [[lyrics|lyric]] ring true. His success in doing so was influential. "I used to tell [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]] over and over," said [[Tommy Dorsey]], "there's only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby. All that matters to him is the words, and that's the only thing that ought to for you, too."

Vocal critic Henry Pleasants wrote:
<blockquote>[While] the octave B flat to B flat in Bing's voice at that time [1930s] is, to my ears, one of the loveliest I have heard in forty-five years of listening to baritones, both classical and popular, it dropped conspicuously in later years. From the mid-1950s, Bing was more comfortable in a bass range while maintaining a baritone quality, with the best octave being G to G, or even F to F. In a recording he made of '[[Dardanella]]' with [[Louis Armstrong]] in 1960, he attacks lightly and easily on a low E flat. This is lower than most opera basses care to venture, and they tend to sound as if they were in the cellar when they get there.<ref>Pleasants, H. (1985). The Great American Popular Singers. Simon and Schuster.</ref></blockquote>

===Career statistics===
Crosby's was among the most popular and successful musical acts of the 20th century. Although ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine operated under different methodologies for the bulk of Crosby's career, his chart numbers remain astonishing: 383 chart singles, including 41 No.&nbsp;1 hits. Crosby had separate charting singles in every calendar year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of "White Christmas" extended that streak to 1957. He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone. ''Billboard'''s statistician [[Joel Whitburn]] determined Crosby to be America's most successful recording act of the 1930s, and again in the 1940s.

[[File:Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye in White Christmas trailer 3.jpg|thumb|left|Crosby with [[Danny Kaye]] in ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' (1954)]]For 15 years (1934, 1937, 1940, 1943–1954), Crosby was among the top 10 in box-office drawing power, and for five of those years (1944–1948) he topped the world.<ref name=kl. /> He sang four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning songs&nbsp;– "Sweet Leilani" (1937), "White Christmas" (1942), "[[Swinging on a Star]]" (1944), "In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening" (1951)&nbsp;– and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in ''[[Going My Way]]'' (1944).

He collected 23 gold and platinum records, according to the book ''Million Selling Records''. The Recording Industry Association of America did not institute its gold record certification program until 1958, by which point Crosby's record sales were barely a blip; prior to that point, gold records were awarded by an artist's own record company. Universal Music, current owner of Crosby's Decca catalog, has never requested RIAA certification for any of his hit singles.

Although often overlooked in many biographies, Crosby charted 23 ''Billboard'' hits from 47 recorded songs with the [[Andrews Sisters]], whose Decca record sales were second only to Crosby's throughout the 1940s. Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne were his most frequent collaborators on disc from 1939 to 1952, a partnership which produced four million-selling singles: "[[Pistol Packin' Mama]]", "[[Jingle Bells]]", "[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]", and "[[South America, Take it Away]]". They made one film appearance together in "[[Road to Rio]]" singing "[[You Don't Have to Know the Language]]", and they sang together countless times on radio shows throughout the 1940s and 1950s (appearing as guests on each other's shows quite often, as well as on many shows for the [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] during and after World War II). The quartet's Top-10 ''Billboard'' hits from 1943–1945 (including "[[The Vict'ry Polka]]", "[[There'll Be a Hot Time in the Town of Berlin (When the Yanks Go Marching In)]]", and "[[Is You Is or Is You Ain't (Ma' Baby?)]]") were major morale-boosters for the American public during the war years.<ref>Sforza, John: "Swing It!

In 1962, Crosby was given the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He has been inducted into the halls of fame for both radio and popular music. In 2007 Crosby was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame, and in 2008 into the Western Music Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westernmusic.com/performers/hof-crosby.html |title=Johnny Bond&nbsp;– WMA Hall of Fame |publisher=Westernmusic.com |accessdate=February 10, 2010}}</ref>

==Entrepreneurship==

===Mass media===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2007}}
Crosby's radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows. (The live production of radio shows was also reinforced by the musicians' union and [[ASCAP]], which wanted to ensure continued work for their members.) In ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', historian John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional [[broadcast quality]] standard:
<blockquote>[Crosby saw] an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows. The scheduling could now be done at the star's convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. [[Fred Allen]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Phil Harris]], and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily.</blockquote>

Crosby's insistence eventually factored into the further development of [[magnetic tape sound recording]] and the radio industry's widespread adoption of it.<ref>Hammar, Peter. Jack Mullin: The man and his machines. Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 37 (6): 490–496, 498, 500, 502, 504, 506, 508, 510, 512; June 1989.</ref><ref>An afternoon with Jack Mullin. NTSC VHS tape, 1989 AES.</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040603153341/www.tvhandbook.com/History/History_tape.htm ''History of Magnetic tape'', section: "Enter Bing Crosby"] (WayBack Machine)</ref> He used his clout, both professional and financial, to innovate new methods of reproducing audio of his performances. But NBC (and competitor CBS) were also insistent, refusing to air prerecorded radio programs. Crosby walked away from the network and stayed off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], his sponsor, that was settled out of court. Crosby returned to the air for the last 13 weeks of the 1945–1946 season.

The [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] network, on the other hand, had pre-recorded some of its programs as early as the 1938 run of ''[[The Shadow]]'' with [[Orson Welles]]. And the new [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network, which had been formed out of the sale of the old [[NBC Blue Network]] in 1943 following a federal [[anti-trust]] action, was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by [[Philco]]. He would also get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch lacquer/[[aluminum disc]]s that played ten minutes per side at 33⅓ rpm.

Crosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons. The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for his golf game. And he did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the [[Jasper National Park]] Invitational Golf Tournament in September, just when the new radio season was to start. But golf was not the most important reason.
[[File:Bing Crosby Perry Como Arthur Godfrey 1950.JPG|left|thumb|With [[Perry Como]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]] in 1950]]
Though Crosby did want more time to tend his other business and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances. Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the [[microphones]] his way; the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio since the beginning of the electrical era. No longer would he have to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat). He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name [[Minute Maid]]. This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.<ref name="Time">{{cite news| title=CORPORATIONS: Minute Maid's Man| date=October 18, 1948| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799353,00.html| work=Time|work=Time | accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>

The transcription method posed problems, however. The acetate surface coating of the aluminum discs was little better than the wax that Edison had used at the turn of the 20th century, with the same limited dynamic range and frequency response.

However, Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German [[Magnetophon]] in June 1947—the same device that [[Jack Mullin]] had brought back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. [[Alexander M. Poniatoff]] ordered his [[Ampex|Ampex company]], which he'd founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.

Crosby hired Mullin to start recording his ''Philco Radio Time'' show on his German-made machine in August 1947, using the same 50 reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at [[Bad Nauheim]] near [[Frankfurt]] while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The crucial advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:
<blockquote>By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.</blockquote>

Mullin's 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby's account:
<blockquote>In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it&nbsp;– thought it was very funny&nbsp;– but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This [[Ad libitum|ad lib]] way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.</blockquote>

Crosby invested US$50,000 in [[Ampex]] with an eye towards producing more machines. In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was taped with the new Ampex Model 200 tape recorder using the new Scotch 111 tape from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing ([[3M]]) company. Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:
<blockquote>One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.</blockquote>
Crosby had launched the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film ''[[Mr. Music]]'', Crosby is seen singing into one of the new Ampex tape recorders that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend [[Bob Hope]].

Mullin continued to work for Crosby to develop a [[videotape recorder]] (VTR). Television production was mostly [[live television]] in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. 1950's ''The Fireside Theater'', sponsored by [[Procter & Gamble]], was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with [[video tape]], so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the "telefilms" were [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to individual television stations.

Crosby continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE), gave the world's first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by [[Jack Mullin|John T. Mullin]] and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device aired what were described as "blurred and indistinct" images, using a modified [[Ampex]] 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (6.3&nbsp;mm) audio tape moving at 360&nbsp;inches (9.1 m) per second.<ref>"Tape Recording Used by Filmless 'Camera{{'"}}, ''New York Times'', November 12, 1951, p. 21.

===Thoroughbred horse racing===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
Crosby was a fan of [[Thoroughbred horse race|thoroughbred horse racing]] and bought his first racehorse in 1935. In 1937, he became a founding partner of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and a member of its Board of Directors. Operating from the [[Del Mar Racetrack]] at [[Del Mar, California]], the group included millionaire businessman [[Charles S. Howard]], who owned a successful racing stable that included [[Seabiscuit]]. His son, [[Lindsay C. Howard|Lindsay Howard]], became one of Crosby's closest friends; Crosby named his son [[Lindsay Crosby|Lindsay]] after him, and would purchase his 40-room [[Hillsborough, California|Hillsborough]] estate from Lindsay in 1965.

Crosby and Lindsay Howard formed [[Binglin Stable]] to race and breed thoroughbred horses at a ranch in [[Moorpark, California|Moorpark]] in [[Ventura County, California]]. They also established the Binglin stock farm in Argentina, where they raced horses at Hipódromo de Palermo in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires]]. A number of Argentine-bred horses were purchased and shipped to race in the United States. On August 12, 1938, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club hosted a $25,000 winner-take-all [[match race]] won by Charles S. Howard's [[Seabiscuit]] over Binglin's horse Ligaroti. In 1943, Binglin's horse Don Bingo won the [[Suburban Handicap]] at [[Belmont Park]] in [[Elmont, New York]].

The Binglin Stable partnership came to an end in 1953 as a result of a liquidation of assets by Crosby, who needed to raise enough funds to pay the hefty federal and state inheritance taxes on his deceased wife's estate.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> The [[Bing Crosby Breeders' Cup Handicap]] at [[Del Mar Racetrack]] is named in his honor.

Crosby was also a co-owner of the British colt [[Meadow Court]], with jockey [[Johnny Longden]]'s friend [[Max Bell]]. Meadow Court won the 1965 [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]], and the [[Irish Derby]]. In the Irish Derby's winner's circle at the [[Curragh]], Crosby sang "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling".

Though Crosby's stables had some success, he often joked about his horseracing failures as part of his radio appearances. "Crosby's horse finally came in" became a running gag.

==Sports==
Crosby had an interest in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, [[Gonzaga Bulldogs football|Gonzaga]] head coach [[Mike Pecarovich]] appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach.<ref>[http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Libraries/Foley-Library/Departments/Special-Collections/Collections/Bing-Crosby-Collection/CrosbyandGonzaga2.asp Bing Crosby and Gonzaga University: 1925&nbsp;– 1951], Gonzaga University, retrieved June 6, 2011.</ref> From 1946 until the end of his life, he was part-owner of baseball's [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Although he was passionate about his team, he was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the [[1960 World Series]], choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to the game on the radio. Crosby had the [[NBC]] telecast of the game recorded on [[kinescope]]. The game was one of the most famous in baseball history, capped off by [[Bill Mazeroski]]'s [[walk-off home run]]. He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/sports/baseball/24crosby.html?_r=1&src=mv |title=In Bing Crosby's Wine Cellar, Vintage Baseball |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |work=The New York Times |date=September 23, 2010 |accessdate=September 25, 2010}}</ref> The restored broadcast was shown on [[MLB Network]] in December 2010.

Crosby was also an avid golfer, and in 1978, he and Bob Hope were voted the [[Bob Jones Award]], the highest honor given by the [[United States Golf Association]] in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship. He is a member of the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]. In 1937, Bing Crosby hosted the first [[AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am|National Pro-Am Golf Championship]], the 'Crosby Clambake' as it was popularly known, at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in Rancho Santa Fe, California, the event's location prior to World War II. Sam Snead won the first tournament, in which the first place check was for $500. After the war, the event resumed play in 1947 on golf courses in Pebble Beach, where it has been played ever since. Now the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, it has been a leading event in the world of professional golf.

Crosby first took up golf at 12 as a caddy, dropped it, and started again in 1930 with some fellow cast members in Hollywood during the filming of ''[[The King of Jazz]]''. Crosby was accomplished at the sport, with a two handicap. He competed in both the [[The Amateur Championship|British]] and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th at [[Cypress Point Club|Cypress Point]].

==Personal life==
[[File:Crosby Brothers-older sons of Bing Crosby 1959.JPG|thumb|Crosby's sons from his first marriage in 1959. From left: The four Crosby brothers- Dennis, Gary, Lindsey and Philip in 1959.]]
Crosby was married twice. His first wife was actress/nightclub singer [[Dixie Lee]], to whom he was married from 1930 until her death from [[ovarian cancer]] in 1952; they had four sons: [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary]], twins [[Dennis Crosby|Dennis]] and [[Phillip Crosby|Phillip]], and [[Lindsay Crosby|Lindsay]]. The 1947 film ''[[Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman]]'' is indirectly based on Lee's life. After her death, Crosby had relationships with model/Goldwyn Girl [[Pat Sheehan (model)|Pat Sheehan]] (who married his son Dennis in 1958) and actresses [[Inger Stevens]] and [[Grace Kelly]] before marrying the actress [[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]], who converted to Catholicism, in 1957. They had three children: [[Harry Crosby (actor)|Harry Lillis III]] (who played Bill in ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]''), [[Mary Frances Crosby|Mary]] (best known for portraying [[Kristin Shepard]], who shot [[J. R. Ewing]] on TV's ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''), and [[Nathaniel Crosby|Nathaniel]].

Crosby was a [[Republican Party (United States)|registered Republican]], and actively campaigned for [[Wendell Willkie]] in 1940 against [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]], arguing that no man should serve more than two terms in the White House. After Willkie lost, Crosby decreed that he would never again make any open political contributions.

Crosby reportedly had an alcohol problem in his youth, and may have been dismissed from Paul Whiteman's orchestra because of it, but he later got a handle on his drinking. According to Giddins, Crosby told his son Gary to stay away from alcohol ("It killed your mother."<ref name=Giddins181>Giddins, 2001, p. 181.</ref>) 

After Crosby's death, his eldest son, Gary, wrote a highly critical memoir, ''Going My Own Way'', depicting his father as cruel, cold, remote, and both physically and psychologically abusive.<ref name=lk>{{cite web|last=Haller |first=Scot |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20084544,00.html |title=The Sad Ballad of Bing and His Boys&nbsp;– Child Abuse, Kids & Family Life, Bing Crosby |work=People |date=March 21, 1983 |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}</ref>

Gary Crosby wrote:

<blockquote>We had to keep a close watch on our actions... When one of us left a sneaker or pair of underpants lying around, he had to tie the offending object on a string and wear it around his neck until he went off to bed that night. Dad called it "the Crosby [[lavalier]]". At the time the humor of the name escaped me...

"Satchel Ass" or "Bucket Butt" or "My Fat-assed Kid". That's how he introduced me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me into his office and had me drop my trousers... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...

When I saw ''Going My Way'' I was as moved as they were by the character he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming down hard on the kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All the way back to the house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.<ref name="NoSpank">{{cite book| title=Going My Own Way| url=http://www.nospank.net/crosbyg.htm| author=Gary Crosby| date=March 1983| publisher=Doubleday| isbn=978-0-385-17055-0}}</ref></blockquote>

However, younger son Phillip vociferously disputed his brother Gary's claims about their father. Around the time Gary made his claim, Phillip stated to the press that "Gary is a whining...crybaby, walking around with a 2-by-4 and just daring people to nudge it off."<ref name=polc>{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-01-20/bay-area/17409442_1_gary-crosby-bing-crosby-philip-crosby/2 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Leah Garchik's Personals | date=January 20, 2004}}</ref> However, Phillip did not deny that Crosby believed in corporal punishment.<ref name=polc /> In an interview with [[People (magazine)|People]], Phillip stated that "we never got an extra whack or a cuff we didn't deserve."<ref name=polc /> During a later interview conducted in 1999 by the [[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]], Phillip said:

<blockquote>My dad was not the monster my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond memories of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote ''Going My Own Way'' out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the only way he could get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.<ref name="Grudens, 2002, p. 59">Grudens, 2002, p. 59.</ref></blockquote>

Gary's other brothers, Dennis and Lindsay, both supported their brother's take on their father, with Lindsay stating, "I'm glad [Gary] did it. I hope it clears up a lot of the old lies and rumors."<ref name=lk />

It was revealed that Crosby's will had established a blind trust, with none of the sons receiving an inheritance until they reached the age of 65.<ref name="Dunn">{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-13/local/me-242_1_lindsay-crosby| first=Ashley| last=Dunn| date=December 13, 1989|work=Los Angeles Times | title=Lindsay Crosby Suicide Laid to End of Inheritance Income| accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>

[[Nathaniel Crosby]], Crosby's youngest son from his second marriage, was a high-level golfer who won the [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] at age 19 in 1981, at the time the youngest-ever winner of that event. [[Harry Crosby (actor)|Harry Crosby]] is an investment banker who occasionally makes singing appearances.

Widow [[Kathryn Crosby]] dabbled in local theater productions intermittently, and appeared in television tributes to her late husband. [[Denise Crosby]], Dennis Crosby's daughter, is also an actress and is known for her role as [[Tasha Yar]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', and for the recurring role of the Romulan [[Sela (Star Trek)|Sela]] (daughter of Tasha Yar) after her withdrawal from the series as a regular cast member. She also appeared in the film adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Pet Sematary]]''. In 2006, Crosby's niece, Carolyn Schneider, published the laudatory book ''Me and Uncle Bing''.

==Failing health and death==
[[File:Bing Crosby's grave.JPG|thumb|right|Crosby's grave at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]], California]]
Following his recovery from a life-threatening fungal infection of his right lung in 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement to start a new spate of albums and concerts. In March 1977, after videotaping a concert for CBS to commemorate his 50th anniversary in show business and with Bob Hope looking on, Crosby backed off the stage and fell into an [[orchestra pit]], rupturing a disc in his back and requiring a month in the hospital. His first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977; when the power went out, he continued singing without amplification. In September, Crosby, his family, and singer [[Rosemary Clooney]] began a concert tour of England that included two weeks at the [[London Palladium]]. While in England, Crosby recorded his final album, ''Seasons'', and his final TV Christmas special with guest [[David Bowie]] (which aired several months after Crosby's death). His last concert was in [[The Brighton Centre]] four days before his death, with British entertainer Dame [[Gracie Fields]] in attendance. Although it has been reported that Crosby's last photograph was taken with Fields,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} he was photographed playing golf on the day he died.<ref>Thomas, 1977, p. 86–87.</ref>

At the conclusion of his work in England, Crosby flew alone to Spain to hunt and play golf. Shortly after 6&nbsp;p.m. on October 14, Crosby collapsed and died of a massive heart attack on the green after a round of 18 holes of golf near Madrid where he and a golfing partner had just defeated two Spanish pros. It is widely written that his last words were "That was a great game of golf, fellas."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HFI/is_5_54/ai_101967390 |title=The Bing dynasty: on the 100th anniversary of Crosby's birth, we celebrate the granddaddy of celebrity golf |publisher=Golf Digest |date=2003-05 |accessdate=November 2, 2008 | first=Tom | last=Callahan}}</ref> In ''[[Bob Hope's Confessions of a Hooker: My Lifelong Love Affair With Golf]]'', the comedian recounts hearing that Crosby had been advised by a physician in England to play only nine holes of golf because of his heart condition.
