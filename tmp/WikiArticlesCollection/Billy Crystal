==Career==
===Television===
Crystal returned to [[New York City]] and performed regularly at ''[[The Improv]]'' and ''[[Catch a Rising Star]]''. In 1976, Crystal appeared on an episode of ''[[All in the Family]]''. He was on the dais for [[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]] of [[Muhammad Ali]] on February 19, 1976, where he did [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impression]]s of both Ali and sportscaster [[Howard Cosell]]. He was scheduled to appear on the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live|NBC Saturday Night]]'' (later renamed ''Saturday Night Live'') (October 11, 1975), but his sketch was cut.<ref name="actors">{{cite episode | title = Billy Crystal, 2nd Visit | series = Inside the Actors Studio | airdate = October 8, 2007 | url = http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Billy_Crystal_-_2nd_Visit | network = Bravo | season = 13 | number = 1307 | credits = Lipton, James (host)}}</ref> He did perform on episode 17 of that first season, doing a monologue of an old jazz man capped by the line "Can you dig it?

[[File:Soap full cast 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Billy Crystal (seated at left of table) as Jodie Dallas in a 1977 promotional photo of the premiere for the TV sitcom ''Soap''.]]
Crystal's earliest prominent role was as [[Jodie Dallas]] on ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', one of the first unambiguously homosexual characters in the cast of an American television series. He continued in the role during the series' entire 1977–1981 run.

In 1982, Billy Crystal hosted his own variety show, ''The Billy Crystal Comedy Hour'' on NBC. When Crystal arrived to shoot the fifth episode, he learned it had been canceled after only the first two aired.<ref>{{cite book | title= Still Foolin' Em | first= Billy |last=Crystal | page= 93 | year= 2013 | publisher = [[Henry Holt and Company]] | isbn=9780805098204}}</ref> After hosting ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1984, he joined the regular cast.<ref name="actors"/> His most famous recurring sketch was his parody of [[Fernando Lamas]], Fernando, a smarmy talk-show host whose [[catchphrase]], "You look... mahvelous!," became a media sensation.<ref name="actors"/> Crystal subsequently released an album of his stand-up material titled ''Mahvelous!'' in 1985, as well as the single "You Look Marvelous", which peaked at No. 58 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in the US, and No. 17 in Canada.  Also in the 1980s, Crystal starred in an episode of [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'' as the smartest of the three little pigs.

In 1996, Crystal was the guest star of the third episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Billy Crystal hosted three [[Grammy Award]]s Telecasts: the 29th Grammys; the 30th Grammys; and the 31st Grammys.

===Acting in film and hosting the Oscars===
Crystal's first film role was in [[Joan Rivers]]'s 1978 film ''[[Rabbit Test (film)|Rabbit Test]]''. Crystal also made game show appearances such as ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[All Star Secrets]]'' and ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $20,000 Pyramid]]''. He holds the record for getting his contestant partner to the top of the pyramid in winner's circle in the fastest time, 26 seconds.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Crystal appeared briefly in the [[Rob Reiner]] "[[rockumentary]]" ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984) as Morty The Mime, a waiter dressed as a mime at one of Spinal Tap's parties. He shared the scene with a then-unknown, non-speaking [[Dana Carvey]], stating famously that "Mime is money." He later starred in the action comedy ''[[Running Scared (1986 film)|Running Scared]]'' (1986) and was directed by Reiner again in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987), in a comedic supporting role as "Miracle Max." Reiner got Crystal to accept the part by saying, "How would you like to play Mel Brooks?" Reiner also allowed Crystal to ad-lib, and his parting shot, "Hev fun stawming de kessel!" (i.e., "Have fun storming the castle!"), is a frequently-quoted line.

Reiner directed Crystal for a third time in the romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), in which Crystal starred alongside [[Meg Ryan]] and for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]. The film has since become an iconic classic for the genre and is Crystal's most celebrated film. Crystal then starred in the award-winning buddy comedy ''[[City Slickers]]'' (1991), which proved very successful both commercially and critically and for which Crystal was nominated for his second Golden Globe. The film was followed by a sequel, which was less successful. In 1992, he played the narrator in ''[[Dr. Seuss|Doctor Seuss]] Video Classics: '''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'''''.

Following the significant success of these films, Crystal wrote, directed, and starred in ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'' (1992) and ''[[Forget Paris]]'' (1995). In the former, Crystal played a serious role in aging makeup, as an egotistical comedian who reflects back on his career, although the character was from his ''SNL'' days. Though some of his subsequent films were not as well received as his earlier hits, Crystal had another success alongside [[Robert De Niro]] in [[Harold Ramis]]' mobster comedy ''[[Analyze This]]'' (1999). More recent performances include roles in ''[[America's Sweethearts]]'' (2001), the sequel ''[[Analyze That]]'' (2002), and ''[[Parental Guidance (film)|Parental Guidance]]'' (2012).

He directed the made-for-television movie ''[[61*]]'' (2001) based on [[Roger Maris]]'s and [[Mickey Mantle]]'s race to break [[Babe Ruth]]'s single-season home run record in 1961. This earned Crystal an [[Emmy]] nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special.

Crystal was originally asked to provide the voice of [[Buzz Lightyear]] in ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995) but turned it down, a decision he later regretted due to the popularity of the series.<ref name="actors"/> Crystal later went on to provide the voice of Mike Wazowski in the blockbuster Pixar film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001), and reprised his role in the prequel, ''[[Monsters University]]'', which was released in June 2013. Crystal also provided the voice of [[Calcifer]] in the English version of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'' (2004).  

Crystal hosted the [[Academy Awards]] broadcast in 1990–1993, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2012.  His hosting was critically praised, resulting in two emmy wins for hosting and writing the 63rd Academy Awards and an emmy win for writing the 64th Academy Awards.  He returned as emcee for the 2012 Oscar ceremony, after [[Eddie Murphy]] backed out of hosting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/11/10/billy-crystal-to-return-as-host-for-84th-academy-awards/110348/?utm_campaign=WP|title= Billy Crystal to return as host for 84th Academy Awards|publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com|accessdate=2012-04-10}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=August 2013}} His nine times as the M.C. is second only to [[Bob Hope]]'s 18 in most ceremonies hosted. At the [[83rd Academy Awards]] ceremony in 2011, he appeared as a presenter for a digitally inserted Bob Hope and before doing so was given a standing ovation. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] said when Crystal came onstage about two hours into the show, he got the first laughs of the broadcast.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110227/OSCARS/110229986 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Oscars: "King" wins, show loses}}</ref>  Crystal's hosting gigs have regularly included an introductory video segment in which he comedically inserts himself into scenes of that year's films in addition to a song following his opening monologue.

===Broadway===
Crystal won the 2005 [[Tony Award]] for Best Special Theatrical Event for ''700 Sundays'', a two-act, [[One-person show|one-man play]], which he conceived and wrote about his parents and his childhood growing up on [[Long Island]].<ref name="actors"/> He toured the U.S. with the show in 2006 and Australia in 2007.

Following the initial success of the play, Crystal wrote the book ''700 Sundays'' for [[Warner Books]], which was published on October 31, 2005. In conjunction with the book and the play that also paid tribute to his uncle, [[Milt Gabler]], Crystal produced two CD compilations: ''Billy Crystal Presents: The Milt Gabler Story'', which featured his uncle's most influential recordings from [[Billie Holiday]]'s "[[Strange Fruit]]" to "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" by [[Bill Haley & His Comets]]; and ''Billy Remembers Billie'' featuring Crystal's favorite Holiday recordings.

In the fall of 2013, he brought the show back to Broadway for a two-month run at the [[Imperial Theatre]].

On September 6, 2005, on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', Crystal and [[Jay Leno]] were the first celebrities to sign a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle to be auctioned off for Gulf Coast relief.<ref>{{cite news | agency=Associated Press |title=Leno's autographed bike raises $500,000 | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-09-30-leno-bike_x.htm | work= USAToday | date=September 30, 2005}}</ref>

Crystal has participated in the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] [[Museum of Tolerance]] in Los Angeles. Portraying himself in a video, Crystal introduces museum guests to the genealogy wing of the museum.{{cn|date=September 2013}}

==Baseball==
On March 12, 2008, Crystal signed a minor league contract, for a single day, to play with the [[New York Yankees]], and was invited to the team's major league spring training. He wore uniform number 60, in honor of his upcoming 60th birthday.<ref>{{cite news | title = Billy Crystal to sign contract with Yankees | url = http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=ApQysfnqvYEYnzAzS7waMwc5nYcB?slug=ap-yankees-crystal&prov=ap&type=lgns| publisher = Yahoo | date = March 10, 2008}}</ref> On March 13, in a spring training game against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], Crystal led off as the [[designated hitter]]. He managed to make contact, fouling a [[fastball]] up the [[first base]] line, but was eventually struck out by Pirates pitcher [[Paul Maholm]] on six pitches and was later replaced in the batting order by [[Johnny Damon]].<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Chris Girandola&nbsp;/&nbsp;Special to MLB.com |url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080313&content_id=2423946&vkey=spt2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=nyy |title=Crystal strikes out in only at-bat |publisher=Newyork.yankees.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-04}}</ref> He was released on March 14, his 60th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/23566549/ |title=Yankees release Billy Crystal on 61st birthday - Baseball |publisher=Nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=March 14, 2008 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>

Crystal's boyhood idol was Yankee Hall of Fame legend [[Mickey Mantle]] who had signed a program for him when Crystal attended a game where Mantle had hit a home run. Years later on ''[[The Dinah Shore Show]]'', in one of his first television appearances, Crystal met Mantle in person and had Mantle re-sign the same program. Crystal would be good friends with Mickey Mantle until Mantle's death in 1995. He and [[Bob Costas]] together wrote the eulogy Costas read at Mantle's funeral, and [[George Steinbrenner]] then invited Crystal to emcee the unveiling of Mantle's monument at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. In his 2013 memoir ''Still Foolin' 'Em'', Crystal writes that after the ceremony, near the Yankee clubhouse, he was punched in the stomach by [[Joe DiMaggio]], who was angry at Crystal for not having introduced him to the crowd as the "Greatest living player."

Crystal also was well known for his impressions of Yankee Hall of Famer turned broadcaster [[Phil Rizzuto]]. Rizzuto, known for his quirks calling games, did not travel to [[Anaheim, California]] in 1996 to call the game for [[WPIX]]. Instead, Crystal joined the broadcasters in the booth and pretended to be Rizzuto for a few minutes during the August 31 game.

Although a lifelong Yankee fan,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/sports/baseball/19crystal.html?_r=1&8dpc | work=The New York Times | title=Feeling Lonely Behind the Facade | first=Billy | last=Crystal | date=April 19, 2009 | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref> he is a part-owner of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], even earning a [[World Series ring]] in 2001 when the Diamondbacks beat his beloved Yankees.<ref>{{cite news |title=Billy Crystal Strikes Out in New Career |publisher=The Insider |url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/727182_Billy_Crystal_Strikes_Out_in_New_Career |date=March 14, 2008 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}</ref>

In the movie ''City Slickers'', Crystal wears a [[New York Mets]] baseball cap.  In the 1986 film ''[[Running Scared (1986 film)|Running Scared]]'', Crystal's character is an avid [[Chicago Cubs]] fan, wearing a Cubs' jersey in several scenes. In the 2012 film ''[[Parental Guidance (film)|Parental Guidance]]'', Crystal's character is the announcer for the Minor League Baseball team the [[Fresno Grizzlies]] and aspires to announce for their major league affiliate, the [[San Francisco Giants]].
