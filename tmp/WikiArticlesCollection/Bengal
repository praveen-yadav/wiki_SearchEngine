'''Bengal''' {{IPAc-en|b|E|N|'|g|aw|l}} ({{lang-bn|বাংলা}} {{audio|bangla.ogg|''Bangla''}}, {{lang|bn|বঙ্গ}} ''Bongo'' or ''Bônggô'')  is a historical, geographical and ethno-linguistic region in [[Asia]], which forms the eastern region of the [[Indian subcontinent]], at the apex of the [[Bay of Bengal]], which was [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|politically divided in 1947]], and the region today comprises the nation of [[Bangladesh]] and the [[States of India|Indian state]] of [[West Bengal]], although some regions of the previous [[History of Bengal|kingdoms of Bengal]] are now part of the neighbouring Indian states of [[Assam]], [[Tripura]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkand]] and [[Odisha]]. The region of Bengal is natively inhabited by [[Bengali people]] ({{lang|bn|বাঙালি}} ''Bangali'') who speak the [[Bengali language]] ({{lang|bn|বাংলা}} ''Bangla'').

The region of Bengal is one of the most densely populated regions on Earth, with an estimated population of more than 250 million people and a population density exceeding 900/km². Most of the Bengal region lies in the low-lying [[Ganges]]–[[Brahmaputra]] River [[River delta|Delta]] or [[Ganges Delta]], the world's largest delta. In the southern part of the delta lies the [[Sundarbans]]—the world's largest [[mangrove]] forest and home of the [[Bengal tiger]]. In the coastal southeast lies [[Cox's Bazar]], the world's longest beach with a length of 120&nbsp;km (75&nbsp;mi). Though the population of the region is mostly rural and agrarian, two [[megacities]], [[Kolkata]] (previously Calcutta) and [[Dhaka]] (previously Dacca); are located in Bengal. The Bengal region is renowned for its rich [[Bengali literature|literary]] and [[Culture of Bengal|cultural heritage]] as well as its immense political and intellectual contribution to [[South Asian history]] through the [[Bengal Renaissance]], [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary activities]], its central role in the [[Indian independence movement]], the [[Bengali language movement]], and the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
{{Main|Bengali people}}
The exact origin of the word {{lang|bn|বাংলা}} ''Bangla'' and {{lang|bn|বঙ্গ}} ''Bongo'' or Bengal is unknown, though the word is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe called ''Bang'' that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC.<ref name="congress">{{cite book

It could also be derived from the word ''[[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]],'' which was a kingdom in the Bengal region during the times of [[Mahabharata]] as mentioned in [[Sanskrit literature]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/623011/Vanga "Vanga" in the Encyclopedia Britannica]</ref>

About 20,000 people live on chars. Chars are temporary islands formed by the deposition of sediments eroded off the banks of the Ganges in West Bengal which often disappear in the monsoon season. They are made of very fertile soil. The inhabitants of chars are not recognised by the Government of West Bengal on the grounds that it is not known whether they are Bengalis or Bangladeshi refugees. Consequently, no identification documents are issued to char-dwellers who cannot benefit from health care, barely survive due to very poor sanitation and are prevented from emigrating to the mainland to find jobs when they have turned 14. On a particular char it was reported that 13% of women died at childbirth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wanderinggaia.com|title=Wandering Gaia|publisher="The Give and Take of the Ganges" WordPress.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref>

==Economy==
Agriculture is the leading occupation in the region. Rice is the staple food crop. Other food crops are [[pulses]], potato, maize, and [[oil seeds]]. [[Jute]] is the principal [[cash crop]]. Tea is also produced commercially; the region is well known for [[Darjeeling tea|Darjeeling]] and other high-quality teas.

Historically, Europe once regarded Bengal as  "the richest country to trade with".<ref>

The common [[Bengali language]] and culture anchors the shared tradition of two parts of politically divided Bengal. Bengal has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by the ''[[Charyapada]]'', ''[[Mangalkavya]]'', ''[[Shreekrishna Kirtana]]'', ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'' or ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]''. Bengali literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. [[Chandidas]]), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. [[Alaol]]). During the [[Bengal Renaissance]] of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[Bengali literature]] was modernised through the works of authors such as [[Michael Madhusudan Dutta]], [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]].

The [[Baul]] tradition is a unique heritage of Bangla folk music.<ref name=baulbengalonline>{{cite web

}}</ref> Other folk music forms include [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]] and [[Bhawaiya]]. Folk music in Bengal is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], a one-stringed instrument. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]], and [[tabla]]. The region also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]].

Bengal had also been the harbinger of [[modernism]] in [[Indian art]]s. Abanindranath Tagore, one of the important 18th century artist from Bengal is often referred to as the father of Indian modern art. He had established the first non-British art academy in India known as the Kalabhavan within the premises of [[Santiniketan]]. Santiniketan in course of time had produced many important Indian artists like [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Benode Bihari Mukherjee]] and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]. In the post-independence era, Bengal had produced important artists like [[Somenath Hore]], [[Meera Mukherjee]] and [[Ganesh Pyne]].

Rice and fish are traditional favourite foods, leading to a saying that in Bengali, ''mach ar bhaath bangali baanaay'', that translates as "fish and rice make a Bengali".<ref name=machhe>{{cite web

Bengali women commonly wear the ''[[sari|shaŗi]]'' and the [[salwar kameez]], often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs. In urban areas, many women and men wear Western-style attire. Among men, European dressing has greater acceptance. Men also wear traditional costumes such as the ''[[kurta]]'' with ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[pyjama]]'', often on religious occasions. The [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt, is widely worn by Bangladeshi men.

The greatest religious festivals are the two [[religious festival|Eids]] ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]]) for the Muslims, and the autumnal [[Durga|Durga Puja]] for Hindus.<ref name=durgapuja>{{cite web
