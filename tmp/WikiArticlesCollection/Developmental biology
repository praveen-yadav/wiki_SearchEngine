'''Developmental biology''' is the study of the process by which [[organisms]] grow and develop, and is closely related to [[Ontogeny]].  Modern developmental biology studies the genetic control of [[cell growth]], [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] and [[morphogenesis]], which is the process that gives rise to [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and [[anatomy]], but also [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] and [[biological aging|aging]],.<ref name=WolpertAging>{{cite book | title=Principles of development| edition=1st| author=Wolpert L, Beddington R, Jessell T, Lawrence P, Meyerowitz E, Smith J| year=1998| page=437| publisher=Oxford university press| isbn=}}</ref>

== Perspectives ==
The development of a new life is a spectacular process and represents a masterpiece of temporal and spatial control of gene expression. Developmental genetics studies the effect that genes have in a [[phenotype]], given normal or abnormal [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] parameters. The findings of developmental biology can help to understand developmental abnormalities such as [[chromosome abnormality|chromosomal aberration]]s that cause [[Down syndrome]]. An understanding of the specialization of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] during [[embryogenesis]] has provided information on how [[stem cell]]s specialize into specific tissues and organs. This information has led, for example, to the [[cloning]] of specific organs for medical purposes.<ref>{{cite journal

Many developmental models are used to elucidate the [[physiology]] and molecular basis of this cellular process. Similarly, a deeper understanding of developmental biology can foster greater progress in the treatment of [[congenital disorder|congenital]] disorders and diseases, e.g. studying [[sex determination and differentiation (human)|human sex determination]] can lead to treatment for disorders such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].

== Studied phenomena ==

=== Cell differentiation ===
[[Cellular differentiation|Differentiation]] is the formation of [[cell type]]s, from what is originally one cell – the [[zygote]] or [[spore]]. The formation of cell types such as [[nerve cell]]s occurs with a number of intermediary, less differentiated cell types. A cell stays a certain cell type by maintaining a particular pattern of [[gene expression]].<ref name=WolpertDifferentiation>{{cite book | title=Principles of development| edition=2nd| author=Wolpert L, Beddington R, Jessell T, Lawrence P, Meyerowitz E, Smith J| year=2002| pages=293–295| publisher=Oxford university press| isbn=0-19-879291-3}}</ref> This depends on regulatory genes, e.g. for [[transcription factor]]s and signaling proteins. These can take part in self-perpetuating circuits in the [[gene regulatory network]], circuits that can involve several cells that [[cell signaling|communicate]] with each other.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Gene regulation: gene control network in development |journal=Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct |volume=36 |pages=191 |year=2007 |pmid=17291181 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.35.040405.102002 |author1=Ben-Tabou de-Leon S |author2=Davidson EH |author-separator=, |last2=Davidson}}</ref> External signals can alter gene expression by activating a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]], which triggers a [[signaling cascade]] that affects transcription factors. For example, the withdrawal of growth factors from [[myoblast]]s causes them to stop dividing and instead differentiate into [[muscle cell]]s.<ref name=WolpertDifferentiationmodels>{{cite book | title=Principles of development| edition=2nd| author=Wolpert L, Beddington R, Jessell T, Lawrence P, Meyerowitz E, Smith J| year=2002| pages=304–307| publisher=Oxford university press| isbn=0-19-879291-3}}</ref>

=== Embryonic development ===
[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|300px|The initial stages of [[human embryogenesis]].]]
[[Embryogenesis]] is the step in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] after [[fertilisation]] – the development of the [[embryo]], starting from the [[zygote]] (fertilised egg). Organisms can differ drastically in how the embryo develops, especially when they belong to different [[phylum|phyla]]. For example, embryonal development in [[placental mammal]]s starts with [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] of the zygote into eight uncommited cells, which then form a ball ([[morula]]). The outer cells become the [[trophectoderm]] or trophoblast, which will form in combination with maternal uterine endometrial tissue the [[placenta]], needed for fetal nurturing via maternal blood, while inner cells become the [[inner cell mass]] that will form all fetal organs (the bridge between these two parts eventually forms the umbilical cord). In contrast, the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] zygote first forms  a sausage-shaped [[syncytium]], which is still one cell but with many [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]].<ref name=WolpertOrganisms>{{cite book | title=Principles of development| edition=2nd| author=Wolpert L, Beddington R, Jessell T, Lawrence P, Meyerowitz E, Smith J| year=2002| pages=41–50, 493| publisher=Oxford university press| isbn=0-19-879291-3}}</ref>

[[Pattern formation|Patterning]] is important for determining which cells develop into which organs. This is mediated by signaling between adjacent cells by proteins on their surfaces, and by gradients of signaling secreted molecules.<ref name=Christ1998/> An example is [[retinoic acid]], which forms a gradient in the head to tail direction in animals. Retinoic acid enters cells and activates [[Hox gene]]s in a concentration-dependent manner – Hox genes differ in how much retinoic acid they require for activation and will thus show differential rostral expression boundaries, in a colinear fashion with their genomic order. As Hox genes code for transcription factors, this causes different activated combinations of both Hox and other genes in discrete anteroposterior transverse segments of the neural tube ([[neuromeres]]) and related patterns in surrounding tissues, such as branchial arches, lateral mesoderm, neural crest, skin and endoderm, in the head to tail direction.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Retinoids and Hox genes |journal=FASEB J. |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=969–78 |year=1996 |month=July |pmid=8801179 |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8801179 |author1=Marshall H |author2=Morrison A |author3=Studer M |author4=Pöpperl H |author5=Krumlauf R |author-separator=, |last2=Morrison |last3=Studer |last4=Pöpperl |last5=Krumlauf}}</ref> This is important for e.g. the [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]] of the [[Vertebral column|spine]] in vertebrates.<ref name=Christ1998>{{cite journal |title=Segmentation of the vertebrate body |journal=Anat. Embryol. |volume=197 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=9462855 |doi= 10.1007/s004290050116|url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00429/bibs/7197001/71970001.htm |author1=Christ B |author2=Schmidt C |author3=Huang R |author4=Wilting J |author5=Brand-Saberi B |author-separator=, |last2=Schmidt |last3=Huang |last4=Wilting |last5=Brand-Saberi}}</ref>

Embryonic development does not always proceed correctly, and errors can result in [[birth defect]]s or [[miscarriage]]. Often the reason is genetic ([[mutation]] or [[chromosome abnormality]]), but there can be environmental influence (like [[teratogen]]s) or stochastic events.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Monitoring for congenital malformations |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=7 |issue= |pages=237–66 |year=1986 |pmid=3521645 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pu.07.050186.001321 |url= |author1=Holtzman NA |author2=Khoury MJ |author-separator=, |last2=Khoury}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolf U |title=Identical mutations and phenotypic variation |journal=Hum Genet |volume=100 |issue=3–4 |pages=305–21 |year=1997 |pmid=9272148 |doi=10.1007/s004390050509}}</ref> Abnormal development caused by mutation is also of evolutionary interest as it provides a mechanism for changes in [[body plan]] (''see [[evolutionary developmental biology]]'').<ref>{{cite journal |title=Network Evolution of Body Plans |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e2772 |year=2008 |pmid=18648662 |pmc=2464711 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002772 |author1=Fujimoto K |author2=Ishihara S |author3=Kaneko K |author-separator=, |editor1-last=Hogeweg |editor1-first=Paulien |editor1-link = Paulien Hogeweg |last2=Ishihara |last3=Kaneko}}</ref>

=== Growth ===
Growth is the enlargement of a tissue or organism. Growth continues after the embryonal stage, and occurs through [[cell growth|cell proliferation]], enlargement of cells or accumulation of extracellular material. In plants, growth results in an adult organism that is strikingly different from the embryo. The proliferating cells tend to be distinct from differentiated cells (''see [[stem cell]] and [[progenitor cell]]''). In some tissues proliferating cells are restricted to specialised areas, such as the [[growth plate]]s of [[bone]]s.<ref name=WolpertGrowth>{{cite book | title=Principles of development| edition=2nd| author=Wolpert L, Beddington R, Jessell T, Lawrence P, Meyerowitz E, Smith J| year=2002| pages=467–482| publisher=Oxford university press| isbn=0-19-879291-3}}</ref> But some stem cells [[cell migration|migrate]] to where they are needed, such as [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s which can migrate from the [[bone marrow]] to form e.g. muscle, bone or adipose tissue.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Concise review: mesenchymal stem cells: their phenotype, differentiation capacity, immunological features, and potential for homing |journal=Stem Cells |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=2739–49 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17656645 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.2007-0197 |author1=Chamberlain G |author2=Fox J |author3=Ashton B |author4=Middleton J |author-separator=, |last2=Fox |last3=Ashton |last4=Middleton}}</ref> The size of an organ frequently determines its growth, as in the case of the [[liver]] which grows back to its previous size if a part is removed. [[Growth factor]]s, such as [[fibroblast growth factor]]s in the animal embryo and [[growth hormone]] in juvenile mammals, also control the extent of growth.<ref name=WolpertGrowth/>

=== Metamorphosis ===
Most animals have a [[larva]]l stage, with a body plan different from that of the adult organism. The larva abruptly develops into an adult in a process called [[metamorphosis]]. For example, [[caterpillar]]s (butterfly larvae) are specialized for feeding whereas adult butterflies ([[imago]]s) are specialised for flight and reproduction. When the caterpillar has grown enough, it turns into an immobile [[pupa]]. Here, the imago develops from [[imaginal disc]]s found inside the larva.<ref>{{cite book | title=Developmental biology| edition=7th| author=Gilbert SF| year=2003| pages=575–585| publisher=Sinauer| isbn=0-87893-258-5}}</ref>

=== Regeneration ===
[[Regeneration (biology)|Regeneration]] is the reactivation of development so that a missing body part grows back. This phenomenon has been studied particularly in [[salamander]]s, where the adults can reconstruct a whole limb after it has been amputated.<ref name=GilbertRegen/> Researchers hope to one day be able to induce regeneration in humans (''see [[regenerative medicine]]'').<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stocum DL |title=Development. A tail of transdifferentiation |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5600 |pages=1901–3 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12471238 |doi=10.1126/science.1079853}}</ref> There is little spontaneous regeneration in adult humans, although the [[liver]] is a notable exception. Like for salamanders, the regeneration of the liver involves [[dedifferentiation]] of some cells to a more embryonal state.<ref name=GilbertRegen>{{cite book | title=Developmental biology| edition=7th| author=Gilbert SF| year=2003| pages=592–601| publisher=Sinauer| isbn=0-87893-258-5}}</ref>

== Developmental systems biology ==
Computer simulation of multicellular development is a research methodology to understand the function of the very complex processes involved in the development of organisms. This includes simulation of cell signaling, multicell interactions and regulatory genomic networks in development of multicellular structures and processes (see [[French flag model]] or [[:Category:Developmental biology journals]] for literature).  ''[[Genomes#Minimal genomes|Minimal genomes]]'' for minimal multicellular organisms may pave the way to understand such complex processes ''in vivo''.
