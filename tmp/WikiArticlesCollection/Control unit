The '''control unit''' is a component of a computer's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) which directs operation of the processor. It controls communication and co-ordination between input/output devices. It reads and interprets instructions and determines the sequence for processing the data.

It directs the operation of the other units by providing timing and control signals.
All computer resources are managed by the CU (Control Unit). It directs the flow of data between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the other devices
The control unit was historically <!-- reluctant to write "first" for "historically" without further research which, sorry, I'm not bothering about right now --> defined as one distinct part of the 1946 reference model of [[Von Neumann architecture]]. In modern computer designs, the control unit is typically an internal part of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]]<!-- or other device that directs its operation--> with its overall role and operation unchanged.

== Functions of the control unit ==
The control unit implements the [[instruction set]] of the CPU. It performs the tasks of fetching, decoding, managing execution and, finally, storing results. The control unit may manage the translation of instructions (not data) to micro-instructions and manage scheduling the micro-instructions between the various execution units. On some processors, the control unit may be further broken down into other units, such as a scheduling unit to handle scheduling or a retirement unit to deal with results coming from the pipeline. The control unit handles the main functions of the CPU.

The control unit is the circuitry that controls the flow of data through the processor, and coordinates the activities of the other units within it. In a way, it is the "brain within the brain", as it controls what happens inside the processor, which in turn controls the rest of the computer.
The examples of devices that require a control unit are CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs). The control unit receives external instructions or commands which it converts into a sequence of control signals that the control unit applies to the data path to implement a sequence of [[register-transfer level]] operations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Englander|first=Irv|title=The Architecture of Computer Hardware, Systems Software, & Networking, 4th Ed.|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0471-71542-9|page=200}}</ref>

== Hardwired control unit ==<!-- Front end processor redirects here -->

Hardwired control units are implemented through use of [[sequential logic]] units, featuring a finite number of gates that can generate specific results based on the instructions that were used to invoke those responses. Hardwired  control units are generally faster than microprogrammed designs.

Their design uses a fixed architecture&mdash;it requires changes in the wiring if the [[instruction set]] is modified or changed.
This architecture is preferred in [[Reduced instruction set computing|reduced instruction 
set computer]]s (RISC) as they use a simpler instruction set.

A controller that uses this approach can operate at high speed; however, it has little flexibility, and the complexity of the instruction set it can implement is limited. 

The hardwired approach has become less popular as computers have evolved. Previously, control units for CPUs used ad-hoc logic, and they were difficult to design.

== Microprogram control unit ==
{{main|Microcode}}

The idea of microprogramming was introduced by [[Maurice Wilkes]] in 1951 as an intermediate level to execute computer program instructions. Microprograms were organized as a sequence of ''microinstructions'' and stored in special control memory. The algorithm for the microprogram control unit is usually specified by [[flowchart]] description.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Barkalov | first1 = Alexander | title = Logic synthesis for FSM based control units / Alexander Barkalov and Larysa Titarenko | year = 2009 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | isbn = 978-3-642-04308-6 | pages =  }}</ref> The main advantage of the microprogram control unit is the simplicity of its structure.
