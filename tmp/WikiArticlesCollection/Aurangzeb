'''Abul Muzaffar Muhi-ud-Din Mohammad Aurangzeb''', (4 November 1618 - 3 March 1707) commonly known as '''Aurangzeb''' and by his imperial title '''Alamgir''' ("world-seizer or universe-seizer") was the sixth [[Mughal Emperor]] and ruled over most of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. His reign lasted for 49 years from 1658 until his death in 1707. Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and during his reign, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent. He was among the wealthiest of the Mughal rulers with an annual yearly tribute of £38,624,680 (in 1690). He was a pious Muslim, and his policies partly abandoned the legacy of [[Akbar#Religious_policy|Akbar's secularism]], which remains a very controversial aspect of his reign. During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the [[Mughal Empire]] to more than 3.2 million square kilometres and he ruled over a population estimated as being in the range of 100-150 million subjects. He was a strong and effective ruler, but with his death the great period of the [[Mughal dynasty]] came to an end, and central control of the sub-continent declined rapidly.

==Early life==
[[File:ShujaAurganzebMurad.jpg|thumb|upright|A painting from circa 1637 shows the brothers (left to right) [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]], Aurangzeb and [[Murad Baksh]] in their younger years.]]
Aurangzeb was born on 4 November 1618, in [[Dahod]], [[Gujarat]]. He was the third son and sixth child of [[Shah Jahan]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. His father was a governor of Gujarat at that time. In June 1626, after an unsuccessful rebellion by his father, Aurangzeb and his brother [[Dara Shikoh]] were kept as hostages under their grandparents' ([[Nur Jahan]] and [[Jahangir]]) [[Lahore]] court. On 26 February 1628, Shah Jahan was officially declared the Mughal Emperor, and Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents at [[Agra Fort]], where Aurangzeb received his formal education in [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. His daily allowance were fixed to {{Indian Rupee|link=Indian rupee}} 500, and while he spent his allowance on religious education and the study of history he accused his brothers of alcoholism and womanizing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

On 28 May 1633 Aurangzeb escaped death when a powerful [[war elephant]] stampeded through the Mughal Imperial encampment. He rode against the elephant and struck its trunk with a [[lance]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schimmel|first=Annemarie|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N7sewQQzOHUC&|year=2004|title=The empire of the great Mughals|publisher=Reaktion Books|place=London|isbn=1-86189-185-7|page=54}}
</ref> and successfully defended himself from being crushed. Aurnagzeb's valor was appreciated by his father who conferred him with the title ''[[Rao Bahadur|Bahadur]]'' (Brave) and had him weighed in gold and presented gifts worth {{INR}} 2 [[lakh]]s. This event was celebrated in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] verses and Aurangzeb said:<ref name="Hansen1986">{{cite book|author=Waldemar Hansen|title=The Peacock Throne: The Drama of Mogul India|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AV--abKg9GEC&pg=PA122|accessdate=23 November 2012|date=1 January 1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0225-4|pages=122–124}}</ref>

===Education===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
	
Aurangzeb's childhood teachers included [[Muhammad Saleh Kamboh]]. Aurangzeb had a keen mind and learnt quickly from his reading. He learned the ''[[Quran]]'' and the [[hadith]] very early and could readily quote from them. He mastered Arabic and Persian languages and learned [[Chagatai Turkic]] during his tenure at [[Kandahar Province]]. Aurangzeb was a prolific writer of letters and commentaries on petitions. He wrote Arabic with a vigorous [[calligraphy]]. Two richly bound and illuminated [[manuscript]]s written by him are located in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], with another copy preserved in [[Nizamuddin Dargah|Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah]].

Aurangzeb took up his new post as the Viceroy of the [[Deccan]] in 1636.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |chapter=Mogul Splendour: The successors of Akbar (1605 - 1707) |first=Jacques |last=Weber |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480-1950 |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2004 |origyear=1994 (Librarie Arthême Fayard, as ''L'Histoire de L'Inde Modern'')|isbn=9781843310044 |page=103|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> After Shah Jahan's vassals had been devastated by the alarming expansion of [[Ahmednagar]] during the reign of the [[Nizam Shahi]] boy-prince [[Murtaza Shah III]], the emperor dispatched Aurangzeb, who in 1636 brought the Nizam Shahi dynasty to an end.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. In 1637, Aurangzeb married the [[Safavid]] princess, [[Dilras Banu Begum]], also known as Rabia-ud-Daurani.

In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister, [[Jahanara Begum Sahib|Jahanara]], was burned when the chemicals in her perfume were ignited by a nearby lamp while in [[Agra]]. This event precipitated a family crisis with political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure when he returned to Agra three weeks after the event, instead of immediately. Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara back to health in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of Viceroy of the Deccan, Aurnagzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents, with that privilege being handed to Dara Shikoh, or associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 1645, he was barred from the court for seven months and mentioned his grief to fellow Mughal commanders. Thereafter, Shah Jahan appointed him governor of Gujarat where he served well and was rewarded for bringing stability.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} In 1647, Shah Jahan moved him from Gujarat to be governor of [[Balkh]], replacing Aurangzeb's younger brother, [[Murad Baksh]], who had proved ineffective there. The area was under attack from [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] tribes. Whilst the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force, so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents. The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land, which was devastated by war. With the onset of winter, he and his father had to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks, giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty. The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through snow to [[Kabul]]. By the end of this two-year campaign, into which Aurangzeb had been plunged at a late stage, a vast sum of money had been expended for little gain.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA1 |pages=132–133 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>

Further inauspicious military involvements followed, as Aurangzeb was appointed governor of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. His efforts in 1649 and 1652 to dislodge the [[Safavid]]s at [[Kandahar]], which they had recently retaken after a decade of Mughal control, both ended in failure as winter approached. The logistical problems of supplying an army at the extremity of the empire, combined with the poor quality of armaments and the intransigence of the opposition have been cited by John Richards as the reasons for failure, and a third attempt in 1653, led by Dara Shikoh, met with the same outcome.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA1 |pages=134–135 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>

Dara Shikoh's appointment followed the removal of Aurangzeb, who once again took the role of viceroy in the Deccan. He regretted this and harboured feelings that Dara had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's two ''[[jagir]]s'' (land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required from [[Malwa]] and Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son. Shah Jahan insisted that things could be improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation, but the efforts that were made proved too slow in producing results to satisfy the emperor.<ref name="Chandra2005p267" />

Aurangzeb proposed to resolve the situation by attacking the dynastic occupants of [[Golconda]] (the [[Qutb Shahi]]s) and [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]] (the [[Adil Shahi]]s). As an adjunct to resolving the financial difficulties, the proposal would also extend Mughal influence by accruing more lands. Again, he was to feel that Dara had exerted influence on his father: believing that he was on the verge of victory in both instances, Aurangzeb was frustrated that Shah Jahan chose then to settle for negotiations with the opposing forces rather than pushing for complete victory.<ref name="Chandra2005p267" />

===War of Succession===
[[File:Aurangzebs palace.jpg|thumb|[[Sepoy]]s loyal to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, maintain their positions around the palace, at Aurangabad, in 1658.]]
The four sons of Shah Jahan all held posts as governors during the lifetime of their father. The emperor favoured the eldest, Dara Shikoh, and this had caused resentment among the younger three, who sought at various times to strengthen alliances between themselves and against Dara. There was no Muslim tradition of [[primogeniture]] and historian [[Satish Chandra]] says that "In the ultimate resort, connections among the powerful military leaders, and military strength and capacity [were] the real arbiters."<ref name="Chandra2005p267" /> Jacques Weber, emeritus professor of modern history at the [[University of Nantes]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.univ-nantes.fr/weber-j |title=Jacques Weber |publisher=Université de Nantes |date=19 November 2009 |language=French |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> explains that "...&nbsp;the loyalties of these officials seem to have been motivated more by their own interests, the closeness of the family relation and above all the charisma of the pretenders than by ideological divides."<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |chapter=Mogul Splendour: The successors of Akbar (1605 - 1707) |first=Jacques |last=Weber |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480-1950 |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2004 |origyear=1994 (Librarie Arthême Fayard, as ''L'Histoire de L'Inde Modern'')|isbn=9781843310044 |page=96 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> The contest for power was primarily between Dara Shikoh and Auragnzeb because, although all four sons had demonstrated competence in their official roles, it was around these two that the supporting cast of officials and other influential people mostly circulated.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA151 |pages=151–152 |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> There were ideological differences&nbsp;— Dara was an intellectual and a religious liberal in the mould of Akbar, while Aurangzeb was much more conservative&nbsp;—&nbsp;but, as historians [[Barbara D.

Jahanara, certainly, interceded at various times on behalf of all of the princes and was well-regarded by Aurangzeb even though she shared the religious outlook of Dara.<ref name="Chandra2005p271" />

Having made clear that he wanted Dara to succeed him, Shah Jahan became ill with [[stranguary]] in 1657 and was closeted under the care of his favourite son in the newly built city of [[Shahjahanabad]] (Old Delhi). Rumours of the death of Shah Jahan abounded and the younger sons were concerned that Dara might be hiding it for [[Machiavellian]] reasons. Thus, they took action: [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] prepared to contest the throne from [[Bengal]], where he had been governor since 1637, while Murad did the same in his governorship of Gujarat and Aurangzeb did so in the Deccan. It is not known whether these preparations were made in the mistaken belief that the rumours of death were true or whether the challengers were just taking advantage of the situation.<ref name="Chandra2005p267">{{cite book |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals |volume=2 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |year=2005 |isbn=9788124110669 |first=Satish |last=Chandra |authorlink=Satish Chandra |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC&pg=PA267 |pages=267–269 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Estampes par Nicolas de Larmessin.f153.Aurangzeb, grand moghol.jpg|thumb|Aurangzeb becomes emperor.]]

After regaining some of his health, Shah Jahan moved to Agra and Dara urged him to send forces to challenge Shah Shuja and Murad, who had declared themselves rulers in their respective territories. While Shah Shuja was defeated at [[Banares]] in February 1658, the army sent to deal with Murad discovered to their surprise that he and Aurangzeb had combined their forces,<ref name="Chandra2005p271" /> the two brothers having agreed to partition the empire once they had gained control of it.<ref name="Chandra2005p272" /> The two armies clashed at [[Dharmat]] in April 1658, with Aurangzeb being the victor. Shuja was being chased through [[Bihar]] and the victory of Aurangzeb proved this to be a poor decision by Dara Shikoh, who now had a defeated force on one front and a successful force unnecessarily pre-occupied on another. Realising that his recalled Bihar forces would not arrive at Agra in time to resist the emboldened Aurangzeb's advance, Dara scrambled to form alliances in order but found that Aurangzeb had already courted key potential candidates. When Dara's disparate, hastily concocted army clashed with Aurangzeb's well-disciplined, battle-hardened force at the [[Battle of Samugarh]] in late May, neither Dara's men nor his generalship were any match for Aurangzeb. Dara had also become over-confident in his own abilities and, by ignoring advice not to lead in battle while his father was alive, he cemented the idea that he had usurped the throne.<ref name="Chandra2005p271">{{cite book |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals |volume=2 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |year=2005 |isbn=9788124110669 |first=Satish |last=Chandra |authorlink=Satish Chandra |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC&pg=PA270 |pages=270–271 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref> Within days, on 8 June 1658, Aurangzeb took control of the nearby capital of Agra and placed his father under arrest.

Aurangzeb then broke his arrangement with Murad Baksh, which probably had been his intention all along.<ref name="Chandra2005p272" /> Instead of looking to partition the empire between himself and Murad, he had his brother arrested and imprisoned at Gwalior Fort. Murad was executed on 4 December 1661, ostensibly for the murder of the ''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'' of Gujarat some time earlier. The allegation was encouraged by Aurangzeb, who caused the ''diwan's'' son to seek retribution for the death under the principles of [[Sharia law]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA162 |pages=162 |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, Dara gathered his forces, and moved to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east, its generals [[Jai Singh I|Jai Singh]] and Dilir Khan, submitted to Aurangzeb, but Dara's son, Suleiman Shikoh, escaped. Aurangzeb offered Shah Shuja the governorship of Bengal. This move had the effect of isolating Dara Shikoh and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja, who had declared himself emperor in Bengal began to annex more territory and this prompted Aurangzeb to march from Punjab with a new and large army that fought during the [[Battle of Khajwa]], where Shah Shuja and his [[chain mail|chain-mail]] armored war elephants were routed by the forces loyal to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja then fled to [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] (in present-day [[Burma]]), where he was executed by the local rulers.<ref>The Cambridge History of India (1922), vol. IV, p. 481.</ref>

With Shuja and Murad disposed of, and with his father Shah Jahan immured in Agra, Aurangzeb pursued Dara Shikoh, chasing him across the north-western bounds of the empire. Aurangzeb claimed that Dara was no longer a Muslim and accused him of poisoning the Mughal [[Grand Vizier]] Saadullah Khan. Both of these statements however lacked any evidence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} After a series of battles, defeats and retreats, Dara was betrayed by one of his generals, who arrested and bound him. In 1658, Aurangzeb arranged his formal coronation in Delhi. He had Dara Shikoh openly marched in chains back to Delhi where he had him executed on arrival on the 30 August 1659.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Having secured his position, Aurangzeb confined his frail father, Shah Jahan, at the Agra Fort but did not mistreat him. Shah Jahan was cared for by Jahanara and died in 1666.<ref name="Chandra2005p272">{{cite book |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals |volume=2 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |year=2005 |isbn=9788124110669 |first=Satish |last=Chandra |authorlink=Satish Chandra |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC&pg=PA270 |page=272 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Great Mosque of Aurungzebe and Adjoining Ghats.jpg|thumb|150px|Great Mosque of Aurungzeb and the adjoining Ghats.]]

Unlike his father, Aurangzeb was not much interested in architecture. The largest structure that he had to his credit is the [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]] in Aurangabad, which he commissioned in 1660 in the memory of his first wife, [[Dilras Banu Begum]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Mughal world: India's tainted paradise|last=Eraly|first= Abraham |year= 2008| publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]|pages=376}}</ref>
Aurangzeb also ordered the construction of the [[Badshahi Mosque]] in [[Lahore]], which for 313 years was the world's largest mosque. Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the [[Moti Masjid (Delhi)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) in the [[Red Fort]] complex in Delhi. He also constructed a mosque on [[Benares]]. The mosque he constructed in Srinagar is still the largest in [[Kashmir]].

===Establishment of Islamic law===
Historian Katherine Brown has noted that "The very name of Aurangzeb seems to act in the popular imagination as a signifier of politico-religious bigotry and repression, regardless of historical accuracy." The subject is controversial and, despite no proof, has resonated in modern times with popularly accepted claims that he intended to destroy the [[Bamiyan Buddhas]] centuries before the [[Taliban]] did so.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Katherine Butler |last=Brown |date=January 2007 |title=Did Aurangzeb Ban Music?

Another instance of Aurangzeb's notoriety was his policy of temple destruction, for which figures vary wildly from 80 to 60,000.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Richard M. |last=Eaton |url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1726/17260700.pdf |title=Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States |year=2000 |page=297}}</ref> Indian historian [[Harbans Mukhia]] wrote that "In the end, as recently recorded in Richard Eaton's careful tabulation, some 80 temples were demolished between 1192 and 1760 (15 in Aurangzeb's reign) and he compares this figure with the claim of 60,000 demolitions, advanced rather nonchalantly by 'Hindu nationalist' propagandists,' although even in that camp professional historians are slightly more moderate."<ref name="Mukhiapp25-26">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dFDV5IJSbWEC |title=The Mughals of India |first=Harbans |last=Mukhia |pages=25–26}}</ref> Among the Hindu temples he demolished were the three most sacred: the [[Kashi Vishwanath temple]], [[Kesava Deo temple]] and [[Somnath temple]].

[[Francois Bernier]], who traveled and chronicled Mughal India during the War of Succession, notes the distaste of both Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb for Christians. This led to the demolition of Christian settlements near the European factories and enslavement of Christian converts by Shah Jahan. Furthermore, Aurangzeb stopped all the aid to Christian missionaries (Frankish Padres) that had been initiated by Akbar and Jahangir.<ref>{{cite book |first=Francois |last=Bernier |authorlink=Francois Bernier |title=Travels Through the Mogul Empire |isbn=978-1-931641-22-7}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Ram Puniyani]] states that Aurangzeb was not always fanatically anti-Hindu, and kept changing his policies depending on the needs of the situation. He banned the construction of new temples, but permitted the repair and maintenance of existing temples. He also made generous donations of ''[[jagir]]''s to several temples to win the sympathies of his Hindu subjects. There are several ''firman''s (orders) in his name, supporting temples and [[gurudwara]]s, including [[Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga|Mahakaleshwar temple]] of Ujjain, Balaji temple of [[Chitrakoot]], [[Umananda Temple]] (Guwahiat) and the [[Shatrunjaya]] Jain temples.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Fn7GhTpJ4esC&lpg=PA60&ots=n_1c4gWmr8&dq=Balaji%20temple%20aurangzeb&pg=PA60#v=onepage&q=firmans&f=false Communal politics: facts versus myths] by Ram Puniyani, Page 60</ref>

===Expansion of the Mughal Empire===
Throughout his reign, Aurangzeb engaged in almost constant warfare. He built up a massive army and began a program of military expansion along all the boundaries of his empire. He pushed north-west into the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and also drove south, conquering two further Muslim kingdoms{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} - the Adil Shahis of Bijapur and Qutbshahis of Golconda&nbsp;— to add to the defeat of the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]] that had been accomplished in 1636 while he had been viceroy of the Deccan. These new territories were administered by the Mughal [[Nawab]]s loyal to Aurangzeb.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[File:Darbarscene.jpg|thumb|Aurangzeb seated on a golden throne holding a [[Hawk]] in the [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]. Standing before him is his son, [[Azam Shah]].]]

Soon after seizing the throne, Aurangzeb began advancements against the unruly [[Sultan]] of Bijapur and during 1657, the Mughals are known to have utilized [[rocket]]s during the [[Siege of Bidar]], against [[Sidi Marjan]].<ref name="Prasad1974">{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yAJuAAAAMAAJ |title=The Mughal Empire |first=Ishwari |last=Prasad |publisher=Chugh Publications |year=1974 |accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2012}} Aurangzeb's forces discharged rockets and grenades while scaling the walls, and Sidi Marjan himself was mortally wounded after a rocket struck his large gunpowder depot.  After twenty-seven days of hard fighting, [[Bidar]] was captured by the Mughals.<ref name="Prasad1974" />

In 1663, during his visit to [[Ladakh]], Aurangzeb established direct control over that part of the empire and loyal subjects such as Deldan Namgyal agreed to pledge tribute and loyalty.  Deldan Namgyal is also known to have constructed a Grand Mosque in [[Leh]], which he dedicated to Mughal rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mg8My6WaWRcC&pg=PA63 |title=Rediscovery of Ladakh |first=H.

In 1664, [[Shaista Khan]] (the son of [[Abul-Hasan ibn Mirza Ghiyas Beg|Asaf Khan IV]]), was appointed the [[Subedar]] of Bengal.  He immediately eliminated [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Arakanese people|Arakanese]] pirates from the region, and in 1666 led an army of 70,000 men to recapture the port of [[Chittagong]] from the Arakanese king [[Sanda Thudhamma]].  Chittagong remained a key port throughout Mughal rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |chapter=Mogul Splendour: The successors of Akbar (1605 - 1707) |first=Jacques |last=Weber |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480-1950 |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2004 |origyear=1994 (Librarie Arthême Fayard, as ''L'Histoire de L'Inde Modern'')|isbn=9781843310044 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}

In 1685, Aurangzeb dispatched his son, [[Muhammad Azam Shah]], with a force of nearly 50,000 men to capture [[Bijapur Fort]] and defeat [[Sikandar Adil Shah]] (the ruler of Bijapur) who refused to be a vassal. The Mughals could not make any advancements upon Bijapur Fort mainly due to the superior usage of cannon batteries on both sides. Outraged by the stalemate Aurangzeb himself arrived on 4 September 1686 and commanded the [[Siege of Bijapur]]; after eight days of fighting, the Mughals were victorious.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Only one remaining ruler, [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah]] (the Qutbshahi ruler of Golconda), refused to surrender. He and his servicemen fortified themselves at Golconda and fiercely protected the [[Kollur Mine]], which was then probably the world's most productive diamond mine, and an important economc asset. In 1687, Aurangzeb led his grand Mughal army against the Deccan Qutbshahi fortress during the [[Siege of Golconda]]. The Qutbshahis had constructed massive fortifications throughout successive generations on a [[granite]] hill over 400&nbsp;ft high with an enormous eight mile long wall enclosing the city. The main gates of Golconda had the ability to repulse any war elephant attack. Although the Qutbshahis maintained the impregnability of their walls, at night Aurangzeb and his infantry erected complex [[scaffold]]ing that allowed them to scale the high walls. During the eight-month siege the Mughals faced many hardships including the death of their experienced commander [[Kilich Khan II|Kilich Khan Bahadur]]. Eventually, Aurangzeb and his forces managed to penetrate the walls by capturing a gate; their entry into the fort led Abul Hasan Qutb Shah to surrender peacefully and hand over his considerable treasure.

Mughal cannon production reached its zenith during the reign of Aurangzeb.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Until the later part of the seventeenth century, such manufacture in India was principally the work of Europeans, with indigenous workers gradually assimilating their skills.<ref>{{cite book |title=Modern World System and Indian Proto-industrialization: Bengal 1650-1800 |volume=1 |first=Abhay Kumar |last=Singh |isbn=9788172112035 |pages=351–352 |publisher=Northern Book Centre |location=New Delhi |year=2006 |isbn=9788172112011 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WwNUblS-jpwC&pg=PA351 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> One of the most impressive Mughal cannons is known as the [[Zafarbaksh]], which is a very rare ''composite cannon'', that required skills in both wrought-iron forge welding and [[bronze]]-casting technologies and the in-depth knowledge of the qualities of both metals.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sLfaAAAAMAAJ |title=Unknown |journal=Indian Journal of History of Science |volume=42 |publisher=National Institute of Sciences of India |year=2007 |accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}} The ''Ibrahim Rauza'' was also a famed cannon, which was well known for its multi-barrels.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lDRbAAAAQAAJ |title=Bombay and western India: a series of stray papers |volume=2 |first=James |last=Douglas |publisher=Sampson Low, Marston & Company |year=1893 |accessdate=}}</ref> François Bernier, the personal physician to Aurangzeb, observed versatile Mughal gun-carriages each drawn by two horses.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7n6Cg9znFrUC&pg=PA59 |title=Gunpowder, Explosives And the State: A Technological History |first=Brenda J. |last=Buchanan |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2006 |page=59 |isbn=9780754652595 |accessdate=}}</ref>

Despite these innovations, most soldiers used bows and arrows, the quality of sword manufacture was so poor that they preferred to use ones imported from England, and the operation of the cannons was entrusted not to Mughals but to European gunners. Other weapons used during the period included rockets, cauldrons of boiling oil, muskets and [[manjaniq]]s (stone-throwing catapults).<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder |first=James Riddick |last=Partington |authorlink=James Riddick Partington |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1998 |origyear=1960 (Cambridge: W.

As soon as he became emperor, Aurangzeb sent some of the finest ornate gifts such as carpets, lamps, [[tile]]s and others to the Islamic shrines at [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. He also ordered the construction of very large ships in [[Surat]] that would transport these gifts and even pilgrims to the [[Hijaz]].

In 1686, the English East India Company, which had unsuccessfully tried to obtain a [[firman]], an imperial directive that would grant England regular trading privileges throughout the Mughal empire, initiated the so-called [[Child's War]].

In September 1695, English pirate [[Henry Every]] perpetrated one of the most profitable pirate raids in history with his capture of a Grand Mughal convoy near [[Surat]].

In 1657, while Aurangzeb attacked Golconda and Bijapur in the Deccan, the Hindu Maratha warrior, Shivaji, used guerrilla tactics to take control of three Adil Shahi forts formerly under his father's command. With these victories, Shivaji assumed de facto leadership of many independent Maratha clans. The Marathas harried the flanks of the warring Adil Shahis and Mughals, gaining weapons, forts, and territory.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |pages=72–78}}</ref> Shivaji's small and ill-equipped army survived an all out Adil Shahi attack, and Shivaji personally killed the Adil Shahi general, Afzal Khan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |pages=121–125}}</ref> With this event, the Marathas transformed into a powerful military force, capturing more and more Adil Shahi and Mughal territories.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |pages=130–138}}</ref> Shivaji went on to neutralise Mughal power in the region.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C |chapter=Mogul Splendour: The successors of Akbar (1605 - 1707) |first=Jacques |last=Weber |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480-1950 |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2004 |origyear=1994 (Librarie Arthême Fayard, as ''L'Histoire de L'Inde Modern'')|isbn=9781843310044 |page=102|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>

In 1659, Aurangzeb sent his trusted general and maternal uncle Shaista Khan, the [[Wali]] in Golconda to recover forts lost to the Maratha rebels. Shaista Khan drove into Maratha territory and took up residence in Pune. But in a daring raid on the governor's palace in Pune during a midnight wedding celebration, the Marathas killed Shaista Khan's son and maimed Shaista Khan by cutting off the fingers of his hand. Shaista Khan, however, survived and was re-appointed the administrator of Bengal going on to become a key commander in the war against the Ahoms. It is believed that Shivaji presented the head of Afzal Khan and the fingers of Shaista Khan to his mother [[Jijabai]], symbolizing his swift victory over Aurangzeb.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

However, Aurangzeb ignored the rise of the Marathas for the next few years as he was occupied with other religious and political matters including the rise of Sikhism. Shivaji captured forts belonging to both Mughals and Bijapur. At last Aurangzeb ordered the armament of the [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad Fort]] with two [[Bombard (weapon)|bombards]] (the Daulatabad Fort was later utilized as a Mughal bastion during the Deccan Wars). Aurangzeb also sent his general [[Jai Singh I|Raja Jai Singh]] of [[Amber, India|Amber]], a Hindu Rajput, to attack the Marathas. Jai Singh won the fort of Purandar after fierce battle in which the Maratha commander Murarbaji fell. Foreseeing defeat, Shivaji agreed for a truce and a meeting with Aurangjeb at Delhi. Jai Singh also promised Shivaji his safety, placing him under the care of his own son, the future Raja [[Ram Singh I]]. However, circumstances at the Mughal court were beyond the control of the Raja, and when Shivaji and his son Sambhaji went to Agra to meet Aurangzeb, they were placed under house arrest, from which they managed to effect a daring escape.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |page=197}}</ref>

Shivaji returned to the Deccan, and was given the title ''Chhatrapati'' of the Maratha Empire in 1674.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Dennis |year=1937 |title=The Grand Rebel: An Impression of Shivaji, Founder of the Maratha Empire |location=London |publisher=Collins |page=283}}</ref> While Aurangzeb continued to send troops against him, Shivaji expanded Maratha control throughout the Deccan until his death in 1680. Shivaji was succeeded by his son, Sambhaji. Militarily and politically, Mughal efforts to control the Deccan continued to fail.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

When Maharaja Jaswant Singh of [[Jodhpur]] died in 1679, a conflict ensued over who would be the next Raja. Aurangzeb's choice of a nephew of the former Maharaja was not accepted by other members of Jaswant Singh's family and they rebelled, albeit in vain. Thereat, Aurangzeb seized control of Jodhpur. He also moved on [[Udaipur]], which was the only other state of [[Rajputana]] to support the rebellion. There was never a clear resolution to this conflict, although it is noted that the other Rajputs, including the [[Kachhwaha]] Rajput clan of Raja Jai Singh, the [[Bhatti]]s, and the [[Rathore]]s, remained loyal. On the other hand, Aurangzeb's third son [[Sultan Muhammad Akbar|Akbar]] left the Mughal court along with a few Muslim Mansabdar supporters and joined Muslim rebels in the Deccan. Aurangzeb in response moved his court to Aurangabad and took over command of the Deccan campaign. The rebels were defeated and Akbar fled south to the shelter of Sambhaji, Shivaji's successor. More battles ensued, and Akbar fled to [[Persia]] and never returned.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Great Moghuls |first1=Bamber |last1=Gascoigne |first2=Christina |last2=Gascoigne |authorlink1=Bamber Gascoigne |publisher=Cape |year=1971 |pages=228–229 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-ryFAAAAIAAJ}}</ref>

In 1689, Aurangzeb's forces captured Sambhaji, his successor [[Rajaram Chhatrapati]] and his Maratha forces fought individual battles against the forces of the Mughal Empire, and territory changed hands repeatedly during years of interminable warfare. As there was no central authority among the Marathas, Aurangzeb was forced to contest every inch of territory, at great cost in lives and money. Even as Aurangzeb drove west, deep into Maratha territory&nbsp;– notably conquering [[Satara]]&nbsp;— the Marathas expanded their attacks further into Mughal lands&nbsp;– [[Malwa]], [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] and [[Gingee|Jinji]] in Tamil Nadu. Aurangzeb waged continuous war in the Deccan for more than two decades with no resolution.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Great Moghuls |first1=Bamber |last1=Gascoigne |first2=Christina |last2=Gascoigne |authorlink1=Bamber Gascoigne |publisher=Cape |year=1971 |pages=239–246 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-ryFAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> He thus lost about a fifth of his army fighting rebellions led by the Marathas in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan India]]. He came down thousands of miles to the Deccan to conquer the [[Maratha Empire]] and eventually died at the age of 90, during his final campaign against the Maratha Empire.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The Mughals suffered heavy losses in the entire [[war of 27 years]]. Afterwards, the whole Mughal Empire was split in small kingdoms. The [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], [[Nawab of Oudh]] and [[Nawab of Bengal]] quickly declared their kingdoms as independent from Mughals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Ahom campaign===
[[File:Aurangzeb in old age 2.jpg|thumb|Aurangzeb reading the [[Quran]].]]
While Aurangzeb and his brother Shah Shuja had been fighting against each other, the Hindu rulers of [[Kuch Behar]] and [[Assam]], took advantage of the disturbed conditions in the Mughal Empire, had invaded imperial dominions. For three years they were not attacked, but in 1660 [[Mir Jumla II]], the viceroy of Bengal, was ordered to recover the lost territories.<ref name="Jadunath Sarkar 1948">{{cite book |first1=R. C. |last1=Majumdar |first2=Jadunath |last2=Sarkar |title=History of Bengal |location=Dacca |year=1943–1948 |volume=II |page=364}}</ref>

The Mughals set out in November, 1661, and within weeks occupied the capital of [[Kuch Behar]] after a few fierce skirmishes. The Kuch Behar was annexed, and the [[Mughal Army]] reorganized and began to retake their territories in Assam. Mir Jumla II's forces captured Pandu, [[Guwahati]], and Kajali practically unopposed. In February 1662, Mir Jumla II initiated the [[Siege of Simalugarh]] and after the Mughal [[cannon]] breached the fortifications, the Ahoms abandoned the fort and escaped. Mir Jumla II then proceeded towards Garhgaon the capital of the [[Ahom kingdom]], which was reached on March 17, 1662, although the ruler [[Raja]] [[Sutamla]] fled and the victorious Mughals captured 100 elephants, about 300,000 coins of gold and silver, 8000 shields, 1000 ships, and 173 massive stores of rice.<ref name="Jadunath Sarkar 1948"/>

When the Mughal navy from Lakhau and Dacca led by [[Munnawar Khan]] armed with [[gunboat]]s began to take control of the [[Brahmaputra River]], the Ahoms concluded a treaty at Ghilajharighat in January 1663 and ceded western Assam to the Mughals, promised a war indemnity of 300,000 gold and silver coins and 100 elephants. In addition to that Sutamla had to deliver his only child and daughter Ramani Gabharu, as well as his niece, the daughter of the Tipam Raja to the [[harem]] in Agra. Thus, according to the treaty Sutamla returned the territories in Kamrup to the possession of the Mughals and promised to pay a heavy war indemnity. After the Mughals received a heavy tribute they further captured some forts and towns in the cultivated districts near the frontier of Bengal and Assam.<ref name="Faruki1935p117">{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vvNtAAAAMAAJ |title=Aurangzeb and His times |first=Zahiruddin |last=Faruki |page=117 |publisher=Idarah-i Adabiyāt-i Delli |year=1935 |location=Bombay |edition=Reprinted |accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>

Later that year in December 1663, the aged Mir Jumla II died on his way back to [[Dacca]] of natural causes, but skirmishes continued between the Mughals and Ahoms after the rise of [[Chakradhwaj Singha]], who refused to pay further indemnity to the Mughals and during the wars that continued the Mughals suffered great hardships. Munnawar Khan emerged as a leading figure and is known to have supplied food to vulnerable Mughal forces in the region near Mathurapur. Although the Mughals under the command of Syed Firoz Khan the [[Faujdar]] at [[Guwahati]] were overrun by two Ahom armies in the year 1667, but they continued to hold and maintain presence along their the eastern territories even after the [[Battle of Saraighat]] in the year 1671.<ref>{{cite book |first1=R.

===Sikhs===
[[File:The Emperor Aurangzeb on Horseback ca. 1690–1710 The Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb on horseback.]]

Early in Aurangzeb's reign, various insurgent groups of Sikhs engaged Mughal troops in increasingly bloody battles. The ninth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]], like his predecessors was opposed to conversion of the local population as he considered it wrong. Approached by [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s to help them retain their faith and avoid [[forced conversion|forced religious conversions]], Bahadur took on Aurangzeb. The emperor perceived the rising popularity of the guru as a threat to his sovereignty and in 1670 had him executed,<ref>{{cite book |title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes |first=Narender |last=Sehgal |location=Delhi |publisher=Utpal Publications |year=1994 |url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter14.html |isbn=9788185217062}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2012}} which infuriated the Sikhs. In response, Bahadur's son and successor, [[Guru Gobind Singh]], further militarized his followers, starting with the establishment of [[Khalsa]] in 1699, eight years before Aurangzeb's death.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===The Pashtun rebellion===
The Pashtun revolt in 1672 under the leadership of the warrior poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] was triggered when soldiers under the orders of the Mughal Governor Amir Khan allegedly attempted to molest women of the [[Safi tribe]] in modern day [[Kunar Province|Kunar]]. The Safi tribes retaliated against the soldiers. This attack provoked a reprisal, which triggered a general revolt of most of tribes. Attempting to reassert his authority, Amir Khan led a large Mughal Army to the [[Khyber Pass]], where the army was surrounded by tribesmen and routed, with only four men, including the Governor, managing to escape.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

After that the revolt spread, with the Mughals suffering a near total collapse of their authority in the Pashtun belt. The closure of the important [[Attock]]-[[Kabul]] trade route along the [[Grand Trunk road]] was particularly disastrous. By 1674, the situation had deteriorated to a point where Aurangzeb camped at Attock to personally take charge. Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebels and partially suppressed the revolt, although they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route. The anarchy that became endemic on the Empire's North-Western frontier as a consequence ensured that [[Nadir Shah]]'s invading forces, half a century later, faced little resistance on the road to Delhi.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Aurangzeb's vast imperial campaigns against rebellion-affected areas of the Mughal Empire, caused his opponents to exaggerate the "importance" of their rebellions. The results of his campaigns were made worse by the incompetence of his regional Nawabs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Muslim views regarding Aurangzeb vary. Most Muslim historians believe that Aurangzeb was the last powerful ruler of an empire inevitably on the verge of decline. The major rebellions organized by the Sikhs and the Marathas had deep roots in the remote regions of the Mughal Empire.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury to be held in trust for the citizens of his empire. He made caps and copied the Quran to earn money for his use. He did not use the royal treasury for personal expenses or extravagant building projects excepting perhaps the [[Badshahi Mosque]] in [[Lahore]], which for 313 years was the world's largest mosque.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the [[Moti Masjid (Delhi)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) in the [[Red Fort]] complex in Delhi. However, his constant warfare, especially with the Marathas, drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy just as much as the wasteful personal spending and opulence of his predecessors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Aurangzeb knew he would not return to the throne after his final campaign against the Maratha in 1706, in which, he was joined by newly emerging commanders in the Mughal army such as [[Sayyid Brothers|Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha]], [[Saadat Ali Khan I|Saadat Ali Khan]] and [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I|Asaf Jah I]] and Daud Khan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

{{quote|the conquest of the Deccan, to which, Aurangzeb devoted the last 26 years of his life, was in many ways a Pyrrhic victory, costing an estimated hundred thousand lives a year during its last decade of futile chess game warfare. The expense in gold and rupees can hardly be accurately estimated. Aurangzeb's encampment was like a moving capital&nbsp;– a city of tents 30 miles in circumference, with some 250 bazaars, with a {{frac|1|2}} million camp followers, 50,000 camels and 30,000 elephants, all of whom had to be fed, stripped the Deccan of any and all of its surplus grain and wealth&nbsp;...

Even when ill and dying, Aurangzeb made sure that the populace knew he was still alive, for if they had thought otherwise then the turmoil of another war of succession was likely.<ref>{{cite book |title=Civilization and Capitalism: 15th-18th Century: The Perspective of the World |volume=III |first=Fernand |last=Braudel |authorlink=Fernand Braudel |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley & Los Angeles |year=1992 |origyear=1979 (Paris: Librairie Armand Colin: ''Le Temps du Monde'') |isbn=9780520081161 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xMZI2QEer9QC&pg=PA514 |page=514 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> He died in Ahmednagar on 20 February 1707 at the age of 88, having outlived many of his children.

Brown describes that after his death, "a string of weak emperors, wars of succession, and coups by noblemen heralded the irrevocable weakening of Mughal power". She notes that the populist but "fairly old-fashioned" explanation for the decline is that there was a reaction to Aurangzeb's oppression.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Katherine Butler |last=Brown |date=January 2007 |title=Did Aurangzeb Ban Music?
