{{Campaignbox First Persian invasion of Greece}}
The '''Battle of Marathon''' ({{lang-el|Μάχη τοῦ Μαραθῶνος}}, ''Machē tu Marathōnos'') took place in 490 BC, during the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]]. It was fought between the citizens of [[History of Athens|Athens]], aided by [[Plataea]], and a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] force commanded by [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]]. The battle was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia, under King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], to subjugate [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians, marking a turning point in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. 

The first Persian invasion was a response to Greek involvement in the [[Ionian Revolt]], when Athens and [[Eretria]] had sent a force to support the cities of [[Ionia]] in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning [[Sardis]], but were then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, Darius swore to burn down Athens and Eretria. At the time of the battle, Sparta and Athens were the two largest city states. Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the [[Battle of Lade]] in 494 BC, Darius began plans to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], to subjugate the [[Cyclades]], and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching [[Euboea]] in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria. The Persian force then sailed for Attica, landing in the bay near the town of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]]. The Athenians, joined by a small force from [[Plataea]], marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. 

The Greeks could not hope to face the superior Persian cavalry; however, when learning that the Persian cavalry was temporarily absent from the camp, Miltiades ordered a general attack against the Persians. He reinforced his flanks, luring the Persians' best fighters into his centre. The inward wheeling flanks enveloped the Persians, routing them. The Persian army broke in panic towards their ships, and large numbers were slaughtered. The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece, and the Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son [[Xerxes I]] restarted the preparations for a [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second invasion of Greece]], which finally began in 480 BC.

The Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can be seen to begin at Marathon. Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society, the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in European history. The battle is perhaps now more famous as the inspiration for the [[marathon]] race. Although thought to be historically inaccurate, the legend of the Greek messenger [[Pheidippides]] running to Athens with news of the victory became the inspiration for this athletic event, introduced at the 1896 Athens Olympics, and originally run between Marathon and Athens.

== Sources ==
{{Main|Herodotus}}

The main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',<ref>Cicero, On the Laws I, 5</ref> was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—''Historia''; English—''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ended in 450 BC).<ref name = hxvi/> Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.<ref name = hxvi/> As Holland has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally."<ref name = hxvi>Holland, pp. ''xvi''–''xvii''.</ref>

Many changes that were subsequent with ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].<ref>Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&layout=&loc=1.22 I, 22]</ref><ref name = Fin15>Finley, p. 15.</ref> Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and may therefore have felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.<ref name = Fin15/> [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay "On The Malignity of Herodotus", describing Herodotus as "''Philobarbaros''" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.<ref>Holland, p. ''xxiv''.</ref> A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm#1|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.<ref name = h377>Holland, p. 377.</ref> The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.<ref name = h377/> Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.<ref>Fehling, pp. 1–277.</ref>

The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&layout=&loc=11.28 Bibliotheca Historica]</ref> The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]], also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.<ref>Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=9.81.1 IX, 81]</ref>

The first Persian invasion of Greece had its immediate roots in the [[Ionian Revolt]], the earliest phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the Greeks and Persians. In 500 BC the Persian Empire was still relatively young and highly expansionistic, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.<ref name = h47>Holland, pp. 47–55</ref><ref name = h58>Holland, pp. 58–62</ref><ref name="h203"/> Moreover, the Persian king Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.<ref name = h47/> Even before the Ionian Revolt, Darius had begun to expand the Empire into Europe, subjugating [[Thrace]], and forcing Macedon to become allied to Persia. Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of Ancient Greece may have been inevitable.<ref name = h58/> However, the Ionian Revolt had directly threatened the integrity of the Persian empire, and the states of mainland Greece remained a potential menace to its future stability.<ref name = h171>Holland, 171–178</ref> Darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify Greece and the Aegean, and to punish those involved in the Ionian Revolt.<ref name = h171/><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.105 V, 105]</ref>

The Ionian revolt had begun with an unsuccessful [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|expedition]] against [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]], a joint venture between the Persian satrap [[Artaphernes]] and the [[Miletus|Milesian]] tyrant [[Aristagoras]].<ref name = h154>Holland, pp. 154–157</ref> In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy.<ref name = h154/> The other [[Ionia]]n cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and  declaring themselves democracies.<ref name = h154/><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.98 V, 97]</ref> Artistagoras then appealed to the states of mainland Greece for support, but only [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] offered to send troops.<ref name = h157>Holland, pp. 157–161</ref>

The involvement of Athens in the Ionian Revolt arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the [[Athenian Democracy]] in the late 6th century BC.<ref name = h157/>

In 510 BC, with the aid of [[Cleomenes I]], King of [[Sparta]], the Athenian people had expelled [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], the [[tyrant]] ruler of Athens.<ref name = V65>Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.65 V, 65]</ref> With Hippias's father [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]], the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue Hippias's rule.<ref name = V65/> Hippias fled to [[Sardis]] to the court of the Persian [[satrap]], [[Artaphernes]] and promised control of Athens to the Persians if they were to help restore him.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.97 V, 96]</ref> In the meantime, Cleomenes helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under [[Isagoras]] in Athens, in opposition to [[Cleisthenes]], the leader of the traditionally powerful [[Alcmaeonidae]] family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of Athens.<ref name = h131>Holland, pp. 131–132</ref> Cleisthenes, however, found himself being politically defeated by a coalition led by Isagoras and decided to change the rules of the game by appealing to the demos (the people), in effect making them a new faction in the political arena.  This tactic succeeded, but the Spartan King, Cleomenes I, returned at the request of Isagoras and so the Cleisthenes, the Alcmaeonids and other prominent Athenian families were exiled from Athens.  When Isagoras attempted to create a narrow oligarchic government, the Athenian people, in a spontaneous and unprecedented move, expelled Cleomenes and Isagoras.<ref name = "h133">Holland, pp. 133–136</ref> Cleisthenes was thus restored to Athens (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to reform the state with the aim of securing his position.  The result was not actually a democracy or a real civic state, but he enabled the development of a fully democratic government, which would emerge in the next generation as the demos realized its power.<ref>For a full account and analysis see R.M. Berthold, Dare To Struggle. The History and Society of Greece (2009) pp. 81–94</ref>  The new-found freedom and self-governance of the Athenians meant that they were thereafter exceptionally hostile to the return of the tyranny of Hippias, or any form of outside subjugation; by Sparta, Persia or anyone else.<ref name = "h133"/>

[[File:Darius-Vase.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Darius I of Persia, as imagined by a Greek painter, 4th century BC]]

Cleomenes was not pleased with the events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army.<ref name = h136>Holland, pp. 136–138</ref> Cleomenes's attempts to restore Isagoras to Athens ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian Empire.<ref name = h142>Holland, p. 142</ref> Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him an 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced to.<ref name = h142/> However, they were severely censured for this when they returned to Athens.<ref name = h142/> At some point later Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias to the rule of Athens. This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate Athens.<ref name = V96>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23872;layout=;loc=5.95.1 V, 96]</ref> The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant.<ref name = "h157"/> Needless to say, the Athenians balked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia.<ref name = V96/> Having thus become the enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt.<ref name = "h157"/> The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of Athens no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt; especially since the cities of Ionia were originally Athenian colonies.<ref name = "h157"/>

The Athenians and Eretrians sent a task force of 25 triremes to Asia Minor to aid the revolt.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23875;layout=;loc=5.98.1 V, 99]</ref> Whilst there, the Greek army surprised and outmaneuvered Artaphernes, marching to Sardis and burning the lower city.<ref name = "h160">Holland, p. 160</ref> However, this was as much as the Greeks achieved, and they were then pursued back to the coast by Persian horsemen, losing many men in the process. Despite the fact that their actions were ultimately fruitless, the Eretrians and in particular the Athenians had earned Darius's lasting enmity, and he vowed to punish both cities.<ref name = "h168">Holland, p. 168</ref> The Persian naval victory at the [[Battle of Lade]] (494 BC) all but ended the Ionian Revolt, and by 493 BC, the last hold-outs were vanquished by the Persian fleet.<ref>Holland, p. 176</ref> The revolt was used as an opportunity by Darius to extend the empire's border to the islands of the eastern Aegean<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23933;layout=;loc=6.32.1 VI, 31]</ref>  and the [[Propontis]], which had not been part of the Persian dominions before.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23935;layout=;loc=6.32.1 VI, 33]</ref> The completion of the pacification of Ionia allowed the Persians to begin planning their next moves; to extinguish the threat to the empire from Greece, and to punish Athens and Eretria.<ref>Holland, pp. 177–178</ref>

In 492 BC, once the Ionian Revolt had finally been crushed, Darius dispatched an [[First Persian invasion of Greece#492 BC: Mardonius's Campaign|expedition]] to Greece under the command of his son-in-law, [[Mardonius]]. Mardonius re-conquered [[Thrace]] and compelled [[Alexander I of Macedon]] to make [[Macedon]] a client kingdom to Persia, before the wrecking of his fleet brought a premature end to the campaign.<ref name = VI44>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23946;layout=;loc=6.43.1 VI, 44]</ref>
However in 490 BC, following up the successes of the previous campaign, Darius decided to send a maritime expedition led by [[Artaphernes]], (son of the satrap to whom Hippias had fled) and [[Datis]], a [[Medes|Median]] admiral. Mardonius had been injured in the prior campaign and had fallen out of favor. The [[First Persian invasion of Greece#490 BC: Datis and Artaphernes' Campaign|expedition]] was intended to bring the [[Cyclades]] into the Persian empire, to punish [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]] (which had resisted a Persian assault in 499 BC) and then to head to Greece to force Eretria and Athens to submit to Darius or be destroyed.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.94.1 VI, 94 ]</ref> After island-hopping across the Aegean, including successfully attacking Naxos, the Persian task force arrived off Euboea in mid summer. The Persians then proceeded to [[Siege of Eretria|besiege]], capture and burn Eretria. They then headed south down the coast of Attica, en route to complete the final objective of the campaign—to punish Athens.

[[Image:BeachedShipsMarathon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A picture reconstructing the beached Persian ships at Marathon before the battle.]]

The Persians sailed down the coast of Attica, and landed at the bay of Marathon, roughly {{convert|25|mi|km}} from Athens, on the advice of the exiled Athenian tyrant Hippias (who had accompanied the expedition).<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.102 VI, 102]</ref> Under the guidance of [[Miltiades]], the Athenian general with the greatest experience of fighting the Persians, the Athenian army marched quickly to block the two exits from the plain of Marathon, and prevent the Persians moving inland.<ref name = h187/><ref>Cornelius Nepos, Miltiades, IV</ref> At the same time, Athens's greatest runner, [[Pheidippides]] (or Philippides in some accounts) had been sent to Sparta to request that the Spartan army march to the aid of Athens.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231011;layout=;loc=6.106.1 VI, 105]</ref> Pheidippides arrived during the festival of ''[[Carneia]]'', a sacrosanct period of peace, and was informed that the Spartan army could not march to war until the full moon rose; Athens could not expect reinforcement for at least ten days.<ref name = h187>Holland, pp. 187–190</ref> The Athenians would have to hold out at Marathon for the time being, although they were reinforced by the full muster of 1,000 hoplites from the small city of [[Plataea]]; a gesture which did much to steady the nerves of the Athenians,<ref name = h187/> and won unending Athenian gratitude to Plataea.

For approximately five days the armies therefore confronted each other across the plain of Marathon, in stalemate.<ref name = h187/> The flanks of the Athenian camp were protected either by a grove of trees, or an ''abbatis'' of stakes (depending on the exact reading).<ref>Cornelius Nepos, Miltiades, VI</ref><ref name = L56>Lazenby, p. 56</ref> Since every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer, the delay worked in favor of the Athenians.<ref name = h187/> There were ten Athenian ''[[strategos|strategoi]]'' (generals) at Marathon, elected by each of the ten [[phyle|tribes]] that the Athenians were divided into; Miltiades was one of these.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231009;layout=;loc=6.104.1 VI, 103]</ref> In addition, in overall charge, was the War-Archon (polemarch), [[Callimachus (polemarch)|Callimachus]], who had been elected by the whole citizen body.<ref name = VI109>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231009;layout=;loc=6.104.1 VI, 109]</ref> Herodotus suggests that command rotated between the ''strategoi'', each taking in turn a day to command the army.<ref name = VI110>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231016;layout=;loc=6.109.1 VI, 110]</ref> He further suggests that each ''strategos'', on his day in command, instead deferred to Miltiades.<ref name = VI110/> In Herodotus's account, Miltiades is keen to attack the Persians (despite knowing that the Spartans are coming to aid the Athenians), but strangely, chooses to wait until his actual day of command to attack.<ref name = VI110/> This passage is undoubtedly problematic; the Athenians had little to gain by attacking before the Spartans arrived,<ref name = L59/> and there is no real evidence of this rotating generalship.<ref name = L57>Lazenby, pp. 57–59</ref> There does, however, seem to have been a delay between the Athenian arrival at Marathon, and the battle; Herodotus, who evidently believed that Miltiades was eager to attack, may have made a mistake whilst seeking to explain this delay.<ref name = L57/>

As is discussed [[#Strategic and tactical considerations|below]], the reason for the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially.<ref name = L59>Lazenby, pp. 59–62</ref><ref name = "h191">Holland, pp. 191–195</ref> This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), but it is not clear why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans.<ref name = L59/> There are two main theories to explain this.<ref name = L59/>

The first theory is that the Persian cavalry left Marathon for an unspecified reason, and that the Greeks moved to take advantage of this by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of cavalry in Herodotus' account of the battle, and an entry in the [[Suda]] dictionary.<ref name = L59/> The entry ''χωρίς ἰππεῖς'' ("without cavalry") is explained thus: <blockquote>The cavalry left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the Ionians climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the cavalry had left. And when [[Miltiades]] realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before battle.<ref>[[Suda]], entry ''Without cavalry''</ref></blockquote> There are many variations of this theory, but perhaps the most prevalent is that the cavalry was re-embarked on the ships, and was to be sent by sea to attack (undefended) Athens in the rear, whilst the rest of the Persians pinned down the Athenian army at Marathon.<ref name = h187/> This theory therefore utilises Herodotus' suggestion that after Marathon, the Persian army re-embarked and tried to sail around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly;<ref name = VI115>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%231021;loc=6.116.1 VI, 115]</ref> however, according to the first theory this attempt would have occurred ''before'' the battle (and indeed have triggered the battle).<ref name = h191/>

The second theory is simply that the battle occurred because the Persians finally moved to attack the Athenians.<ref name = L59/> Although this theory has the Persians moving to the ''strategic'' offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the ''tactical'' offensive, and attacked them.<ref name = L59/> Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply that there was some kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle.<ref name = L59/>

=== Date of the battle ===
Herodotus mentions for several events a date in the [[lunisolar calendar]], of which each Greek city-state used a variant.  Astronomical computation allows us to derive an absolute date in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]] which is much used by historians as the chronological frame. [[Philipp August Böckh]] in 1855  concluded that the battle took place on September 12, 490 BC in the Julian calendar, and this is the conventionally accepted date.<ref name = date/>  However, this depends on when exactly the Spartans held their festival and it is possible that the Spartan calendar was one month ahead of that of Athens. In that case the battle took place on August 12, 490 BC.<ref name = date>D.W. Olson ''et al.'', pp. 34–41</ref>

Herodotus does not give a figure for the size of the Athenian army.  However, [[Cornelius Nepos]],  [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and [[Plutarch]] all give the figure of 9,000 Athenians and 1,000 Plateans;<ref>Cornelius Nepos, ''Miltiades'', V</ref><ref>Pausanias X, 20</ref><ref name="Plutarch, Moralia, 305 B">Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 305 B</ref> while Justin suggests that there were 10,000 Athenians and 1,000 Plataeans.<ref>Justin II, 9</ref> These numbers are highly comparable to the number of troops Herodotus says that the Athenians and Plataeans sent to the [[Battle of Plataea]] 11 years later.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=9.28 IX, 28]</ref> Pausanias noticed on the monument to the battle the names of former [[slavery|slaves]] who were freed in exchange for military services.<ref name>Pausanias I, 32</ref> Modern historians generally accept these numbers as reasonable.<ref name = h187/><ref>Lazenby, p. 54</ref>

According to Herodotus, the fleet sent by Darius consisted of 600 [[trireme]]s.<ref>Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231001;layout=;loc=6.96.1 VI, 95]</ref> Herodotus does not estimate the size of the Persian army, only saying that they were a "large infantry that was well packed".<ref>Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.94 VI, 94]</ref> Among ancient sources, the poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], another near-contemporary, says the campaign force numbered 200,000; while a later writer, the Roman [[Cornelius Nepos]] estimates 200,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry, of which only 100,000 fought in the battle, while the rest were loaded into the fleet that was rounding Cape Sounion;<ref name = Nepos>Cornelius Nepos, ''Miltiades'', IV</ref> [[Plutarch]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] both independently give 300,000, as does the [[Suda]] dictionary.<ref name="Plutarch, Moralia, 305 B"/><ref>Pausanias IV, 22</ref><ref>Suda, entry ''Hippias''</ref> [[Plato]] and [[Lysias]] give 500,000;<ref>Plato, ''Menexenus'', 240 A</ref><ref>Lysias, ''Funeral Oration'', 21</ref> and [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] 600,000.<ref name = Justin>Justinus II, 9</ref>

Modern historians have proposed wide ranging numbers for the infantry, from 20,000–100,000 with a consensus of perhaps 25,000;<ref>Davis, pp. 9–13</ref><ref>Holland, p. 390</ref><ref>Lloyd, p. 164</ref><ref name=Green>Green, p. 90</ref> estimates for the cavalry are in the range of 1,000.<ref>Lazenby, p. 46</ref>

== Strategic and tactical considerations ==
[[Image:Archers frieze Darius palace Louvre AOD487.jpg|right|thumb|185px|Persian infantry (probably [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]]), shown in a frieze in Darius's palace, Susa]]

From a strategic point of view, the Athenians had some disadvantages at Marathon. In order to face the Persians in battle, the Athenians had had to summon all available hoplites;<ref name = h187/> and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1.<ref name = L56/> Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against.<ref name = h191/> Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered.<ref name = h187/> However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially had no need to seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer.<ref name = h187/><ref name = L59/> Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by not attacking, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle.<ref name = L59/> Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.<ref name = h191/>

The Persian strategy, on the other hand, was probably principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].<ref name = L256>Lazenby, p. 256</ref>) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.<ref name = h191/>

Whatever event eventually triggered the battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians to attack the Persians. If the first theory is correct (see [[#Prelude|above]]), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, and the threat of being outflanked made it imperative to attack.<ref name = h191/> Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them.<ref name = L59/> Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians;<ref>Lazenby, p. 67</ref> the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view.<ref name = L256/> If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements.<ref name = L59/> Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.<ref name = L59/>

== Battle ==
[[File:Battle of Marathon Greek Double Envelopment.png|right|250px|thumb|The Battle of Marathon]]

The distance between the two armies at the point of battle had narrowed to "a distance not less than 8 stadia" or about 1,500 meters.<ref name = VI112>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231018;layout=;loc=6.111.1 VI, 112]</ref> Miltiades ordered the two tribes that were forming the center of the Greek formation, the Leontis tribe led by [[Themistocles]] and the Antiochis tribe led by [[Aristides]], to be arranged in the depth of four ranks while the rest of the tribes at their flanks were in ranks of eight.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aristides'', V</ref><ref name = VI111>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231018;layout=;loc=6.111.1 VI, 111]</ref> Some modern commentators have suggested this was a deliberate ploy to encourage a [[double envelopment]] of the Persian centre. However, this supposes a level of training that the Greeks did not possess.<ref>Lazenby, p. 250</ref> There is little evidence for any such tactical thinking in Greek battles until [[Battle of Leuctra|Leuctra]] in 371 BC.<ref>Lazenby, p. 258</ref> It is therefore probable that this arrangement was made, possibly at the last moment, so that the Athenian line was as long as the Persian line, and would not therefore be outflanked.<ref name = "h191"/><ref>Lazenby, p. 64</ref>

When the Athenian line was ready, according to one source, the simple signal to advance was given  by Miltiades: "At them".<ref name = h191/> Herodotus implies the Athenians ran the whole distance to the Persian lines, shouting their ululating war cry, "Ελελευ! Ελελευ!" ("Eleleu! Eleleu!").<ref name = VI112/> It is doubtful that the Athenians ran the whole distance; in full armour this would be very difficult.<ref name = L66>Lazenby, pp. 66–69</ref> More likely, they marched until they reached the limit of the archers' effectiveness, the "beaten zone" (roughly 200 meters), and then broke into a run towards their enemy.<ref name = L66/> Another possibility is that they ran ''up to'' the 200 meter-mark in broken ranks, and then reformed for the march into battle from there.  Herodotus suggests that this was the first time a Greek army ran into battle in this way; this was probably because it was the first time that a Greek army had faced an enemy composed primarily of missile troops.<ref name = L66/> All this was evidently much to the surprise of the Persians; "... in their minds they charged the Athenians with madness which must be fatal, seeing that they were few and yet were pressing forwards at a run, having neither cavalry nor archers".<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.110 VI, 110]</ref> Indeed, based on their previous experience of the Greeks, the Persians might be excused for this; Herodotus tells us that the Athenians at Marathon were "first to endure looking at Median dress and men wearing it, for up until then just hearing the name of the Medes caused the Hellenes to panic".<ref name = VI112/> Passing through the hail of arrows launched by the Persian army, protected for the most part by their armour, the Greek line finally collided with the enemy army. Holland provides an evocative description:

<blockquote>The enemy directly in their path&nbsp;... realised to their horror that [the Athenians], far from providing the easy pickings for their bowmen, as they had first imagined, were not going to be halted&nbsp;... The impact was devastating. The Athenians had honed their style of fighting in combat with other phalanxes, wooden shields smashing against wooden shields, iron spear tips clattering against breastplates of bronze&nbsp;... in those first terrible seconds of collision, there was nothing but a pulverizing crash of metal into flesh and bone; then the rolling of the Athenian tide over men wearing, at most, quilted jerkins for protection, and armed, perhaps, with nothing more than bows or slings. The hoplites' ash spears, rather than shivering&nbsp;... could instead stab and stab again, and those of the enemy who avoided their fearful jabbing might easily be crushed to death beneath the sheer weight of the advancing men of bronze.<ref name = "h194">Holland, pp. 194–197</ref></blockquote>

The Athenian wings quickly routed the inferior Persian levies on the flanks, before turning inwards to surround the Persian centre, which had been more successful against the thin Greek centre.<ref name= VI113/> The battle ended when the Persian centre then broke in panic towards their ships, pursued by the Greeks.<ref name= VI113>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.113.1 VI, 113]</ref> Some, unaware of the local terrain, ran towards the swamps where unknown numbers drowned.<ref name="Pausanias I, 32">Pausanias I, 32</ref><ref>Lazenby, p. 71</ref> The Athenians pursued the Persians back to their ships, and managed to capture seven ships, though the majority were able to launch successfully.<ref name = VI115>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.115.1 VI, 115]</ref><ref name = VI114>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.114.1 VI, 114]</ref> Herodotus recounts the story that [[Cynaegirus]], brother of the playwright [[Aeschylus]], who was also among the fighters, charged into the sea, grabbed one Persian trireme, and started pulling it towards shore. A member of the crew saw him, cut off his hand, and Cynaegirus died.<ref name = VI114/>

Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield, and it is unknown how many more perished in the swamps.<ref name = VI117>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231023;layout=;loc=6.116.1 VI, 117]</ref> The Athenians lost 192 men and the Plataeans 11.<ref name = VI117/> Among the dead were the war [[archon]] Callimachus and the general Stesilaos.<ref name = VI114/>

== Aftermath ==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}

In the immediate aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.<ref name = VI115/> As has been discussed [[#Prelude|above]], some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle. Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back to Athens.<ref name = VI116>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231022;layout=;loc=6.115.1 VI, 116]</ref>
The two tribes which had been in the centre of the Athenian line stayed to guard the battlefield under the command of Aristides.<ref>Holland, p. 218</ref> The Athenians arrived in time to prevent the Persians from securing a landing, and seeing that the opportunity was lost, the Persians turned about and returned to Asia.<ref name = VI116/> Connected with this episode, Herodotus recounts a rumour that this manoeuver by the Persians had been planned in conjunction with the [[Alcmaeonid]]s, the prominent Athenian aristocratic family, and that a "shield-signal" had been given after the battle.<ref name = VI115/> Although many interpretations of this have been offered, it is impossible to tell whether this was true, and if so, what exactly the signal meant.<ref>Lazenby, pp. 72–73</ref> On the next day, the Spartan army arrived at Marathon, having covered the {{convert|220|km|mi|sp=us}} in only three days. The Spartans toured the battlefield at Marathon, and agreed that the Athenians had won a great victory.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.120 VI, 120]</ref>

[[Image:Hill where the Athenians were buried after the Battle of Marathon.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Hill where the Athenian dead were buried after the Battle of Marathon]]

The dead of Marathon were buried on the battlefield. On the tomb of the Athenians this [[epigram]] composed by Simonides was written:

:Ἑλλήνων προμαχοῦντες Ἀθηναῖοι Μαραθῶνι
:χρυσοφόρων Μήδων ἐστόρεσαν δύναμιν

:Fighting in the forefront of the Hellenes, the Athenians at Marathon
:destroyed the might of the gold-bearing Medes.

In the meanwhile, Darius began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.<ref name = h203>Holland, p. 203</ref> Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.<ref>Holland, pp. 206–207</ref> Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.<ref name = h208>Holland, pp. 208–211</ref> The epic [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] finally began in 480 BC, and the Persians met with initial success at the battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]].<ref>Lazenby, p. 151</ref> However, defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]] would be the turning point in the campaign,<ref>Lazenby, p. 197</ref> and the next year the expedition was ended by the decisive Greek victory at the [[Battle of Plataea]].<ref>Holland, pp. 350–355</ref>

== Significance ==
[[Image:ROM-CorinthianHelmetAndSkull-BattleOfMarathon.png|thumb|right|180px|Greek [[Corinthian helmet|Corinthian-style helmet]] and the skull reportedly found inside it from the Battle of Marathon, now residing in the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], Toronto.]]

The defeat at Marathon barely touched the vast resources of the Persian empire, yet for the Greeks it was an enormously significant victory. It was the first time the Greeks had beaten the Persians, proving that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.<ref>Holland, p. 201</ref>

The battle was a defining moment for the young Athenian democracy, showing what might be achieved through unity and self-belief; indeed, the battle effectively marks the start of a "golden age" for Athens.<ref name = h138>Holland, p. 138</ref> This was also applicable to Greece as a whole; "their victory endowed the Greeks with a faith in their destiny that was to endure for three centuries, during which western culture was born".<ref name = "hxvi">Holland, pp xvi–xvii</ref><ref name = "jfc">Fuller, pp. 11–32</ref> [[John Stuart Mill]]'s famous opinion was that "the Battle of Marathon, even as an event in British history, is more important than the [[Battle of Hastings]]".<ref name = "BDLI">Powell ''et al.'', 2001</ref> It seems that the Athenian playwright [[Aeschylus]] considered his participation at Marathon to be his greatest achievement in life (rather than his plays) since on his gravestone there was the following epigram:

:{{lang|grc|Αἰσχύλον Εὐφορίωνος Ἀθηναῖον τόδε κεύθει}}
:{{lang|grc|μνῆμα καταφθίμενον πυροφόροιο Γέλας·}}
:{{lang|grc|ἀλκὴν δ’ εὐδόκιμον Μαραθώνιον ἄλσος ἂν εἴποι}}
:{{lang|grc|καὶ βαθυχαιτήεις Μῆδος ἐπιστάμενος}}

:This tomb the dust of Aeschylus doth hide,
:Euphorion's son and fruitful Gela's pride.
:How tried his valor, Marathon may tell,
:And long-haired Medes, who knew it all too well.<ref>''Anthologiae Graecae Appendix'', vol. 3, ''Epigramma sepulcrale'' p. 17</ref>

Militarily, a major lesson for the Greeks was the potential of the hoplite phalanx. This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, the advantages and disadvantages of the hoplite phalanx had not been obvious.<ref name = "h194"/> Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how effective the hoplites could be in battle.<ref name = "h194"/> The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the [[Battle of Plataea]]), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon.<ref name = "h344">Holland, pp. 344–352</ref>

== Legacy ==

=== Legends associated with the battle ===
The most famous legend associated with Marathon is that of the runner [[Pheidippides]]/[[Pheidippides|Philippides]] bringing news to Athens of the battle, which is described [[#Marathon run|below]].

[[Image:Pan satyre della Valle.jpg|thumb|left|150px|upright|Statue of Pan, Capitoline Museum, Rome]]

Pheidippides' run to Sparta to bring aid has other legends associated with it. Herodotus mentions that Pheidippides was visited by the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] on his way to Sparta (or perhaps on his return journey).<ref name = "h187"/> Pan asked why the Athenians did not honor him and the awed Pheidippides promised that they would do so from then on. The god apparently felt that the promise would be kept, so he appeared in battle and at the crucial moment he instilled the Persians with his own brand of fear, the mindless, frenzied fear that bore his name: "[[panic]]". After the battle, a sacred precinct was established for Pan in a grotto on the north slope of the Acropolis, and a sacrifice was annually offered.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.105 VI, 105]</ref>

Similarly, after the victory the festival of the ''Agroteras Thysia'' ("sacrifice to the Agrotéra") was held at [[Agrae]] near [[Athens]], in honor of [[Artemis]] [[Agrotera]] ("Artemis the Huntress"). This was in fulfillment of a vow made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats equal to that of the [[Persia]]ns slain in the conflict. The number was so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled. [[Xenophon]] notes that at his time, 90 years after the battle, goats were still offered yearly.<ref>Plutarch, ''On the Malice of Herodotus'', 26</ref><ref>Xenophon, ''Anabasis'' III, 2</ref><ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia'' II, 25</ref><ref>Aristophanes, ''The Knights'', 660</ref>

Plutarch mentions that the Athenians saw the phantom of King [[Theseus]], the mythical hero of Athens, leading the army in full battle gear in the charge against the Persians,<ref>Plutarch, ''Theseus'', 35</ref> and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the [[Stoa Poikile]] fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes.<ref>Pausanias I, 15</ref> Pausanias also tells us that:{{imagequote2|They say too that there chanced to be present in the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus ("he of the Plough-tail") as a hero."''<ref name="Pausanias I, 32"/>}}

Another tale from the conflict is of the dog of Marathon. [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] relates that one hoplite brought his dog to the Athenian encampment. The dog followed his master to battle and attacked the Persians at his master's side. He also informs us that this dog is depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile.<ref>Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' VII, 38</ref>{{-}}

=== Marathon run ===
{{Main|Marathon}}
[[Image:1896 Olympic marathon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1896 Olympic marathon]]
According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named [[Pheidippides]] was sent to run from [[Athens]] to [[Sparta]] to ask for assistance before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta the day after he left.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.105 VI, 105–106]</ref> Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 (25 miles) or so kilometers back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, in time to see the Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.<ref name = "h198">Holland, p. 198</ref>

Later, in popular imagination, these two events became confused with each other, leading to a legendary but inaccurate version of events. This myth has Pheidippides running from Marathon to Athens after the battle, to announce the Greek victory with the word "Nenikēkamen!" ([[Ancient Greek|Attic]]: {{lang|grc|Νενικήκαμεν}} (We were victorious!)), whereupon he promptly died of exhaustion. Most accounts incorrectly attribute this story to Herodotus; actually, the story first appears in [[Plutarch]]'s ''On the Glory of Athens'' in the 1st century AD, who quotes from [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heracleides of Pontus]]'s lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.<ref>Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 347C</ref> [[Lucian of Samosata]] (2nd century AD) gives the same story but names the runner Philippides (not Pheidippides).<ref>Lucian, III</ref> It should be noted that in some medieval codices of Herodotus the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta before the battle is given as Philippides and in a few modern editions this name is preferred.<ref>Lazenby, p. 52</ref>

When the idea of a modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] became a reality at the end of the 19th century, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the ancient glory of Greece.<ref name = AIMS/> The idea of organizing a 'marathon race' came from [[Michel Bréal]], who wanted the event to feature in the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as the Greeks.<ref name = "AIMS">{{cite web|url=http://aimsworldrunning.org/marathon_history.htm|title=Marathon History|accessdate=2008-10-15|author=AIMS}}</ref> This would echo the legendary version of events, with the competitors running from Marathon to Athens. So popular was this event that it quickly caught on, becoming a fixture at the Olympic games, with major cities staging their own annual events.<ref name = AIMS/> The distance eventually became fixed at 26 miles 385 yards, or 42.195&nbsp;km, though for the first years it was variable, being around {{convert|25|mi|km}}—the approximate distance from Marathon to Athens.<ref name = "AIMS"/>

=== Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ===
{{Main|Epizelus}}

[[Herodotus]]' account of the battle may point to the first recorded case of [[Posttraumatic Stress Disorder]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} During the battle, an [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] named [[Epizelus]] became instantly and permanently blind without having been struck. <ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh6110.htm Herodotus Book 6: Erato, 117] "an Athenian, Epizelos the son of Cuphagoras, while fighting in the close combat and proving himself a good man, was deprived of the sight of his eyes, neither having received a blow in any part of his body nor having been hit with a missile, and for the rest of his life from this time he continued to be blind"</ref>
