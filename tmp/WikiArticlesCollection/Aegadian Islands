The '''Aegadian Islands ''' ([[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]: '''''Ìsuli Ègadi''''', {{lang-it|'''Isole Egadi'''}}; {{lang-la|'''Aegates Insulae'''}}, {{lang-el|'''Aegatae Nisoi''', ''Αιγάται Νήσοι''}}, meaning ''the islands of goats'') are a group of small mountainous islands in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] off the northwest coast of [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], near the cities of [[Trapani]] and [[Marsala]], with a total area of {{convert|37.45|km2|sqmi|2}}.

[[Favignana]] (''Aegusa''), the largest, lies {{convert|16|km|mi}} south west of Trapani; [[Levanzo]] (''Phorbantia'') {{convert|13|km|mi}} west; while [[Marettimo]], the ancient ''Iera Nesos'', {{convert|24|km|mi}} west of Trapani, is now reckoned as a part of the group. There are also two minor islands, Formica and Maraone, lying between Levanzo and Sicily. For administrative purposes the archipelago constitutes the comune of Favignana in the [[Province of Trapani]].

The overall population in 1987 was estimated at about 5,000. Winter frost is unknown and rainfall is low. The main occupation of the islanders is fishing, and the largest [[tuna]] fishery in Sicily is here.

==History==
There is evidence of [[Neolithic]] and even [[Paleolithic]] paintings in caves on Levanzo, and to a lesser extent on Favignana.

The islands were the scene of the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] of 241 BC, in which the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] fleet was defeated by the Roman fleet led by [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus|C. Lutatius Catulus]]; the engagement ended the [[First Punic War]]. After the end of [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] power in the first millennium AD, the islands, to the extent that they were governed at all, were part of territories of Goths, Vandals, Saracens, before the [[Normans]] fortified Favignana in 1081.

The islands belonged to the Pallavicini-Rusconi family of [[Genoa]] until 1874, when they were bought by the [[Florio]] family of [[Palermo]].
