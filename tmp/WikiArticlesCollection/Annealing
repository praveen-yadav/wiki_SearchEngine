'''Annealing''' may refer to:

*[[Annealing (metallurgy)]], a heat treatment that alters the microstructure of a material causing changes in properties such as strength, hardness, and ductility
*[[Annealing (glass)]], heating a piece of glass to remove stress
*[[Nucleic acid thermodynamics]], includes the annealing of DNA or RNA pairing by hydrogen bonds to a complementary sequence, forming a double-stranded polynucleotide
*[[Simulated annealing]], a technique for searching for a solution in a space otherwise too large for ordinary search methods to yield results
*[[Quantum annealing]], a method for finding solutions to combinatorial optimisation problems and ground states of glassy systems using quantum fluctuations
