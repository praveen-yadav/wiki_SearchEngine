'''Aurelius Ambrosius''', better known in English as '''Saint Ambrose''' (c. 340{{spaced ndash}}4 April 397), was an [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|archbishop of Milan]] who became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century. He was one of the four original [[doctors of the Church]]. He is [[patron saint]] of Milan. He is notable for his influence on [[St. Augustine]].

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Ambrose was born into a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Christian]] family about 340 and was raised in [[Trier]].<ref name="CE">{{CathEncy |wstitle=St. Ambrose}}</ref> His father was Aurelius Ambrosius,<ref>{{Citation | last = Greenslade | first = Stanley Lawrence | title = Early Latin theology: selections from Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, and Jerome | volume = 5 | series = Library of Christian classics | place = Westminster | publisher = John Knox Press | year = 1956 | page = 175}}</ref>{{Sfn | Paredi | 1964 | p = 380 | ps = : “S. Paulinus in ''Vit. Ambr. 3'' has the following: ''posito in administratione praefecturae Galliarum patre eius Ambrosio natus est Ambrosius''. From this, practically all of Ambrose's biographers have concluded that Ambrose's father was praetorian prefect in Gaul. This is the only evidence we have, however, that there ever was an Ambrose as prefect in Gaul."}} the [[Praetorian prefecture of Gaul|praetorian prefect of Gaul]];{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} his mother was a woman of intellect and piety. Ambrose's siblings, [[Satyrus of Milan|Satyrus]] (who is the subject of Ambrose's ''De excessu fratris Satyri'') and [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]], are also venerated as saints.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90298 | title = Santi Beati | place = [[Italy|IT]] | language = Italian}}</ref> There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of [[bee]]s settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of [[honey]]. His father considered this a [[Christian symbolism|sign]] of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue. For this reason, bees and [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehives]] often appear in the [[Saint symbolism|saint's symbology]].

After the early death of his father, Ambrose followed his father's career. He was educated in Rome, studying [[literature]], [[law]], and [[rhetoric]].<ref name="DGRBM">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Smith | first = Philip | authorlink = Philip Smith (lexicographer) | title = St. Ambrosius | editor-link = William Smith (lexicographer)| editor-first = William | editor-last = Smith | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 139–40 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0148.html}}</ref> [[Praetorian prefect of Italy|Praetorian prefect]] [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus|Probus]] first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him [[consular prefect]] or "Governor" of [[Liguria]] and [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], with headquarters at [[Milan]], which was then (beside Rome) the second capital in Italy.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}}

Ambrose was the Governor of Aemilia-Liguria in northern Italy until 374 when he became the Bishop of Milan. He was a very popular political figure, and since he was the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West, he was a recognizable figure in the court of the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Valentinian I]]. Ambrose never married.

=== Bishop of Milan ===
[[Image:Sant'Ambrogio Cript in Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, Milan.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The body of Ambrose (with white vestments) in the crypt of Sant'Ambrogio basilica.]]
In the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the [[diocese of Milan]] between the Catholics and [[Arianism|Arians]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Wilken | title = The Spirit of Early Christian Thought | publisher = Yale University Press | publisher = New Haven | year = 2003 | page = 218}}</ref>{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}} In 374 [[Auxentius of Milan|the bishop of Milan, Auxentius]], an Arian, died, and the Arians challenged the [[Apostolic succession|succession]]. Ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place, to prevent an uproar, which was probable in this crisis. His address was interrupted by a call "Ambrose, bishop!", which was taken up by the whole assembly.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}}

Ambrose was known to be Catholic in belief, but also acceptable to Arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard. At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared: Ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in [[theology]].{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}} Upon his appointment, Ambrose fled to a colleague's home seeking to hide. Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor [[Gratianus|Gratian]] praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions, Ambrose's host gave him up. Within a week, he was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of [[Milan]].

As bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, donating all of his land, making only provision for his sister [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]] (who later became a nun),<ref name = "CE" /> and committed the care of his family to his brother. Ambrose also wrote a treatise by the name of "The Goodness of Death".

=== Arianism ===
According to legend, Ambrose immediately and forcefully stopped [[Arianism]] in Milan. He studied theology with [[Simplician]], a [[presbyter]] of Rome. Using his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, to his advantage, he studied the Old Testament and Greek authors like [[Philo]], [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and [[Basil of Caesarea]], with whom he was also exchanging letters.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Schaff | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cxcviii.html | title = Letter of Basil to Ambrose | publisher = Christian Classics Ethereal library | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}</ref> He applied this knowledge as preacher, concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament, and his rhetorical abilities impressed [[Augustine of Hippo]], who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers.

In the confrontation with Arians, Ambrose sought to theologically refute their propositions, which were contrary to the [[Nicene creed]] and thus officially defined orthodoxy. The Arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires. Although the western Emperor [[Gratian]] supported orthodoxy, the younger [[Valentinian II]], who became his colleague in the Empire, adhered to the Arian creed.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose did not sway the young prince's position. In the East, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] likewise professed the Nicene creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions, especially among the higher clergy.

In this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops [[Palladius of Ratiaria|Palladius]] of [[Ratiaria]] and [[Secundian (bishop)|Secundian]]us of [[Singidunum]], confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a [[ecunmeical council|general council]] from all parts of the empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation. However, Ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops. Accordingly, a [[Council of Aquileia, 381|synod]] composed of thirty-two bishops was held at [[Aquileia]] in the year 381. Ambrose was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined. A vote was then taken, when Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices.

Nevertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose. In 385{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} or 386 the emperor and his mother [[Justina (empress)|Justina]], along with a considerable number of [[clergy]] and [[laity]], especially military, professed Arianism. They demanded two churches in [[Milan]], one in the city (the [[Basilica]] of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), to the Arians.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} He went, his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was performing [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine service]] in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs. As he still refused, certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica, by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons{{sfn|Butler|1991|p=408}} to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of [[Easter]].

In spite of Imperial opposition, Bishop Ambrose declared:
{{quote |If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of Christ. I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert it. The tumult of the people I will not encourage: but God alone can appease it.}}

=== Judaism ===
[[File:AmbroseGiuLungara.jpg|thumb|alt=painting of St. Ambrose|Painting of St. Ambrose with whip and book in the church of San Giuseppe alla Lungara, Rome]]An address by Ambrose to Christian young people warns them against intermarriage with Jews ("De Abrahamo," ix. 84, xiv. 451). But his opposition assumed a more active character in the matter of the bishop of Callinicum in [[Mesopotamia]]. It appears that in 388 a mob, led by the local bishop and many monks, destroyed the [[synagogue]] at Callinicum. The emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] ordered the rebuilding of the synagogue at the expense of the rioters, including the bishop. Ambrose immediately issued a fiery protest to the Emperor. He writes to Theodosius ("Epistolæ," xl. xvi. 1101 et seq.) that "the glory of God" is concerned in this matter, and that therefore he cannot be silent. "Shall the bishop be compelled to reerect a synagogue? Can he religiously do this thing? If he obey the emperor, he will become a traitor to his faith; if he disobey him, a [[martyr]]. What real wrong is there, after all, in destroying a synagogue, a 'home of perfidy, a home of impiety,' in which Christ is daily blasphemed? Indeed, he must consider himself no less guilty than this poor bishop; at least to the extent that he made no concealment of his wish that all synagogues should be destroyed, that no such places of blasphemy be further allowed to exist." At the end, he succeeded in obtaining from Theodosius a promise that the sentence should be completely revoked, with the very natural consequence that thereafter the prospect of immunity thus afforded occasioned spoliations of synagogues all over the Empire. That Ambrose could nevertheless occasionally say a good word for the Jews is shown by a passage in his "Enarratio in Psalmos" (i. 41, xiv. 943), in which he remarks, "Some Jews exhibit purity of life and much diligence and love of study."

=== Imperial relations ===
[[Image:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|''Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius'' by [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]].]]
The imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of Ambrose, however his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor. When [[Magnus Maximus]] usurped the supreme power in [[Gaul]], and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful.

A second later embassy was unsuccessful; the enemy entered [[Italy]]; and [[Milan]] was taken. Justina and her son fled; but Ambrose remained at his post, and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief.

In 385 Ambrose, backed by Milan's populace, refused [[Valentinian II]]'s imperial request to hand over the Portian basilica for the use of Arian troops. In 386 Justina and Valentinian received the Arian bishop [[Auxentius of Durostorum|Auxentius the younger]], and Ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage. Ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Cambridge Ancient History | page = 106}}</ref>

[[Theodosius I]], the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of Justina, and regained the kingdom. Theodosius was [[Excommunication#Roman_Catholic_Church|excommunicated]] by Ambrose for the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|massacre]] of 7,000 persons at [[Thessalonika|Thessalonica]] in 390, after the murder of the Roman governor there by rioters.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate [[David (biblical king)|David]] in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt&nbsp;— Ambrose readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance. Ambrose also forced Theodosius to retreat from compensating a Jewish community in Mesopotamia when a synagogue was burnt down by militant Christians.<ref>{{Citation | first = Diarmaid | last = MacCulloch | title = Christianity | publisher = Yale University Press | publisher = Viking | year = 2009 | page = 300}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/primary-texts-from-the-history-of-the-relationship/248-ambrose-of-milan-qletters-about-a-synagogue-burningq-aug-388 |title=News |accessdate=September 25, 2013 |author=Ambrose of Milan |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=388 |month=August |work= AMBROSE OF MILAN, "Letters about a Synagogue Burning" (August, 388) |publisher=Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian relations |pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=if I were pleading according to the law of nations, I could tell how many of the Church's basilicas the Jews burnt in the time of the Emperor Julian: two at Damascus, one of which is scarcely now repaired, and this at the cost of the Church, not of the Synagogue; the other basilica still is a rough mass of shapeless ruins. Basilicas were burnt at Gaza, Ascalon, Beirut, and in almost every place in those parts, and no one demanded punishment. And at Alexandria a basilica, which alone surpassed all the rest, was burnt by pagans and Jews.}}</ref> These incidents show the strong position of a bishop in the Western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor&nbsp;— the controversy of [[John Chrysostom]] with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop.

In 392, after the death of [[Valentinian II]] and the acclamation of [[Eugenius]], Ambrose supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius after Theodosius was eventually victorious.

==== Persecution of Paganism ====
{{main|Persecution of Paganism under the influence of Saint Ambrose}}
Under Ambrose's major influence, emperors [[Gratian]], [[Valentinian II]] and [[Theodosius I]] carried on a persecution of [[Paganism]].<ref name="Byfield2003">Byfield (2003) pp. 92–4: ‘In the west, such [anti-Pagan] tendencies were less pronounces, although they had one especially powerful advocate. No one was more determined to destroy paganism than Ambrose, bishop of Milan, a major influence upon both Gratian and Valentinian II. [p. 94] The man who ruled the ruler — Wether Ambrose, the senator-bureaucrat-turned-bishop. was Theodosius's mentor or his autocrat, the emperor heeded him — as did most of the fourth-century church’.</ref><ref name="MacMullen1984p100">MacMullen (1984) p. 100: ‘The law of June 391, issued by Theodosius [...] was issued from Milan and represented the will of its bishop, Ambrose; for Theodosius—recently excommunicated by Ambrose, penitent, and very much under his influence<sup>43</sup> — was no natural zealot. Ambrose, on the other hand, was very much a Christian. His restless and imperious ambition for the church's growth, come what might for the non-Christians, is suggested by his preaching’. See also note 43 at p. 163, with references to Palanque (1933), Gaudemet (1972), Matthews (1975) and King (1961)</ref><ref>Roldanus (2006) p. 148</ref><ref>Hellemo (1989) p. 254</ref> Under Ambrose's influence, Theodosius issued the 391 "[[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I#Theodosian decrees (389–391)|Theodosian decrees]]," which with increasing intensity outlawed Pagan practises,<ref name="MacMullen1984p100" /><ref name="King1961p78">King (1961) p. 78</ref> and the [[Altar of Victory]] was removed by Gratian. Ambrose prevailed upon Gratian, Valentinian and Theodosius to reject requests to restore the Altar.

=== Death and legacy ===
Soon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the [[Roman empire]], Theodosius died at Milan in 395, and two years later (April 4, 397) Ambrose also died. He was succeeded as bishop of Milan by [[Simplician]]. Ambrose's body may still be viewed in the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|church of S. Ambrogio]] in Milan, where it has been continuously venerated&nbsp;— along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of [[Sts. Gervase and Protase]]&nbsp;— and is one of the oldest extant bodies of historical personages known outside [[Egypt]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

=== Character ===
[[Image:AmbroseStatue.png|thumb|left|100px|Drawing based on a statue of St. Ambrose]]
Many circumstances in the history of Ambrose are characteristic of the general spirit of the times. The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period. But it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people.

He was generous to the [[poverty|poor]]; it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship. It is alleged, too, that at a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two [[martyr]]s, [[Gervasius]] and [[Protasius (bishop of Milan)|Protasius]]. The saints, although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old, looked as if they had just died. The applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party.

== Theology ==
Ambrose ranks with [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Jerome]], and [[Gregory the Great]], as one of the [[Latin]] [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]]. Theologians compare him with [[Hilary of Poitiers|Hilary]], who they claim fell short of Ambrose's administrative excellence but demonstrated greater [[theology|theological]] ability. He succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of [[Biblical]] and [[doctrinal]] subjects. His spiritual successor, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], whose conversion was helped by Ambrose's [[sermon]]s, owes more to him than to any writer except [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]{{Citation needed|date= June 2007}}.

Ambrose's intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing [[doctrine]] of the Church and its [[sacerdotal]] ministry, while the prevalent [[asceticism]] of the day, continuing the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Cicero]]nian training of his youth, enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian [[ethics]]. Thus we have the ''De officiis ministrorum'', ''De viduis'', ''De virginitate'' and ''De paenitentia''.

Ambrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God, and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place. His advice to Augustine of Hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom. "When I am at Rome, I fast on a Saturday; when I am at Milan, I do not. Follow the custom of the church where you are."<ref>{{Citation | first = Augustine | last = of Hippo | title = Epistle to Januarius | at = II, section 18}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Augustine | last = of Hippo | title = Epistle to Casualanus | at = XXXVI, section 32}}</ref> Thus Ambrose refused to be drawn into a false conflict over which particular local church had the "right" liturgical form where there was no substantial problem. His advice has remained in the English language as the saying, "[[wikt:when in Rome, do as the Romans do|When in Rome, do as the Romans do.]]"

One interpretation of Ambrose's writings is that he was a [[Christian universalism|Christian universalist]].<ref name="hanson">{{Citation | first = JW | last = Hanson | title = Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine of The Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years | url = http://hellbusters.8m.com/upd18.html | chapter = 18. Additional Authorities | place = Boston and Chicago | publisher = Universalist Publishing House | year = 1899 | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}</ref> It has been noted that Ambrose's theology was significantly influenced by that of [[Origen]] and [[Didymus the Blind]], two other early Christian universalists.<ref name="hanson" /> One quotation cited in favor of this belief:
{{quote |Our Savior has appointed two kinds of resurrection in the Apocalypse. 'Blessed is he that hath part in the first resurrection,' for such come to grace without the judgment. As for those who do not come to the first, but are reserved unto the second resurrection, these shall be disciplined until their appointed times, between the first and the second resurrection.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.tentmaker.org/Quotes/churchfathersquotes.htm | title = The Church Fathers on Universalism | publisher = Tentmaker | accessdate = December 5, 2007}}</ref>}}

One could interpret this passage as being another example of the mainstream Christian belief in a general resurrection (both for those in heaven and for those in hell). Several other works by Ambrose clearly teach the mainstream view of salvation. For example:
{{quote |The Jews feared to believe in manhood taken up into God, ''and therefore have lost the grace of redemption'', because they reject that on which salvation depends.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ambrose | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/34043.htm | contribution = Exposition of the Christian Faith, Book III | title = The Catholic Encyclopedia | year = 1907 | place = New York | publisher = Robert Appleton Co | accessdate = February 24, 2009}} from New Advent.</ref>}}

== Mariology ==
[[File:Francisco de Zurbarán 032.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''St. Ambrose'', by [[Francisco de Zurbarán]]]]
The powerful Mariology of Ambrose of Milan influenced contemporary Popes like [[Pope Damasus I|Pope Damasus]] and [[Siricius]] and later, [[Pope Leo the Great]]. Central to Ambrose is the [[virginity]] of Mary and her role as [[Mother of God]].

* The virgin birth is worthy of God. Which human birth would have been more worthy of God, than the one, in which the Immaculate Son of God maintained the purity of his immaculate origin while becoming human?<ref>Ambrose of Milan [[CSEL]] 64, 139</ref>

* We confess, that Christ the Lord was born from a virgin, and therefore we reject the natural order of things. Because not from a man she conceived but from the Holy Spirit.<ref>Ambrose of Milan, De Mysteriis, 59, PG 16, 410</ref>

* Christ is not divided but one. If we adore him as the Son of God, we do not deny his birth from the virgin… But nobody shall extend this to Mary. Mary was the temple of God but not God in the temple. Therefore only the one who was in the temple can be worshipped.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf210.iv.ii.iv.xi.html?highlight=mary,was,the,temple,of,god,but,not,in#highlight Ambrose of Milan, De Spiritu Sancto, III, 11,79-80]</ref>

* Yes, truly blessed for having surpassed the priest (Zechariah). While the priest denied, the Virgin rectified the error. No wonder that the Lord, wishing to rescue the world, began his work with Mary. Thus she, through whom salvation was being prepared for all people, would be the first to receive the promised fruit of salvation.<ref>Ambrose of Milan, Expositio in Lucam 2, 17; PL 15, 1640</ref>

Ambrose viewed [[virginity]] as superior to marriage and saw [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mary]] as the model of virginity.<ref>''De virginibus'' (On Virgins); ''De virginitate''</ref> He is alleged to have founded an institution for virgins in Rome.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

== Writings ==
In matters of [[exegesis]] he is, like Hilary, an [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian]]. In [[dogma]] he follows [[Basil of Caesarea]] and other Greek authors, but nevertheless gives a distinctly Western cast to the speculations of which he treats. This is particularly manifest in the weightier emphasis which he lays upon human [[sin]] and [[divine grace]], and in the place which he assigns to [[faith]] in the individual Christian life.

== Church music ==
[[Image:Saint Ambrose in His Study 1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Saint Ambrose in His Study'', ca. 1500. Spanish, Palencia. Wood with traces of polychromy. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]].]]
{{Main|Ambrosian Hymnography}}

Ambrose is traditionally credited but not actually known to have composed any of the repertory of [[Ambrosian chant]] also known simply as "antiphonal [[chant]]", a method of chanting where one side of the choir alternately responds to the other. (The later pope St. [[Gregory I the Great]] is not known to have composed any [[Gregorian chant]], the [[plainsong]] or "[[Romish chant]]".) However, Ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the Church; he is credited with introducing [[hymnody]] from the Eastern Church into the West.

Catching the impulse from [[Hilary of Arles|Hilary]] and confirmed in it by the success of Arian [[psalmody]], Ambrose composed several original [[hymn]]s as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies. Each of these hymns has eight four-line [[stanza]]s and is written in strict iambic dimeter (that is 2 x 2 iambs).
Marked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times.
* ''Deus Creator Omnium''
* ''Aeterne rerum conditor''
* ''Jam surgit hora tertia''
* ''Jam Christus astra ascendante"
* ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'' (a [[Christmas]] hymn)

In his writings, Ambrose refers only to the performance of [[psalms]], in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an ''[[antiphon]]''.

St. Ambrose was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn ''[[Te Deum]]'', which he is said to have composed when he baptised [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]], his celebrated convert.

Ambrose was Bishop of Milan at the time of Augustine's conversion, and is mentioned in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]''.

=== Celibacy ===
In a passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' in which Augustine wonders why he could not share his burden with Ambrose, he makes a comment which bears on the history of celibacy:
{{quote|Ambrose himself I esteemed a happy man, as the world counted happiness, because great personages held him in honor. Only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden.<ref name="AugustineOnAmbrose">Augustine. ''Confessions'' Book Six, Chapter Three.</ref>}}

=== Reading ===
In this same passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' is a curious anecdote which bears on the history of reading:
{{quote |When [Ambrose] read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still. Anyone could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud.<ref name="AugustineOnAmbrose" />}}

This is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion. The practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become. In a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds, in which the production of books was very labor-intensive, the majority of the population was illiterate, and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them, written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection. However, there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/jul/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview27 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Read my lips | first=James | last=Fenton | date=July 28, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first =

==In popular culture==
In the 2012 film ''[[Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine]]'', Bishop Ambrose is portrayed by Italian actor [[Andrea Giordana]].

Several of Ambrose's works have recently been published in the bilingual Latin-German [[Fontes Christiani]] series (currently edited by [[Brepols]]).

Several religious brotherhoods which have sprung up in and around Milan at various times since the 14th century have been called Ambrosians. Their connection to Ambrose is tenuous
