'''Darwin''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑr|w|ɨ|n}}<ref>''[[Macquarie Dictionary|Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition]]'' (2005). Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. ISBN 1-876429-14-3</ref>
is the [[List of Australian capital cities|capital city]] of the [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]]. Situated on the [[Timor Sea]], Darwin is the most populated of the two cities in the sparsely populated Northern Territory, with a  population of 129,062. It is the smallest and most northerly of the Australian capital cities, and acts as the [[Top End]]'s regional centre. Darwin has grown from a pioneer outpost and small port into one of Australia's most modern cities.

Darwin's proximity to South East Asia makes it an important Australian gateway to countries such as [[Indonesia]] and [[East Timor]]. The [[Stuart Highway]] begins in Darwin, ending at [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] in South Australia. The city itself is built on a low bluff overlooking the harbour. Its [[list of Darwin suburbs|suburbs]] spread out over some area, beginning at [[Lee Point, Northern Territory|Lee Point]] in the north and stretching to [[Berrimah, Northern Territory|Berrimah]] in the east. Past Berrimah, the Stuart Highway goes on to Darwin's [[satellite city]], [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], and [[List of Palmerston suburbs|its suburbs]]. The region, like the rest of the Top End, has a tropical climate, with a [[wet season|wet]] and a [[dry season]]. The city is noted for its consistently warm to hot climate, all throughout the year. Prone to cyclone activity during the wet season, Darwin experiences heavy monsoonal down pours and spectacular lightning shows.<ref name="GUM">{{cite web | title = Lightning Storms in the Top End |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/scribblygum/december2002/default.htm | date = 10 December 2002 | accessdate =27 July 2008 }}</ref> During the dry season, the city is met with blue skies and gentle sea breezes from the picturesque harbour.

The greater Darwin area is the ancestral home of the [[Larrakia]] people. On 9 September 1839, [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] sailed into Darwin harbour during its surveying of the area. [[John Clements Wickham]] named the region "Port Darwin" in honour of their former shipmate [[Charles Darwin]], who had sailed with them on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|ship's previous voyage]] which had ended in October 1836. The settlement there became the town of Palmerston in 1869, and was renamed Darwin in 1911.<ref name="urlDarwin - Northern Territory - Australia - Travel - smh.com.au">{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Northern-Territory/Darwin/2005/02/17/1108500201604.html |title=Darwin – Northern Territory – Australia – Travel – smh.com.au |date=8 February 2004 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |quote= |accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> Having been almost entirely rebuilt twice, once due to [[Bombing of Darwin|Japanese air raids]] during World War II, and again after being devastated by [[Cyclone Tracy]] in 1974, the city is one of Australia's most modern capitals.<ref name="DCC">{{cite web | title = A brief history of Darwin   | publisher=Darwin City Council |url=http://www.darcity.nt.gov.au/aboutdarwin/history/a_brief_history.htm | accessdate =29 December 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Darwin (Northern Territory, Australia) | encyclopaedia = Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/151900/Darwin | accessdate =13 August 2009 }}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Darwin}}
{{See also|History of the Northern Territory}}
The Aboriginal people of the [[Larrakia]] language group are the traditional custodians and the first inhabitants of the greater Darwin area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larrakia.com/AboutUs.html|title=Our People and History|publisher=Larrakia Nation Aboriginal Corporation}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> They had [[trading routes]] with Southeast Asia (see [[Macassan contact with Australia]]), and imported goods from as far afield as [[South Australia|South]] and Western Australia. Established [[songlines]] penetrated throughout the country, allowing stories and histories to be told and retold along the routes.

The Dutch visited Australia's northern coastline in the 1600s, and created the first European maps of the area. This accounts for the Dutch names in the area, such as [[Arnhem Land]] and [[Groote Eylandt]]. The first British person to see Darwin harbour appears to have been Lieutenant [[John Lort Stokes]] of [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] on 9 September 1839. The ship's captain, Commander [[John Clements Wickham]], named the port after [[Charles Darwin]], the British naturalist who had sailed with them both on the earlier [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second expedition of the ''Beagle'']]. In the early 1870s Darwin felt the effects of a [[Australian gold rushes|gold rush]] at [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]] after employees of the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]] found gold while digging holes for telegraph poles.

In 1859 the colony of [[Queensland]] was excised from [[New South Wales]] and initially included the area of the Northern Territory. Four years later in 1863, the Northern Territory was [[annexed]] from [[Queensland]] by the colony of South Australia. On 5 February 1869, [[George Goyder]], the Surveyor-General of South Australia, established a small settlement of 135 people at Port Darwin. Goyder named the settlement [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], after the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Henry Temple, 3rd&nbsp;Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]. In 1870, the first poles for the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line|Overland Telegraph]] were erected in Darwin, connecting Australia to the rest of the world. The discovery of gold by employees of the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]] digging holes for telegraph poles at [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]] in the 1880s spawned a gold rush which further boosted the young colony's development.

In early 1875 Darwin's European population had grown to approximately 300 because of the gold rush. On 17 February 1875 the [[SS Gothenburg|SS ''Gothenburg'']] left Darwin ''en route'' for [[Adelaide]]. The approximately 88 passengers and 34 crew (surviving records vary) included government officials, circuit-court judges, Darwin residents taking their first [[furlough]], and miners. While travelling south along the north Queensland coast, the ''Gothenburg'' encountered a cyclone-strength storm and was wrecked on a section of the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. Only 22 men survived, while between 98 and 112 people perished. Many passengers who perished were Darwin residents and news of the tragedy severely affected the small community, which reportedly took several years to recover.<ref name = NTLIB>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntlib.nt.gov.au/tracy/advanced/History_Cyclones.html | title = Previous cyclones in Darwin | work=Cyclone Tracy | publisher=Northern Territory Library | date = 21 April 1998 | accessdate =7 January 2008 }}</ref>

The Northern Territory was transferred to federal administration in 1911 and Darwin became the city's official name.

The period between 1911 and 1919 was filled with political turmoil, particularly with trade union unrest, which culminated on 17 December 1918. Led by [[Harold Nelson (Australian politician)|Harold Nelson]], some 1000 demonstrators marched to [[Government House, Darwin|Government House]] at Liberty Square in Darwin where they burnt an [[effigy]] of the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]] [[John A. Gilruth|John Gilruth]] and demanded his resignation. The incident became known as the '[[Darwin Rebellion]]'. Their grievances were against the two main Northern Territory employers: [[Vestey Group|Vestey’s Meatworks]] and the federal government. Both Gilruth and the Vestey company left Darwin soon afterwards.

Around 10,000 [[Allied forces|Allied]] troops arrived in Darwin in the early 1940s at the outset of World War II, in order to defend Australia's northern coastline. On 19 February 1942 at 0957, 188 [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] warplanes [[Bombing of Darwin|attacked Darwin]] in two waves. It was the same fleet that had bombed [[Pearl Harbor]], though a considerably larger number of bombs were dropped on Darwin than on Pearl Harbor. The attack killed at least 243 people and caused immense damage to the town. These were by far the most serious attacks on Australia in time of war, in terms of fatalities and damage. They were the first of [[Air raids on Australia, 1942-43|many raids]] on Darwin.
<!-- The statement about Sydney and Newcastle was wrong; there were about 100 air raids, including one on Broome which killed more than 80 people. -->

Despite this major attack, Darwin's development was furthered considerably during the war, with sealed roads constructed connecting the region to [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] in the south and [[Mount Isa, Queensland|Mount Isa]] in the south-east, and Manton Dam built in the south to provide the city with water. On [[Australia Day]] (26 January) 1959, Darwin was granted city status.<ref>[http://www.australiadaynt.com.au/fun/quiz/quiz2004.html Australia Day (Darwin)]</ref>

On 25 December 1974, Darwin was struck by [[Cyclone Tracy]], which killed 71 people and destroyed over 70% of the town's buildings, including many old stone buildings such as the Palmerston Town Hall, which could not withstand the lateral forces generated by the strong winds. After the disaster, 30,000 people of a then population of 43,000 were evacuated, in what turned out to be the biggest airlift in Australia's history.<ref name="DCC"/> The town was subsequently rebuilt with newer materials and techniques during the late 1970s by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, led by former [[Brisbane]] Lord Mayor [[Clem Jones]]. A satellite city of [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] was built {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Darwin in the early 1980s.

On 17 September 2003 the [[Adelaide-Darwin railway]] was completed, with the opening of the Alice Springs-Darwin standard gauge line.

== Geography ==
[[File:Darwin skyline.jpg|thumb|Darwin skyline from East Point in 2007]]

Darwin lies in the Northern Territory, on the [[Timor Sea]]. The city proper occupies a low bluff overlooking [[Darwin Harbour]], flanked by Frances Bay to the east and Cullen Bay to the west. The remainder of the city is flat and low-lying, and coastal areas are home to recreational reserves, extensive beaches, and excellent fishing.

Darwin is closer to the capitals of five other countries than to the capital of Australia: Darwin is {{convert|3137|km|mi|0}} away from [[Canberra]]. [[Dili]] (East Timor) is {{convert|656|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Port Moresby]] (Papua New Guinea) is {{convert|1818|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Jakarta]] (Indonesia) is {{convert|2700|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] (Brunei) is {{convert|2607|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Melekeok]] (Palau) is {{convert|2247|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Darwin.

Even Malaysia and Singapore are only slightly farther away at {{convert|3350|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, as is [[Manila]] (Philippines) at {{convert|3206|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Honiara]] (Solomon Islands) at {{convert|3198|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web | title = Northern Territory Sporting Facilities | work=Department of Local Government, Housing and Sport | publisher=Northern Territory Government |url=http://www.sportandrecreation.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/25327/facililties_booklet_web.pdf | accessdate =23 April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], Indonesia, is only {{convert|881|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away from Darwin.

Along with its importance as a gateway to Asia, Darwin also acts as an access point for the [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Arnhem Land]], and northerly islands such as [[Groote Eylandt]] and the [[Tiwi Islands]]. As the largest city in the area, it provides services for these remote settlements.

=== City and suburbs ===
{{Main|List of Darwin suburbs}}
[[File:Map of the Wards and Suburbs of Darwin, Northern Territory.png|280px|thumb|Map of Darwin with suburbs]]
[[File:Mitchell Street Darwin.jpg|thumb|upright|Mitchell Street in Darwin CBD]]
Darwin and its suburbs spread in an approximately triangular shape, with the older south-western suburbs—and the city itself—forming one corner, the newer northern suburbs in another, and the eastern suburbs, progressing towards Palmerston, forming the third.

The older part of Darwin is separated from the newer northern suburbs by [[Darwin International Airport]] and Royal Australian Air Force Base. [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] is a satellite city {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Darwin that was established in the 1980s and is one of the fastest growing municipalities in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmerston.nt.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=292|title=Palmerston Growth|publisher=Palmerston City Council|accessdate=16 December 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> The rural areas of Darwin including [[Howard Springs, Northern Territory|Howard Springs]], [[Humpty Doo, Northern Territory|Humpty Doo]] and [[Berry Springs, Northern Territory|Berry Springs]] are experiencing strong growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futuredarwin.nt.gov.au/development/transport.html|title=Darwin to Palmerston Transport Corridor|quote=Traffic volumes have continued to increase on all road links between Darwin and Palmerston in parallel with the growth of Palmerston and the rural areas...|accessdate=5 February 2008|publisher=[[Government of the Northern Territory]]}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>

Darwin's central business district is bounded by Daly Street in the north-west, McMinn Street in the north-east, Mitchell Street on the south-west and Bennett Street on the south-east. The CBD has been the focus of a number of major projects, including the billion dollar redevelopment of the Stokes Hill wharf waterfront area including a convention centre with seating for 1500 people and approximately {{convert|4000|m2|sqft}} of exhibition space. The development will also include hotels, residential apartments and public space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theterritory.com.au/index.php?menuID=148 |title=Major Projects |publisher=Northern Territory Government |accessdate=15 May 2008}}</ref>

The city's main industrial areas are along the Stuart Highway going towards Palmerston, centred on [[Winnellie, Northern Territory|Winnellie]]. The largest shopping precinct in the area is [[Casuarina Square]].

The most expensive residential areas stand along the coast in suburbs such as [[Larrakeyah, Northern Territory|Larrakeyah]] and [[Brinkin, Northern Territory|Brinkin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.id.com.au/darwin/atlas/default.asp?id=146&pg=19|title=Community Atlas – High Income Households|publisher=Darwin City Council|accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> despite the slight risk these low-lying regions face during cyclones and higher tides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darcity.nt.gov.au/documents/RapidRiskAssessmentFINAL.pdf|title=The Qualitative Rapid Environmental Risk Assessment|publisher=Darwin City Council|accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> The inner northern suburbs of [[Millner, Northern Territory|Millner]] and [[Coconut Grove, Northern Territory|Coconut Grove]] and the eastern suburb of [[Karama, Northern Territory|Karama]] are home to lower-income households, although low-income Territory Housing units are scattered throughout the metropolitan area.<ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Darwin 1824.jpg|thumb|Wet Season storm at night]]
Darwin has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical savannah climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen ''Aw'']])<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = CHAPTER 7: Introduction to the Atmosphere | work=physicalgeography.net |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7v.html | accessdate =15 July 2008 }}</ref> with distinct wet and dry seasons and the average maximum temperature is similar all year round. The [[dry season]] runs from about May to September, during which nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%.<ref name="DarwinAirportAWS">{{cite web | title = Darwin Airport | publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_014015_All.shtml | accessdate =27 September 2008 }}</ref>

There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as {{convert|14|°C|°F}}, but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded. For an exceedingly lengthy 147&nbsp;day period during the 2012 dry season, from 5 May to 29 September, Darwin recorded no precipitation whatsoever. Prolonged periods of no precipitation are common in the dry season in [[Northern Australia]] (particularly in the [[Northern Territory]] and northern regions of [[Western Australia]]) although a no-rainfall event of this length is uncommon.

The wet season is associated with [[tropical cyclone]]s and monsoon rains.<ref>{{cite web | title = Information about Darwin | work=Charles Darwin University |url=http://www.cdu.edu.au/studyabroad/services.html#climate | accessdate =15 July 2008 }}</ref> The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70 percent during the wettest months.<ref name="DarwinAirportAWS"/> It does not rain every day during the wet season, but most days are warm to hot with plentiful cloud cover; January averages under 6 hours of bright sunshine daily. Darwin's highest Bureau of Meteorology verified daily rainfall total is {{convert|367.6|mm}}, which fell when [[2010-11 Australian region cyclone season|Cyclone Carlos]] bore down on the Darwin area on 16 February 2011.<ref>{{cite web | title = Cyclone Carlos bears down on Darwin | publisher=Weatherzone |url=http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/cyclone-carlos-bears-down-on-darwin/16392 | accessdate =16 February 2011 }}</ref> February 2011 was also Darwin's wettest month ever recorded, with {{convert|1110.2|mm}} recorded for the month at the airport.<ref>[http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_014015_All.shtml Climate statistics for Australian locations]. Bom.gov.au.</ref>

The hottest month is November, just before the onset of the main rainy season. Because of its long dry season, Darwin has the most daily average sunshine hours (8.4) of any Australian capital with the most sunshine from April to November. The sun passes directly overhead in mid October and mid February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science.org.au/nova/005/005act02.htm|title=Direct solar energy|publisher=Australian Academy of Science}}</ref>
Climatically Darwin has more in common with Manila than Sydney because it sits well inside the tropical zone.

Darwin occupies one of the most lightning-prone areas in the world. On 31 January 2002 an early-morning [[squall line]] produced over 5,000 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes within a {{convert|60|km|mi}} radius of Darwin alone – about three times the amount of lightning that [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], experiences on average in an entire year.<ref name="GUM"/><ref>

In 2006, the largest ancestry groups in Darwin were, Australian (42,221 or 36.9%), English (29,766 or 26%), Irish (9,561 or 8.3%), Scottish (7,815 or 6.8%), Chinese (3,502 or 3%), Greek (2,828 or 2.4%), and Italian (2,367 or 2%)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&documentproductno=705&documenttype=Details&order=1&tabname=Details&areacode=705&issue=2006&producttype=Census%20Tables&javascript=true&textversion=false&navmapdisplayed=true&breadcrumb=POTLD&&collection=Census&period=2006&productlabel=Ancestry%20(Region)%20by%20Country%20of%20Birth%20of%20Parents&producttype=Census%20Tables&method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&topic=Ancestry&|title=Darwin Ancestry Groups|author=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref>

Darwin's population is notable for the highest proportional population of [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]] of any Australian capital city.<ref name="06census">{{Census 2006 AUS|id=705|name=Darwin (Statistical Division)|accessdate=26 March 2008|quick=on}}</ref> In the 2006 census 10,259 (9.7 per cent) of Darwin's population was Aboriginal.

Darwin's population changed after the Second World War. Darwin, like many other Australian cities, experienced influxes from Europe, with significant numbers of Italians and Greeks during the 1960s and 1970s. Darwin also started to experience an influx from other European countries, which included the Dutch, Germans, and many others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012006?OpenDocument|title=Darwin Significant Migration Groups|author=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> A significant percentage of Darwin's residents are recent immigrants from South East Asia ([[Asian Australian]]s were 9.3% of Darwin's population in 2001).

Darwin's population comprises people from many ethnic backgrounds. The 2006 Census revealed that the most common places of birth for overseas migrants were the United Kingdom (3.4 per cent), New Zealand (2.1 per cent), the Philippines (1.4 per cent) and East Timor (0.9 per cent). 18.3 percent of the city's population was born overseas, which is less than the Australian average of 22%.<ref name="06census"/>

Darwin has a youthful population with an average age of 33 years (compared to the national average of around 37 years)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/7GDAR?opendocument&navpos=220 |title=Youth Population |publisher=Censusdata.abs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> assisted to a large extent by the military presence and the fact that many people opt to retire elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/business/documents/general/Defence_Support_Chapter13_Budget.pdf|title=Updated Darwin Defence RAAF system|publisher=Darwin Defence RAAF Base 2007|accessdate=16 December 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080216115714/http://www.nt.gov.au/business/documents/general/Defence_Support_Chapter13_Budget.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 16 February 2008}}</ref>

The most common languages spoken in Darwin after English are Greek, Italian, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]].<ref name="06census"/>

=== Religion ===
Darwin is essentially a multicultural secular city, however, Christianity has the most adherents in Darwin with 56,613 followers accounting for 49.5 per cent of the population of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&documentproductno=705&documenttype=Details&order=1&tabname=Details&areacode=705&issue=2006&producttype=Census%20Tables&javascript=true&textversion=false&navmapdisplayed=true&breadcrumb=POTLD&&collection=Census&period=2006&productlabel=Religious%20Affiliation%20(broad%20groups)%20by%20Sex&producttype=Census%20Tables&method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&topic=Religion&|title=Religion in Darwin|accessdate=31 March 2008}}</ref> The largest denominations of Christianity are Roman Catholicism (24,538 or 21.5 per cent), [[Anglicanism]] (14,028 or 12.3 per cent) and [[Greek Orthodox]] (2,964 or 2.6 per cent).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&documentproductno=705&documenttype=Details&order=1&tabname=Details&areacode=705&issue=2006&producttype=Census%20Tables&javascript=true&textversion=false&navmapdisplayed=true&breadcrumb=POTLD&&collection=Census&period=2006&productlabel=Religious%20Affiliation%20(full%20classification%20list)%20by%20Sex&producttype=Census%20Tables&method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&topic=Religion&|title=Darwin Religious groups|author=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|accessdate=31 March 2008}}</ref> [[Buddhists]], Muslims, [[Hindus]] and Jews account for 3.2 per cent of Darwin's population. There were 26,695 or 23.3 per cent of people professing no religion.

=== Population growth ===
Darwin is one of the fastest growing capital cities in Australia, with an annual growth rate of 2.6 per cent since the 2006 census. In recent years, the [[City of Palmerston|Palmerston]] and [[Shire of Litchfield|Litchfield]] parts of the Darwin statistical division have recorded the highest growth in population of any [[Northern Territory]] [[Local Government Area]] and by 2016 [[Shire of Litchfield|Litchfield]] could overtake [[City of Palmerston|Palmerston]] as the second largest municipality in metropolitan Darwin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyReleaseDate/AF8693FEEF5896DFCA25741C0077EF91?OpenDocument |title=Darwin Statistical Division population growth|accessdate=31 March 2008|work=ABS}}</ref> It is predicted by 2021 that the combined population of both [[City of Palmerston|Palmerston]] and [[Shire of Litchfield|Litchfield]] would be 101,546 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/6FE818DDDF5292C5CA256A940000A303/$File/32227_1999%20to%202021.pdf|title=Population projections|accessdate=20 April 2008|work=ABS}}</ref>

== Law and government ==
[[File:Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.jpg|thumb|right|Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory]]

The [[City of Darwin|Darwin City Council]] (Incorporated under the Northern Territory Local Government Act 1993) governs the [[City of Darwin]] which takes in the CBD and the suburbs. The Darwin City Council has governed the City of Darwin since 1957. The Darwin City Council consists of 13 elected members, the [[Lord Mayor]] and 12 [[aldermen]].

The City of Darwin electorate is organised into four electoral units or wards. The names of the wards are Chan, Lyons, Richardson, and Waters. The constituents of each ward are directly responsible for electing three [[aldermen]]. Constituents of all wards are directly responsible for electing the Lord Mayor of Darwin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darcity.nt.gov.au/aboutcouncil/elections/elections.htm|title=Darwin City Council – Elections}}</ref> The current mayor is [[Katrina Fong Lim]] after council elections in March 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2012/03/25/295781_ntnews.html |title=Fong Lim wins in landslide |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>

The rest of the Darwin area is divided into [[Local Government Areas of the Northern Territory|2 local government areas]]. One of these is designated as a City, and the second, which is on the city's outer fringe, has the title of Shire. These areas have elected councils which are responsible for functions delegated to them by the [[Northern Territory Government]], such as planning and garbage collection.

The [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory]] convenes in Darwin in the Northern Territory [[Parliament House, Darwin|Parliament House]]. [[Government House, Darwin|Government House]], the official residence of the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]], is located on The Esplanade.

Also located on the Esplanade is the [http://www.supremecourt.nt.gov.au/ Supreme Court of the Northern Territory]. Darwin has a [http://www.nt.gov.au/justice/ntmc Magistrate's Court] also which is located on the corner of Cavenagh and Bennett Streets quite close to the Darwin City Council Chambers.
Darwin's police force are members of the [[Northern Territory Police]] Force. Darwin's Mitchell Street, with its numerous pubs, clubs and other entertainment venues, is policed by the CitySafe Unit. The CitySafe unit was recently credited with reducing violent crime in and around Darwin City.<ref>Jane Bardon (Thu 23 July 2009) [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/23/2634526.htm "Crime statistics show fall in sex assaults"] ABC News</ref> Darwin has a long record of alcohol abuse and violent crime with 6000 assaults in 2009,<ref name="etjaw">Australian city of Darwin named 'broken jaw capital of the world', [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6945648/Australian-city-of-Darwin-named-broken-jaw-capital-of-the-world.html Daily Telegraph], 7 January 2010</ref> of which 350 resulted in broken jaws and noses – more than anywhere else in the world, according to the Royal Darwin Hospital.<ref name="etjaw"/>

== Economy ==
[[File:Darwin CBD-2005.jpg|thumb|Darwin CBD (Central Business District), circa 2005]]
The two largest economic sectors are [[mining]] and [[tourism]]. Mining and energy industry production exceeds $2.5&nbsp;billion per annum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nt.gov.au/dpifm/Minerals_Energy/index.cfm?header=About%20Minerals%20and%20Energy |title=About the Minerals and Energy Group|publisher=Department of Primary Industry, Fisheries and Mines}}</ref> The most important mineral resources are gold, zinc and [[bauxite]], along with [[manganese]] and many others. The energy production is mostly off shore with [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] from the [[Timor Sea]], although there are significant [[uranium]] deposits near Darwin. Tourism employs 8% of Darwin residents, and is expected to grow as domestic and international tourists are now spending time in Darwin during the [[wet season|Wet]] and [[dry season|Dry]] seasons. Federal spending is a major contributor to the local economy as well.

The military presence that is maintained both within Darwin, and the wider Northern Territory, is a substantial source of employment. The continued involvement of the [[Australian Army]] in the stabilisation of [[East Timor]] has swelled the military population of Darwin to over 11,000 individuals as of 2001. There is also a substantial [[United Nations]] presence in Darwin, since Darwin serves as the staging center for UN workers and contractors en route to nearby East Timor.

Darwin's importance as a port is expected to grow, due to the increased exploitation of petroleum in the nearby Timor Sea, and to the completion of the railway link and continued expansion in trade with [[Asia]].

During 2005, a number of major construction projects started in Darwin. One is the redevelopment of the Wharf Precinct, which includes a large convention and exhibition centre, apartment housing including [[Outrigger Pandanas]] and [[Evolution on Gardiner]], retail and entertainment outlets including a large wave pool and safe swimming lagoon. The [[Chinatown]] project has also started with plans to construct multi-level carparks, Chinese-themed retail and dining outlets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/waterfront/news/newsletter/2005/pdf/200504Transformation.pdf |title=Darwin City Waterfront|accessdate=13 May 2007|work=Northern Territory Government |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070604233555/http://www.nt.gov.au/waterfront/news/newsletter/2005/pdf/200504Transformation.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 4 June 2007}}</ref>

Swimming in the sea during the months of October–May should be avoided due to the presence of deadly [[box jellyfish]], known locally as stingers.

[[Saltwater crocodile]]s are very common in all waterways surrounding Darwin and are even occasionally found swimming in Darwin Harbour and on local beaches.

Fishing is one of the recreations of Darwin locals. Visitors from around the world flock to Darwin aiming to catch the prized [[barramundi]], an iconic fish for the region. The [[Mary River (Northern Territory)|Mary River]], [[Daly River]], South and [[East Alligator River]] are just a few of the water bodies where the barramundi thrive.

Blue-water fishing is also available off the coast of Darwin; [[Spanish mackerel]], Black Jewfish, [[queenfish]], snapper and other varieties are all found in the area and accessible in a day trip from Darwin. [[Lake Alexander]] is a man-made lake which is generally considered safe, bar a freak jellyfish outbreak in 2003,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2003/08/26/932403.htm|title=Jellyfish infestation closes Darwin's Lake Alexander|publisher=ABC News|date=26 August 2003}}</ref> and is located at East Point Reserve.

== Aviation history ==
[[File:Darwin 1921.jpg|thumb|Darwin Aviation Heritage Centre – 1st Ultralight – Hover Bird]]
Darwin has played host to many of aviation's early pioneers. On 10 December 1919 Captain [[Ross Macpherson Smith|Ross Smith]] and his crew landed in Darwin and won a £10,000 Prize from the Australian Government for completing the first flight from London to Australia in under thirty days. Smith and his Crew flew a [[Vickers Vimy]], G-EAOU and landed on an airstrip that has now become Ross Smith Avenue.

Other aviation pioneers include [[Amy Johnson]], [[Amelia Earhart]], Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and [[Bert Hinkler]]. The original QANTAS Empire Airways Ltd Hangar, part of the original Darwin Civil Aerodrome in Parap, is now a museum and still bears scars from the [[bombing of Darwin]] during World War II.<ref>[http://www.enjoy-darwin.com/qantas-australia.html QANTAS hangar]. Enjoy-darwin.com.</ref>

Darwin was home to Australian and US pilots during the war, with air strips being built in and around Darwin. Today Darwin provides a staging ground for [[military exercise]]s.

Darwin was a compulsory stop over/check point in the London to Melbourne Centenary Air Race in 1934. The official name of the race was the [[MacRobertson Air Race]]. Winners of the great race were [[Tom Campbell Black]] and [[C. W. A. Scott]].

The following is an excerpt from [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], 29 October 1934, Volume XXIV, Number 18.

{{quotation|Third Day. Biggest sensation of the race came just before dawn on the third day, when burly Lieutenant Scott and dapper [[Flight Lieutenant|Captain]] Black flew their scarlet [[De Havilland DH.88|Comet]] into Darwin. They had covered the last 300 miles over water on one motor, risked death landing on a field made soggy by the first rain in seven months. Said sandy-haired Lieutenant Scott: "We've had a devil of a trip." But they had flown 9000 miles in two days, had broken the England to Australia record of 162 hr. in the unbelievable time of 52hr. 33 min., were only 2000 miles from their goal at Melbourne.}}

The Australian Aviation Heritage Centre is located approximately {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the City centre on the Stuart Highway and is one of only two places outside the United States where a B52 bomber (on permanent loan from the United States Air Force) is on public display.<ref>{{cite web

== US military presence ==
{{see also|Quadrilateral Security Dialogue}}
On 16 November 2011, Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] and President [[Barack Obama]] announced that the United States would station troops in Australia for the first time since World War II.

China and [[Indonesia]] have expressed concern about the decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3ddd6756-102a-11e1-8211-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz1dsyhRbP6 |title=US to base 2,500 troops in Australia |date=16 November 2011|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-17/china-indonesia-wary-of-us-troops-in-darwin/3675866 |title=China, Indonesia wary of U.S. troops in Darwin |date=17 November 2011|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref> Some analysts have argued that an expanded U.S. presence could pose a threat to security, a view defence analyst Paul Dibb rejects, noting the deterrent effect of an offshore U.S. military presence in the [[1999 East Timorese crisis]] which dissuaded Indonesia from directly attacking Australian peacekeepers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/us-build-up-no-threat-to-peace/story-e6frgd0x-1226194972352|title=US Build-up no threat to peace|date=15 November 2011|author=Paul Dibb|newspaper=The Australian}}</ref>
