The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous peoples]] including the [[Muisca]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], and [[Tairona]]. The Spanish arrived in 1499 and initiated a period of [[Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations|conquest and colonization]] ultimately creating the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], with its capital at [[Bogotá]].<ref name="LABLAA6">{{cite web|author=Nicolás del Castillo Mathieu|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/marzo1992/marzo3.htm|title=La primera vision de las costas Colombianas, Repaso de Historia|work=Revista Credencial|month=March|year=1992|accessdate=29 February 2008|language=Spanish}}</ref> Independence from Spain was won in 1819, but by 1830 "[[Gran Colombia]]" had collapsed with the secession of Venezuela and Ecuador.

Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America, and an important promoter of the Pan American organizations, initially through the [[Congress of Panama]] and later as founder of the [[Organization of American States]]. Colombia was engulfed in the [[Leticia Incident|Year-Long War with Peru]] over a territorial dispute and entered the [[Korean War]] as an ally of South Korea. Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] [[Low intensity conflict|low-intensity]] armed conflict. [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|The conflict]] escalated in the 1990s, but since 2000 the conflict has decreased considerably.<ref name="CIAWFB"/>

Colombia is very ethnically diverse, and the interaction between descendants of the original [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|native]] inhabitants, [[Spanish people|Spanish]] colonists, [[Afro-Colombian|Africans]] originally brought to the country as slaves, and 20th-century immigrants from [[European ethnic groups|Europe]] and the [[Arab diaspora in Colombia|Middle East]], has produced a rich cultural heritage.<ref name="Familia y Comunidad">[http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/familia/1597/propertyvalue-33415.html Familia y Comunidad – Ritmos de Colombia]. Colombiaaprende.edu.co. Retrieved on 14 May 2012.</ref> This has also been influenced by Colombia's varied geography, and the imposing landscape of the country has resulted in the development of very strong regional identities, in many cases stronger than the national. The majority of the urban centres are located in the highlands of the [[Andes|Andes mountains]], but Colombian territory also encompasses [[Amazon rainforest]], [[Los Llanos (South America)|tropical grassland]] and both Caribbean and Pacific coastlines.

Ecologically, Colombia is one of the world's 17 [[megadiverse countries]], and is considered the most megadiverse per square kilometer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telepolis.com/cgi-bin/web/DISTRITODOCVIEW?url=/1604/doc/Parquesnaturales/paisajes.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090320222757/http://www.telepolis.com/cgi-bin/web/DISTRITODOCVIEW?url=/1604/doc/Parquesnaturales/paisajes.htm |archivedate=2009-03-20 |title= Paisajes naturales de Colombia |publisher=Telepolis.com |accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref><ref>Luis Fernando Potes.

== Etymology ==
The name "Colombia" is derived from the last name of [[Christopher Columbus]] (Italian: ''Cristoforo Colombo''; Spanish: ''Cristóbal Colón''). It was conceived by the Venezuelan revolutionary [[Francisco de Miranda]] as a reference to all the New World, but especially to those under the Spanish and Portuguese rule. The name was later adopted by the [[Greater Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] of 1819, formed out of the territories of the old [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (modern-day Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, and northwest Brazil).<ref name="LABLAA5">{{cite web|author=Carlos Restrepo Piedrahita|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/febrero1992/febrero2.htm|title=El nombre "Colombia", El único país que lleva el nombre del Descubrimiento|work=Revista Credencial|month=February|year=1992|accessdate=29 February 2008|language=Spanish}}</ref>

In 1835, when Venezuela and Ecuador parted ways, the [[Cundinamarca Province|Cundinamarca]] region that remained became a new country – the [[Republic of New Granada]]. In 1858 the New Granada officially changed its name to the [[Granadine Confederation]], then in 1863 the [[United States of Colombia]], before finally adopting its present name – the Republic of Colombia – in 1886.<ref name="LABLAA5"/>

To refer to the country, the Colombian government uses the terms ''Colombia'' and ''República de Colombia''.

Due to its geographical location, the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of populations between [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Caribbean]], the [[Andes]] and the [[Amazonia|Amazon]]. The oldest archaeological finds are from sites at Monsú and Pubenza, dating from about 20,000 BC. Other vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in regions like [[El Abra]] between [[Tocancipá]], [[Zipaquirá]] and Tequendama in [[Cundinamarca Department (1820)|Cundinamarca]]. These sites correspond to the [[Paleoindian]] period. In Puerto Hormiga, traces of the archaic period have been found, including the oldest pottery discovered in America, dating from about 3000 BC.

Approximately 10,000 BC, the territory of what is now Colombia was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous people]] including the [[Muisca]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], and [[Tairona]]. [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies existed near present-day Bogotá (at "El Abra" and "Tequendama") which traded with one another and with cultures living in the [[Magdalena River]] Valley.<ref>Van der Hammen, T. and Correal, G. 1978: "Prehistoric man on the Sabana de Bogotá: data for an ecological prehistory"; Paleography, Paleoclimatology, Paleoecology 25:179–190</ref> Beginning in the 1st millennium BC, groups of [[Amerindian]]s developed the political system of "[[cacicazgo]]s" with a pyramidal structure of power headed by [[Cacique Nutibara Bloc|caciques]]. The Muiscas inhabited mainly the area of what is now the [[Departments of Colombia|Departments]] of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] and [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] high plateau (''[[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]''). They farmed maize, potato, quinoa and cotton, and traded worked gold, emeralds, blankets, ceramic handicrafts, coca and salt with neighboring nations. The Taironas inhabited northern Colombia in the isolated [[Andes]] mountain range of [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]].<ref>Broadbent, Sylvia 1965: Los Chibchas: organización socio-política.

=== Spanish rule ===
[[File:Ataque Cartagena de Indias.jpg|thumb|Attack of the British army commanded by the Vice-Admiral [[Edward Vernon]] on Cartagena de Indias. [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|The battle]] resulted in a major defeat for the British Navy and Army Navy during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]].]]
Spanish explorers, led by [[Rodrigo de Bastidas]], made the first exploration of the Caribbean littoral in 1500. [[Christopher Columbus]] navigated near the Caribbean in 1502. In 1508, [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] started the conquest of the territory through the region of Urabá. In 1513, he was the first European to see the Pacific Ocean, which he called ''Mar del Sur'' (or "Sea of the South") and which in fact would bring the Spaniards to Peru and Chile.

[[Alonso de Ojeda]] (who had sailed with Columbus) reached the [[Guajira Peninsula]] in 1500. Santa Marta was founded in 1525, and Cartagena in 1533. Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada led an expedition to the interior in 1535, and founded the "New City of Granada", the name of which soon changed to "Santa Fé". Two other notable journeys by Spaniards to the interior took place in the same period. [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]], conqueror of Quito, traveled north and founded Cali, in 1536, and Popayán, in 1537; Nicolas Federman crossed the Llanos Orientales and went over the Eastern Cordillera.<ref>Simons, Geoff. ''Colombia: A Brutal History'' (London: Saqi, 2004), p. 19 ISBN 0-86356-758-4.</ref>

The Caribbean people, indigenous to Colombia, experienced a reduction in population due to conquest by the Spanish as well as European-carried diseases such as [[smallpox]], to which they had no immunity.<ref name="smallpox">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html |title=The Story Of&nbsp;... Smallpox – and other Deadly Eurasian Germs |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref> In the 16th century, Europeans began to bring slaves from Africa.

The Spanish settled along the north coast of today's Colombia as early as the 16th century, but their first permanent settlement, at Santa Marta, was not established until 1525. In 1549, the institution of the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] in Santa Fe de [[Bogotá]] gave that city the status of capital of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], which comprised in large part what is now territory of Colombia.

With the risk that the land was deserted, the Spanish Crown sold properties to the governors, conquerors and their descendants creating large farms and possession of mines. Slaves were introduced as labor. Also to protect the indigenous population decimated, and [[Indian reservations]] were created. The repopulation was achieved by allowing colonization by farmers and their families who came from Spain. With this began the colonial period. New Granada was ruled by the [[Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogotá]], but important decisions were taken to the colony from Spain by the [[Council of the Indies]].

A royal decree of 1713 approved the legality of [[Palenque de San Basilio]] founded by runaway slaves from the 15th century, slaves had fled and sought refuge in the jungles of the Caribbean coast. The Spanish forces could not tolerate them and ended up submitting, thereby giving rise to the first free place in the Americas. Its main leader was [[Benkos Bioho|Benkos Biohó]], born in the region Bioho, [[Guinea Bissau]], West Africa. Palenque de San Basilio was declared in 2005 as a "Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity" by [[UNESCO]].<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/11lac_uk.htm The Cultural Space of Palenque de San Basilio]. Unesco.org. Retrieved on 14 May 2012.</ref>

In 1717 the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] was originally created, and then it was temporarily removed, to finally be reestablished in 1739. The Viceroyalty had Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalties of New Spain]] or [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] and correspond mainly to today's Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama. So, Bogotá became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World, along with [[Lima]] and [[Mexico City]], though it remained somewhat backward compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways.

The 18th-century priest, botanist and mathematician [[José Celestino Mutis]] (1732–1808), was delegated by the viceroy [[Antonio Caballero y Góngora]] to conduct an inventory of the nature of the New Granada. This became known as the [[Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada]] which classified plants, wildlife and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of Santa Fe de Bogotá. On 15 August 1801 the Prussian scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] reached [[Fontibón]] where he joined Mutis in New Granada expedition to Quito.

===Independence===
{{Main|Colombian Declaration of Independence}}
[[File:Batalla de Boyaca de Martin Tovar y Tovar.jpg|thumb|The [[battle of Boyacá]] was the decisive battle which would ensure the success of the [[Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada|liberation campaign of New Granada]].]]
Since the beginning of the periods of conquest and colonization, there were several rebel movements under Spanish rule, most of them were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation. The last one which sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around 1810, following the independence of St. Domingue (present-day Haiti) in 1804, which provided a non-negligible degree of support to the eventual leaders of this rebellion: [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]].

A movement initiated by [[Antonio Nariño]], who opposed Spanish centralism and led the opposition against the [[viceroyalty]], led to the independence of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in November 1811, and the formation of two independent governments which fought a civil war – a period known as [[La Patria Boba]]. The following year Nariño proclaimed the [[United Provinces of New Granada]], headed by Camilo Torres Tenorio. Despite the successes of the rebellion, the emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the liberators (federalism and centralism) gave rise to an internal clash which contributed to the reconquest of territory by the Spanish. The viceroyalty was restored under the command of Juan de Samano, whose regime punished those who participated in the uprisings. The retribution stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened Spain, made possible a successful rebellion led by the Venezuelan-born Simón Bolívar, who finally proclaimed independence in 1819. The pro-Spanish resistance was finally defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela.

The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the [[Gran Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] organized as a union of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela (Panama was then an integral part of Colombia). The Congress of Cúcuta in 1821 adopted a constitution for the new Republic. Simón Bolívar became the first [[President of Colombia]], and Francisco de Paula Santander was made [[Vice President of Colombia|Vice President]]. However, the new republic was unstable and ended with the rupture of Venezuela in 1829, followed by Ecuador in 1830.

[[File:Mapa Gran Colombia (1824-1830).svg|thumb|The [[Gran Colombia]].]]
Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America, and the Liberal and Conservative parties, founded in 1848 and 1849 respectively, are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas. [[Slavery]] was abolished in Colombia in 1851.<ref>{{cite book | last = Aguilera| first = Miguel| title = La Legislacion y el derecho en Colombia| series = Historia extensa de Colombia| volume = 14| publisher = Lemer | year = 1965| location = Bogota| pages = 428–442}}</ref>

Internal political and territorial divisions led to the secession of Venezuela and Quito (today's Ecuador) in 1830. The so-called "[[Cundinamarca Department (1824)|Department of Cundinamarca]]" adopted the name "[[Republic of the New Granada|Nueva Granada]]", which it kept until 1856 when it became the "Confederación Granadina" ([[Granadine Confederation]]). After a [[Colombian Civil War (1860–1862)|two-year civil war]] in 1863, the "[[United States of Colombia]]" was created, lasting until 1886, when the country finally became known as the Republic of Colombia. Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces, occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars, the most significant being the [[Thousand Days' War]] (1899–1902).

===20th century===
The United States of America's intentions to influence the area (especially the [[Panama Canal]] construction and control) led to the separation of the Department of Panama in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation. The United States paid Colombia $25,000,000 in 1921, seven years after completion of the canal, for redress of President Roosevelt's role in the creation of Panama, and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the [[Thomson–Urrutia Treaty]].
Colombia was engulfed in the [[Leticia Incident|Year-Long War with Peru]] over a territorial dispute involving the [[Amazonas department]] and its capital [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]].

[[File:Bogotazo.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bogotazo]] in 1948]]
Soon after, Colombia achieved some degree of political stability, which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, a period known as ''[[La Violencia]]'' ("The Violence"). Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties, which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal]] presidential candidate [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]] on 9 April 1948. The ensuing riots in Bogotá, known as [[El Bogotazo]], spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 Colombians.<ref name="Encarta">{{cite web|author =Charles Bergquist and David J.

Colombia entered the [[Korean War]] when [[Laureano Gómez]] was elected as President. Colombia was the only Latin American country to join the war in a direct military role. As an ally of the United States, Colombia’s mission was to help win the war effort and broker a lasting peace on the Asian peninsula. Particularly important was the heroic resistance of the Colombian troops at [[Battle of Old Baldy|Old Baldy]].<ref name="Colombia’s legacy with Korea">{{cite web|url= http://thecitypaperbogota.com/features/colombias-legacy-with-korea/|publisher=thecitypaperbogota.com|title= Colombia’s legacy with Korea|date= 2 April 2013}}</ref>

From 1953 to 1964 the violence between the two political parties decreased first when [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] deposed the President of Colombia in a [[coup d'état]] and negotiated with the guerrillas, and then under the [[military junta]] of General [[Gabriel París Gordillo]].

After Rojas' deposition, the [[Colombian Conservative Party]] and Colombian Liberal Party agreed to create the "[[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]]", a coalition which would jointly govern the country. Under the deal, the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices. The National Front ended "La Violencia", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress. In the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the [[FARC]], [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]], [[Popular Liberation Army|EPL]], [[Movimiento Armado Quintin Lame|MAQL]] and [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] to fight the government and political apparatus.

Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] [[Low intensity conflict|low-intensity]] armed conflict between the [[Military Forces of Colombia|government forces]], [[Guerrilla movements in Colombia|left-wing guerrilla groups]] and [[Paramilitarism in Colombia|right-wing paramilitaries]].

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Colombia}}
{{See also|Geology of Colombia|List of national parks of Colombia|List of rivers in Colombia}}
[[File:Volcan Huila 9-12-2008 (1).jpg|thumb|[[Nevado del Huila]]]]
The geography of Colombia is characterized by its six main [[natural region]]s that present their own unique characteristics, from the [[Andes|Andes mountain range]] region shared with Ecuador and Venezuela; the [[Pacific Coast|Pacific coastal region]] shared with Panama and Ecuador; the Caribbean coastal region shared with Venezuela and Panama; the ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]'' (plains) shared with Venezuela; to the [[Amazon Rainforest]] region shared with Venezuela, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador.

Colombia is bordered to the east by Venezuela and Brazil; to the south by Ecuador and Peru; to the north by Panama and the Caribbean Sea; and to the west by Ecuador and the Pacific Ocean. Including its Caribbean islands, it lies between latitudes [[14th parallel north|14°N]] and [[5th parallel south|5°S]], and longitudes [[66th meridian west|66°]] and [[82nd meridian west|82°W]]

Part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]], a region of the world subject to earthquakes and [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], Colombia is dominated by the Andes (which contain the majority of the country's urban centres). Beyond the [[Colombian Massif]] (in the south-western departments of [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] and [[Nariño Department|Nariño]]) these are divided into three branches known as ''cordilleras'' (mountain ranges): the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Cordillera Occidental]], running adjacent to the Pacific coast and including the city of [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]]; the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central]], running between the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] and [[Magdalena River|Magdalena]] river valleys (to the west and east respectively) and including the cities of [[Medellín]], [[Manizales]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]] and [[Armenia, Quindío|Armenia]]; and the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]], extending north east to the [[Guajira Peninsula]] and including Bogotá, [[Bucaramanga]] and [[Cúcuta]].

East of the Andes lies the [[savanna]] of the ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]'', part of the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River basin]], and, in the far south east, the [[jungle]] of the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Together these lowlands comprise over half Colombia's territory, but they contain less than 3% of the population. To the north the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean coast]], home to 20% of the population and the location of the major port cities of [[Barranquilla]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], generally consists of low-lying plains, but it also contains the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountain range, which includes the country's tallest peaks ([[Pico Cristóbal Colón]] and [[Pico Simón Bolívar]]), and the [[La Guajira Desert]]. By contrast the narrow and discontinuous [[Pacific Region of Colombia|Pacific coastal lowlands]], backed by the [[Baudó Mountains|Serranía de Baudó]] mountains, are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific port is [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]].

The main rivers of Colombia are [[Magdalena River|Magdalena]], [[Cauca River|Cauca]], [[Guaviare Department|Guaviare]], and [[Caquetá River|Caquetá]]. Colombia has four main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin. The [[Orinoco]] and [[Amazon River|Amazon]] Rivers mark limits with Colombia to Venezuela and Peru respectively.<ref>[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/ayudadetareas/geografia/geo111.htm Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango].

{{Main|Climate of Colombia}}
Colombians customarily describe their country in terms of the climatic zones. Below {{convert|900|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation is the [[tierra caliente]] (hot land), where temperatures vary between {{convert|24|and|38|°C|°F|1}}. About 86% of the country's total area lies in the tierra caliente.

The most productive land and the majority of the population can be found in the [[tierra templada]] (temperate land, between {{convert|900|and|1980|m|ft|0|sp=us}}), which provide the best conditions for the country's [[Colombian coffee|coffee]] growers, and the [[tierra fría]] (cold land, {{convert|1980|and|3500|m|ft|0|sp=us}}), where wheat and potatoes dominate.

In the tierra fría mean temperatures range between {{convert|10|and|19|°C|°F|1}}. Beyond the tierra fría lie the alpine conditions of the forested zone and then the treeless grasslands of the [[páramo]]s. Above {{convert|4500|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, where temperatures are below freezing, is the [[tierra helada]], a zone of permanent snow and ice.

== Government and politics==
{{Main|Government of Colombia}}
{{See also|Colombian Constitution of 1991}}
[[File:Casa presidencial de Bogotá.jpg|thumb|left|[[Casa de Nariño]], is the official home and principal workplace of the [[President of Colombia]].]]
The government of Colombia takes place within the framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic as established in the Constitution of 1991. In accordance with the principle of [[separation of powers]], government is divided into three branches: the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch.

As the head of the executive branch, the [[President of Colombia]] serves as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], followed by the [[Vice President of Colombia|Vice President]] and the [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of Colombia|Council of Ministers]]. The president is elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms and is limited to a maximum of two such terms (increased from one in 2005). At the provincial level executive power is vested in [[List of Colombian Department Governors|department governors]], [[municipalities of Colombia|municipal mayors]] and local administrators for smaller administrative subdivisions, such as ''corregidores'' or ''[[Corregimientos of Colombia|corregimientos]]''.

The legislative branch of government is represented nationally by the [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]], a bicameral institution comprising a 166-seat [[Chamber of Representatives of Colombia|Chamber of Representatives]] and a 102-seat [[Senate of Colombia|Senate]]. The Senate is elected nationally and the Chamber of Representatives by every region and minority groups.<ref>Colombian Constitution. 1991</ref> Members of both houses are elected to serve four-year terms two months before the president, also by popular vote. At the provincial level the legislative branch is represented by [[List of Colombian Department Assemblies|department assemblies]] and municipal councils. All regional elections are held one year and five months after the presidential election.

[[File:Nuevopalaciodejusticia.JPG|thumb|Colombia's Palace of Justice.]]
The judicial branch is headed by the [[Supreme Court of Colombia|Supreme Court]], consisting of 23 judges divided into three chambers (Penal, Civil and Agrarian, and Labour). The judicial branch also includes the [[Council of State of Colombia|Council of State]], which has special responsibility for [[administrative law]] and also provides legal advice to the executive, the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]], responsible for assuring the integrity of the Colombian constitution, and the [[Superior Council of Judicature]], responsible for auditing the judicial branch. Colombia operates a system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], which since 2005 has been applied through an [[adversarial system]].

Despite a number of controversies, most notably the ongoing parapolitics scandal, dramatic improvements in security and continued strong economic performance have ensured that former President Uribe remained popular among Colombian people, with his approval rating peaking at 85%, according to a poll in July 2008.<ref name="Uribe Popularity">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN06348039 |title=Reuters, Popularity of Colombia's Uribe soars after rescue |agency=Reuters  |date= 6 July 2008|accessdate=16 May 2010 |author=Hugh Bronstein}}</ref> However, having served two terms, he was constitutionally barred from seeking re-election in 2010.

Within Latin America, Colombia's armed forces are the third-largest, behind Brazil and Mexico, and it spends the second-highest proportion of GDP after Chile.

The Colombian military is divided into three branches: the [[National Army of Colombia]]; the [[Colombian Air Force]]; and the [[Colombian National Armada]]. The National Police functions as a [[gendarmerie]], operating independently from the military as the law enforcement agency for the entire country. Each of these operates with their own intelligence apparatus separate from the national intelligence agency, the [[Administrative Department of Security]].

The National Army is formed by divisions, regiments and special units; the National Armada by the [[Colombian Naval Infantry]], the Naval Force of the Caribbean, the Naval Force of the Pacific, the Naval Force of the South, [[Colombian Navy|Colombia Coast Guards]], [[Colombian Navy|Naval Aviation]] and the [[Military Forces of Colombia|Specific Command of San Andres y Providencia]]; and the Air Force by 13 air units. The National Police has a presence in all municipalities.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Departments of Colombia|Municipalities of Colombia}}
{{See also|List of cities in Colombia|Corregimientos of Colombia}}
Colombia is divided into 32 [[Departments of Colombia|departments]] and one [[Bogotá Capital District|capital district]], which is treated as a department (Bogotá also serves as the capital of the [[Cundinamarca Department|department of Cundinamarca]]). Departments are subdivided into [[Municipalities of Colombia|municipalities]], each of which is assigned a municipal seat, and municipalities are in turn subdivided into ''[[Corregimientos of Colombia|corregimientos]]''. Each department has a local government with a governor and assembly directly elected to four-year terms. Each municipality is headed by a mayor and council, and each ''corregimiento'' by an elected ''corregidor'', or local leader.

In addition to the capital nine other cities have been designated [[Districts of Colombia|districts]] (in effect special municipalities), on the basis of special distinguishing features. These are [[Barranquilla]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Santa Marta]], [[Cúcuta]], [[Popayán]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Tunja]], [[Turbo, Colombia|Turbo]], [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]] and [[Tumaco]]. Some departments have local administrative subdivisions, where towns have a large concentration of population and municipalities are near each other (for example in Antioquia and Cundinamarca). Where departments have a low population (for example Amazonas, Vaupés and Vichada), special administrative divisions are employed, such as "department ''corregimientos''", which are a hybrid of a municipality and a ''corregimiento''.

{{Main|Economy of Colombia}}
{{See also|Agriculture in Colombia}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Colombia.jpeg|thumb|190px|Graphical depiction of Colombia's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]
Historically an agrarian economy, Colombia urbanised rapidly in the 20th century, by the end of which just 22.7% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, generating just 11.5% of GDP; 18.7% of the workforce are employed in industry and 58.5% in services, responsible for 36% and 52.5% of GDP respectively.<ref name="CIAWFB"/>

Colombia's [[market economy]] grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a [[recession]] in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the [[Great Depression]]), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 8.2% in 2007, one of the [[List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate|highest rates of growth]] in Latin America.<ref name="BANKREP"/> According to [[International Monetary Fund]] estimates, in 2012 Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$500&nbsp;billion ([[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|28th in the world]] and third in South America).

[[Government spending]] has stabilized at about 29 percent of total domestic output. Public debt remains below 35 percent of GDP.

It is also home to the second-largest number of Spanish speakers in the world after Mexico. At the beginning of the 20th century, Colombia's population was approximately 4&nbsp;million.<ref>"[http://countrystudies.us/colombia/35.htm Colombia – Population]". [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].</ref> The population increased at a rate of 1.9% between 1975 and 2005, predicted to drop to 1.2% over the next decade. Colombia is projected to have a population of 50.7&nbsp;million by 2015. These trends are reflected in the country's age profile. In 2005 over 30% of the population was under 15 years old, compared to just 5.1% aged 65 and over.

The population is concentrated in the [[Andean Region of Colombia|Andean highlands]] and along the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean coast]]. The nine eastern lowland departments, comprising about 54% of Colombia's area, have less than 3% of the population and a density of less than one person per square kilometer (two persons per square mile). Traditionally a rural society, [[Urbanization|movement to urban areas]] was very heavy in the mid-20th century, and Colombia is now one of the most urbanized countries in Latin America. The urban population increased from 31% of the total in 1938 to 60% in 1975, and by 2005 the figure stood at 72.7%.<ref name="Country Study">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/colombia/36.htm |title=Colombia: A Country Study |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref> The population of Bogotá alone has increased from just over 300,000 in 1938 to approximately 8 million today. In total seventy one cities now have populations of 100,000 or more (2013). As of 2010 Colombia has the world's largest populations of [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs), estimated to be up to 4.5&nbsp;million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/12808-colombia-has-most-displaced-in-the-world.html |title=Colombia has most displaced in world: UN |publisher=Colombia Reports |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/EGUA-7RQN5C?OpenDocument Number of internally displaced people remains stable at 26 million].

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Colombia}}
More than 99.2% of Colombians speak the [[Spanish language]]; also 65 [[Amerindian languages]], 2 [[Creole languages]] and the [[romani language]] are spoken in the country. [[English language|English]] has official status in the San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina Islands.<ref name="lenguas indígenas">{{cite web |url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/antropologia/lengua/clas2.htm |title= Languages of Colombia|publisher = banrepcultural.org|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="Languages of Colombia">{{cite web |url= http://www.ambafrance-co.org/Jon-Landaburu-Especialista-de-las |title= Jon Landaburu, Especialista de las lenguas de Colombia|publisher = ambafrance-co.org|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="MapofthelanguagesofColombia">{{cite web |url= http://www.lenguasdecolombia.gov.co/mapalenguas/inicio.swf |title= Map of the languages of Colombia|publisher = lenguasdecolombia.gov.co|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013}}</ref>

The overwhelming majority of Colombians speak Spanish (see also [[Colombian Spanish]]), but in total 101 languages are listed for Colombia in the [[Ethnologue]] database. The specific number of spoken languages varies slightly since some authors consider as different languages what others consider are varieties or dialects of the same language, the best estimates recorded that 70 languages are spoken in the country today. Most of these belong to the [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha]]n, [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]] and [[Cariban languages|Carib]]an language families.

=== Ethnic groups ===
[[File:Razascolombianas.jpg|thumb|left|Colombia is ethnically diverse]]
{{main|Race and ethnicity in Colombia}}
The descendants of the original native inhabitants, Spanish colonists, African people originally brought to the country as slaves and 20th-century [[European ethnic groups|immigrants from Europe]] and the Middle East have produced a diverse  cultural heritage in Colombia.<ref name="Familia y Comunidad"/> The demographic distribution reflects a pattern is influenced by colonial history. Whites tend to live mainly in urban centers, particularly in [[Bogotá]] and the burgeoning highland cities. The populations of the major cities also include mestizos. [[Mestizo Colombian|Mestizo]] ''campesinos'' (people living in rural areas) also live in the Andean highlands where the Spanish conquerors mixed with the women of Amerindian [[chiefdoms]]. Mestizos include artisans and small tradesmen that have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent decades.<ref>Bushnell & Hudson, pp. 87–88.</ref>

According to the 2005 census, 49% of Colombia's population is [[Mestizo Colombian|Mestizo]] or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry. Approximately 37% is of [[White Colombian|European]] ancestry (predominantly Spanish, and a part of [[Italians|Italian]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], and [[Germans|German]]). About 10.6% is of [[Afro-Colombian|African]] ancestry. [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|Indigenous Amerindians]] comprise 3.4% of the population.<ref name="The Society and Its Environment"/> The 2005 census reported that the "non-ethnic population", consisting of whites and [[mestizos]] (those of mixed white European and Amerindian ancestry), constituted 86% of the national population.<ref name="The Society and Its Environment"/>

The [[National Indigenous Organization of Colombia|Organización Nacional Indígena de Colombia]] (ONIC), founded at the first National Indigenous Congress in 1982, is an organization representing the indigenous peoples of Colombia, who comprise some 800,000 people – roughly 2% of the population. In 1991, Colombia signed and ratified the current international law concerning indigenous peoples, [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989]].

[[African people|Black Africans]] were brought as [[Slavery|slaves]], mostly to the coastal lowlands, beginning early in the 16th century and continuing into the 19th century. Large Afro-Colombian communities are found today on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. The population of the [[Chocó Department|department of Chocó]], running along the northern portion of Colombia's Pacific coast, is over 80% black.<ref name="Grupos Étnicos">{{es icon}} [http://www.dane.gov.co/censo/files/presentaciones/grupos_etnicos.pdf Colombia una Los grupos étnicos colombianos]</ref> A number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and, in smaller numbers, [[Poles]], [[Lithuanians]], [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Croats]] during and after the Second World War.

Many immigrant communities have settled on the Caribbean coast, in particular recent immigrants from the Middle East. Barranquilla (the largest city of the Colombian Caribbean) and other Caribbean cities have the largest populations of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], and other [[Arabs]], [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Romanies]]. There are also important communities of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]. There is a major migration trend of Venezuelans, due to the political and economic situation in Venezuela.<ref>[http://revistas.utadeo.edu.co/index.php/RAI/article/view/84/88 Análisis de la migración venezolana a Colombia durante el gobierno de Hugo Chávez (1999–2011).

The [[National Administrative Department of Statistics]] (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies, more than 95% of the population adheres to [[Christianity]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/country/?CountryID=78|title=Religious Intelligence&nbsp; – Country Profile: Colombia|accessdate=3 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927194326/http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/country/?CountryID=78 |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}</ref> the vast majority of which (between 81% and 90%) are [[Roman Catholic]]. About 1% of Colombians adhere to [[animism|indigenous religions]] and under 1% to [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].

Like the rest of Latin America, Colombia is seeing a continuous increase of Protestant adherents, most of them being converts from [[Catholicism]] to [[Protestantism]].

Colombia lies at the crossroads of [[Latin American culture|Latin America]] and the broader American continent, and as such has been hit by a wide range of cultural influences. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Culture of Spain|Spanish]] and other [[Culture of Europe|European]], [[Culture of Africa|African]], [[Culture of the United States|American]], Caribbean, and [[Arab culture|Middle Eastern]] influences, as well as other Latin American cultural influences, are all present in Colombia's modern culture. Urban migration, industrialization, globalization, and other political, social and economic changes have also left an impression.

Many [[National symbols of Colombia|national symbols]], both objects and themes, have arisen from Colombia's diverse cultural traditions and aim to represent what Colombia, and the Colombian people, have in common. Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government through the [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Ministry of Culture]].

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Colombian literature}}
[[File:Gabriel Garcia Marquez, 2009.jpg|thumb|left|The [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel literature]], [[Gabriel García Márquez]].]]
[[File:Fi 322 Isaacs, Jorge.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jorge Isaacs]] was one of the greatest exponents of Colombian literature in nineteenth century.]]
Colombian literature dates back to Spanish colonial times; notable writers of the period include Hernando Domínguez Camargo and his epic poem to San Ignacio de Loyola, Juan Rodríguez Freyle ([[El Carnero|''The Billygoat'']]) and the nun [[Francisca Josefa de la Concepción|Francisca Josefa de Castillo]], representative of [[mysticism]]. Post-independence literature linked to Romanticism highlighted [[Antonio Nariño]], [[José Fernández Madrid]], [[Camilo Torres Tenorio]] and [[Francisco Antonio Zea]]. In the second half of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century the literary genre known as ''[[costumbrismo]]'' became popular; great writers of this period were [[Tomás Carrasquilla]], [[Jorge Isaacs]] and [[Rafael Pombo]] (the latter of whom wrote notable works of children's literature). Within that period, authors such as [[José Asunción Silva]], [[José Eustasio Rivera]], [[León de Greiff]], [[Porfirio Barba-Jacob]] and [[José María Vargas Vila]] developed the [[Modernismo|modernist]] movement. In 1871, Colombia established the [[Colombian Academy of Language]], the first Spanish language academy in the Americas.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/home/1592/article-130142.html |title= Colombian Academy of Language |publisher= colombiaaprende.edu.co |language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013}}</ref>

Between 1939 and 1940 seven books of poetry were published under the name ''Stone and Sky'' in the city of Bogotá that significantly impacted the country; they were edited by the poet Jorge Rojas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/boletin/bole69/bolet1a.htm |title=Artículo: Piedra y Cielo a contraluz |publisher=Lablaa.org |language = Spanish|accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> In the following decade, [[Gonzalo Arango]] founded the movement of "nothingness" in response to the violence of the time;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/boletin/boleti5/bol33/nadais10.htm |title= Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango |publisher=Lablaa.org |language = Spanish|accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> he was influenced by [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], and the thought of another great Colombian writer: [[Fernando González (writer)|Fernando González Ochoa]].

Colombian art has over 3,000 years of history. Colombian artists have captured the country's changing political and cultural backdrop using a range of styles and mediums. There is archeological evidence of ceramics being produced earlier in Colombia than anywhere else in the Americas, dating as early as 3,000 BC.<ref name="donquijote.org">{{cite web| url= http://www.donquijote.org/culture/colombia/art/ |publisher= donquijote.org | title= Colombian Art|accessdate= 22 August 2013}}</ref> The earliest examples of gold craftsmanship have been attributed to the Tumaco people <ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/gold-museum/tumaco |publisher= banrepcultural.org | title= Tumaco: People and Gold on the Pacific Coast|accessdate= 22 August 2013}}</ref> of the Pacific coast and date to around 325 BCE.

Colombian art has followed the trends of the time, so during the 16th to 18th centuries, [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Spanish Catholicism]] had a huge influence on Colombian art, and the popular [[Baroque]] style was replaced with [[Rococo]] when the Bourbons ascended to the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]]. More recently, Colombian artists [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martínez|Santiago Martínez Delgado]] started the Colombian Murial Movement in the 1940s, featuring the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] features of [[Art Deco]].<ref name="donquijote.org"/> Since the 1950s, the Colombian art started to have a distinctive point of view, reinventing traditional elements under the concepts of the 20th century. Examples of this are the Greiff [[portrait]]s by [[Ignacio Gomez Jaramillo]], showing what the Colombian art could do with the new techniques applied to typical Colombian themes. Carlos Correa, with his [[paradigm]]athic “Naturaleza muerta en silencio” (silent dead nature), combines geometrical [[Abstraction (art)|abstraction]] and [[cubism]]. [[Alejandro Obregón]] is often considered as the father of modern Colombian painting, and one of the most influential artist in this period, due to his originality, the painting of Colombian landscapes with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] and [[Expressionism|expressionist]] use of  [[animal]]s, (specially the [[andean condor]]). [[Fernando Botero]] and  [[Omar Rayo]] are probably the most widely known Colombian artists in the international scene.<ref name="donquijote.org"/>

The Colombian [[sculpture]] from the sixteenth to 18th centuries was mostly devoted to [[Religious art|religious depictions]] of ecclesiastic art, strongly influenced by the Spanish schools of [[sacred]] sculpture. During the early period of the Colombian republic, the national artists  were focused in the production of sculptural portraits of [[politician]]s and public figures, in a plain [[neoclassicist]] trend. During the 20th century, the Colombian sculpture began to develop a bold and innovative work with the aim of reaching a better understanding of national sensitivity.<ref name="Colombian sculptors">{{cite web |url= http://www.colombia.com/cultura/resenas/escultura.asp |title= Colombian sculptors|publisher = colombia.com|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013}}</ref>

Photography in Colombia began with the arrival in the country of the [[Daguerreotype]] that was brought by the [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros|Baron Gros]] in 1841. The first [[photographer]]s or [[Daguerreotype|daguerrotypists]] were [[painter]]s, several of the most prominent were Luis García Hevia, Fermín Isaza and Demetrio Paredes. The Restrepo brothers brought the technique known as [[Collodion process]] to Colombia. At the beginning of the 20th century the photographic work of Melitón Rodríguez, Leo Matiz, Benjamin de la Calle and Luis Benito Ramos allowed the development and support of the photo essay and photography as a document. In the middle of the 20th century began to be considered the artistic side of photography thanks to the work of several photographers, some of the most prominent Colombian photographers of this [[Art movement|artistic movement]] were Hernán Díaz, Abdú Eljaiek, Manuel H Rodríguez and Nereo López.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://biblioteca-virtual-antioquia.udea.edu.co/pdf/10/phot-mec-cfa.pdf| title= Apuntes para una cronología de la fotografía en Antioquía|language = Spanish|accessdate= 22 August 2013}}</ref>

In general, Colombian music blends European-influenced [[guitar]] and song structure with large gaita [[flute]]s and [[percussion]] instruments from the indigenous population, while its percussion structure and [[dance]] forms come from Africa. Colombian music reflects a wealth of musical influences that have given birth to a dynamic musical environment. Some of the most popular [[music genre]]s that have marked the Colombian music with special relevance are the [[cumbia]], [[vallenato]], [[joropo]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[bambuco]], [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]] and the [[classical music]].

Colombian architecture is mainly derived of adapting European styles to local conditions, and Spanish influence, especially [[Andalusia]]n, can be easily seen.  The [[Teatro de Cristóbal Colón|Teatro Colón]] in Bogotá is a lavish example of Colombian architecture from the Republican period, and the [[Primary Cathedral of Bogotá|Archbishopric Cathedral]] also in the capital, was made in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassic style]] in 1792, by Colombian architect Domingo de Petrés. [[Rogelio Salmona]], whose works are noted for their use of red brick and natural shapes, is a widely renowned Colombian architect.<ref name="donquijote.org"/>

Theater was introduced in Colombia during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] in 1550 through [[zarzuela]] companies. Colombian theater is supported by the Ministry of Culture and a number of private and state owned organizations.

==Health==
{{Main|Health care in Colombia}}
[[Life expectancy]] at birth in 2005 was 72.3 years; the life expectancy increased to 74.79 years by 2012.<ref name="CIAWFB"/> Health standards in Colombia have improved very much since the 1980s. A 1993 reform transformed public [[health-care]] funding by shifting the burden of [[subsidy]] from providers to users. As a result, employees have been obligated to pay into [[Health insurance|health plans]] to which employers also contribute. Although this new system has widened population coverage by the social and health security system from 21% (pre-1993) to 66% in 2005 and 96% in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/colombia/noticias/ministra-dice-cobertura-en-salud-fue-96|title = Ministra de Salud dice que la cobertura en este sector subió al 96%|language=Spanish|accessdate = 18 August 2013 |publisher= elpais.com.co}}</ref> health disparities persist, with the poor continuing to suffer less attention in their medical procedures.

Through [[Medical tourism|health tourism]], many people from over the world travel from their places of residence to other countries in search of medical treatment and the attractions in the countries visited. In Colombia, the potential is very large. For the quality of its health care professionals, a good number of institutions devoted to health, and an immense inventory of natural and architectural sites, Colombia is projected as one of Latin America’s main destinations in terms of health tourism.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.colombia.travel/en/international-tourist/sightseeing-what-to-do/recommended-tourist-attractions-special-reports/health-tourism-in-colombia|publisher= colombia.travel |title= Health Tourism in Colombia: Getting Ready to Become World Class |accessdate= 28 October 2013}}</ref> Cities such as Bogotá, Cali and Medellín are the most visited in cosmetic surgery and dental treatment for its high quality. Every year the city of Cali receives approximately 14,000 patients from abroad for cosmetic surgery procedures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-7754931|language=Spanish |publisher = El Tiempo |title=Cali, destino mundial para turismo de salud y cirugías estéticas |accessdate=31 January 2013}}</ref>

{{Main|Education in Colombia}}

The educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance at a preschool academy until age five (''Educación preescolar''). Basic education (''Educación básica'') is compulsory by law.<ref>Artículo 67, Constitución Política de Colombia</ref> It has two stages: Primary basic education (''Educación básica primaria'') which goes from first to fifth grade – children from six to ten years old, and Secondary basic education (''Educación básica secundaria''), which goes from sixth to ninth grade. Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education (''Educación media vocacional'') that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades. It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school.

After the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, a high-school diploma is awarded. The high-school graduate is known as a  ''bachiller'', because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called ''bachillerato'' (sixth to eleventh grade). Students in their final year of middle education take the [[ICFES Examination|ICFES test]] (now renamed Saber 11) in order to gain access to higher education (''Educación superior''). This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies, technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies.

''Bachilleres'' (high-school graduates) may enter into a professional undergraduate career program offered by a university; these programs last up to five years (or less for technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies), even as much to six to seven years for some careers, such as medicine. In Colombia, there is not an institution such as college; students go directly into a career program at a university or any other educational institution to obtain a professional, technical or technological title. Once graduated from the university, people are granted a (professional, technical or technological) diploma and licensed (if required) to practice the career they have chosen. For some professional career programs, students are required to take the Saber-Pro test, formerly known as ECAES, in their final year of undergraduate academic education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://menweb.mineducacion.gov.co/nnormas/normas_basicas_4.swf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070629194012/http://menweb.mineducacion.gov.co/nnormas/normas_basicas_4.swf |archivedate=2007-06-29 |title=Ministerio de Educación de Colombia, Estructura del sistema educativo |accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref>

Public spending on education as a proportion of gross domestic product in 2006 was 4.7% – one of the highest rates in Latin America – as compared with 2.4% in 1991. This represented 14.2% of total government expenditure.<ref name="UNESCO">{{cite web|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=289&IF_Language=eng&BR_Country=1700&BR_Region=40520 |title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics Colombia Profile |accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref> In 2006, the primary and secondary net enrollment rates stood at 88% and 65% respectively. School-life expectancy was 12.4 years.<ref name="UNESCO"/> A total of 92.3% of the population aged 15 and older were recorded as literate, including 97.9% of those aged 15–24, both figures slightly higher than the regional average.<ref name="UNESCO"/>
