'''Casimir III the Great''' ({{lang-pl|Kazimierz III Wielki}}) (30 April 1310 – 5 November 1370) who reigned in 1333–1370, was the last [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] from the [[Piast dynasty]], the son of King [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]] and Duchess [[Hedwig of Kalisz]].<ref name="Lerski">{{cite web | url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=luRry4Y5NIYC&lpg=PA249&ots=jQWOYd3L6Z&dq=Casimir%20III%20the%20Great&pg=PA249#v=onepage&q=Casimir%20III%20the%20Great&f=false | title=Casimir III the Great | publisher=ABC-CLIO Press | work=Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966–1945 | year=1996 | accessdate=September 8, 2012 | author=Halina Lerski | pages=249–250 | isbn=0313034567}}</ref>

Born in [[Kowal]], Casimir the Great first married Anna, or [[Aldona of Lithuania|Aldona Ona]], the daughter of Grand Duke [[Gediminas]] of [[Lithuania]]. The daughters from this marriage were Cunigunde (d. 1357), who was married to [[Louis VI the Roman]], the son of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and Elisabeth, who was married to Duke [[Bogislaw V|Bogislaus V of Pomerania]]. Aldona died in 1339, and Casimir then married [[Adelaide of Hesse]]. He divorced Adelaide in 1356, married Christina, divorced her, and while Adelaide and possibly Christina as well were still alive (ca. 1365), married Hedwig (Jadwiga) of Głogów and Sagan.

His three daughters by his fourth wife were very young at their father's death, and regarded as of dubious legitimacy because of Casimir's bigamy. Because all of the five children he fathered with his first and fourth wife were daughters, Casimir left no lawful male heir to his throne.

When Casimir, the last [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] king of Poland, died in 1370 from an injury received while hunting, his nephew King [[Louis I of Hungary]] succeeded him to become king of Poland in [[Union of Hungary and Poland|personal union with Hungary]].

==The Great king==

Casimir is the only Polish king who both received and kept the title of "Great" in Polish history ([[Bolesław I Chrobry]] is also called "Great", but his title Chrobry (Valiant) is now more common). When he came to the throne, his hold on it was in danger, as even his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him "king of [[Kraków]]". The [[economic system|economy]] was ruined, and the kingdom was depopulated and exhausted by war. Upon his death, Casimir left a kingdom which had doubled in size (mostly through the addition of lands in modern day [[Ukraine]], then called the Duchy of [[Halicz]]), was prosperous, wealthy and held great prospects for the future. Although depicted as a peaceful king in children's books, he in fact waged many victorious wars and was readying for others just before he died.

Casimir the Great built extensively during his reign, ([[Wawel Castle]], [[Orle Gniazda]]), reformed the Polish [[army]] and the Polish [[Civil law (private law)|civil]] and [[criminal law]]. At the [[Sejm]] in [[Wiślica]], on 11 March 1347, he introduced salutary legal reforms to the judicial system of his kingdom. He sanctioned a code of laws for Great and Lesser Poland, which gained for him the title of "the Polish Justinian" and founded the [[University of Kraków]], the oldest Polish University, although his death temporarily stalled its development (which is why it is today called the "Jagiellonian" rather than "Casimirian" University).

He organized a [[Congress of Kraków|meeting of kings in Kraków]] (1364) in which he exhibited the wealth of the Polish kingdom.

==Concession to the nobility==
[[Image:Subdue of Ruthenia in 1366 .png|thumb|left|175px|Subjection of [[Galicia-Volhynia|Ruthenia]] by the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]]  (1366), by [[Jan Matejko]]]]
[[Image:Wiec Kazimierz Wielki.jpg|thumb|right|175px|''[[Veche#Poland|Wiec]]'' in reign of Casimir the Great]]
In order to enlist the support of the [[szlachta|nobility]], especially the military help of [[pospolite ruszenie]], Casimir was forced to grant important privileges to their caste, which made them finally clearly dominant over townsfolk ([[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] or ''mieszczaństwo'').

In 1335, in the [[Treaty of Trentschin]], Casimir relinquished "in perpetuity" his claims to [[Silesia]]. In 1355 in [[Buda]], Casimir designated [[Louis I of Hungary]] as his successor. In exchange, the szlachta's tax burden was reduced and they would no longer be required to pay for military expeditions expenses outside Poland. Those important concessions would eventually lead to the ultimately crippling rise of the unique [[Golden Liberty|nobles' democracy]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

His second daughter, [[Elisabeth of Poland (1326–1361)|Elisabeth, Duchess of Pomerania]], bore a son in 1351, [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania|Casimir IV of Pomerania]]. He was slated to become the heir, but did not succeed to the throne, dying childless in 1377, 7 years after King Casimir. He was the only male descendant of King Casimir who lived during his lifetime.

Also, his son-in-law [[Louis VI the Roman]] of Bavaria, [[Margrave]] and [[Prince-elector]] of [[Brandenburg]], was thought as a possible successor as king of Poland. However, he was not deemed eligible as his wife, Casimir's daughter Cunigunde, had died already in 1357, without children.

The Poles repulsed many raids of the [[Tatar]]-[[Mongol]]s. However, Casimir III the Great submitted to the [[Golden Horde]] and undertook to pay tribute in order to avoid more conflicts.{{full|date=March 2013}}<ref>CICO-X, pp.189</ref> The 7 Mongol princes were sent by [[Jani Beg]] khan to assist Poland.{{Verification needed|date=March 2013}}<ref>Peter Jackson-the Mongols and the West, p.211</ref>

Casimir had no legitimate sons. Apparently, he deemed his own descendants either unsuitable or too young to inherit. Thus, and in order to provide a clear line of succession and avoid dynastic uncertainty, he arranged for his nephew, King Louis I of Hungary, to be his successor in Poland. Louis was proclaimed king on Casimir's death in 1370, and Casimir's sister Elisabeth (Louis's mother) held much of the real power until her death in 1380.

==Relationship with Polish Jews==
[[Image:Gerson Reception of the Jews.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Wojciech Gerson]], ''Casimir the Great and the Jews'']]
King Casimir was favorably disposed toward [[Jew]]s. On 9 October 1334, he confirmed the privileges granted to Jewish Poles in 1264 by [[Bolesław V the Chaste]]. Under [[penalty of death]], he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced [[Christianity|Christian]] [[baptism]]. He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of [[Jewish]] [[cemeteries]].

Although Jews had lived in Poland since before the reign of King Casimir, he allowed them to settle in Poland in great numbers and protected them as ''people of the king''.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=In Poland, a Jewish Revival Thrives—Minus Jews |url= |quote=Probably about 70 percent of the world's European Jews, or Ashkenazi, can trace their ancestry to Poland—thanks to a 14th-century king, Casimir III, the Great, who drew Jewish settlers from across Europe with his vow to protect them as "people of the king." |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date= 12 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-14 }}</ref>

==Relationships and children==
Casimir III married four times.

===Aldona of Lithuania===
On 30 April or 16 October 1325, Casimir married [[Aldona of Lithuania]]. She was a daughter of [[Gediminas of Lithuania]] and [[Jewna]]. They had two children:

*[[Elisabeth of Poland (1326-1361)|Elisabeth of Poland]] (ca. 1326–1361). She married [[Bogusław V, Duke of Pomerania]].
*[[Cunigunde of Poland]] (1334–1357). Married [[Louis VI the Roman]].

Aldona died on 26 May 1339. Casimir remained a widower for two years.

===Adelheid of Hesse===
On 29 September 1341, Casimir married his second wife, [[Adelaide of Hesse]]. She was a daughter of [[Henry II, Landgrave of Hesse]], and Elizabeth of Meissen. They had no children.

Casimir started living separately from Adelaide soon thereafter. Their loveless marriage lasted until 1356.

===Christina===
Casimir effectively divorced Adelaide and married his mistress [[Christina Rokiczana|Christina]]. Christina was the widow of Miklusz Rokiczani, a wealthy merchant. Her own origins are unknown. Following the death of her first husband she had entered the court of [[Bohemia]] in [[Prague]] as a [[lady-in-waiting]]. Casimir brought her with him from Prague and convinced the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] of [[Tyniec]] to marry them. The marriage was held in a secret ceremony but soon became known. Queen Adelaide renounced it as [[Polygamy|bigamous]] and returned to Hesse without permission.

King Casimir continued living with Christine despite complaints by [[Pope Innocent VI]] on behalf of Queen Adelaide. The marriage lasted until 1363/1364 when Casimir again declared himself divorced. They had no children.

===Hedwig of Żagań===
In about 1365, Casimir married his fourth wife Hedwig of Żagań. She was a daughter of [[Henry V of Iron]], Duke of [[Żagań]] and Anna of Mazovia. They had three children:

*[[Anna of Poland, Countess of Celje]] (1366 – 9 June 1422). Married firstly [[William of Celje]]. Their only daughter was [[Anne of Cilli]]. Married secondly Ulrich, [[Duke of Teck]]. They had no children.
*Kunigunde of Poland (1367–1370).
*Hedwig of Poland (1368 – ca. 1407). Reportedly married ca. 1382 but the details are obscure.

With Adelaide still alive and Christine possibly surviving, the marriage to Hedwig was also considered bigamous. The legitimacy of the three last daughters was disputed. Casimir managed to have Anne and Cunigunde legitimated by [[Pope Urban V]] on 5 December 1369. Hedwig the younger was legitimated by [[Pope Gregory XI]] on 11 October 1371.

===Cudka===
Casimir also had three illegitimate sons by his mistress Cudka, wife of a [[castellan]].
*Niemierz (last mentioned alive in 1386). Oldest son. Survived his father, inherited lands around [[Stopnica]].
*Pelka (1342–1365). Married and had two sons. Predeceased his father.
*Jan (d. 28 October 1383). Youngest son. Survived his father, inherited lands around Stopnica.
