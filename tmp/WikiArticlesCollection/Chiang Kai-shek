'''Chiang Kai-shek''' (October 31, 1887&nbsp;– April 5, 1975) was a 20th-century Chinese political and military leader. He is known as '''Jiang Jieshi''' or '''Jiang Zhongzheng''' in [[Standard Chinese]]. Chiang was an influential member of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), the Chinese Nationalist Party, and was a close ally of [[Sun Yat-sen]]. He became the [[Commandant]] of the Kuomintang's [[Whampoa Military Academy]] and took Sun's place as leader of the KMT when Sun died in 1925. In 1926, Chiang led the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] to unify the country, becoming China's nominal leader.<ref name=a>{{Cite book|last=Zarrow|first=Peter Gue|year=2005|title=China in War and Revolution, 1895–1949|pages=230–231}}</ref> He served as Chairman of the [[National Military Council]] of the Nationalist government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) from 1928 to 1948. Chiang led China in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (the Chinese theater of [[World War II]]), consolidating power from the party's [[Warlord Era|former regional warlords]]. Unlike Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek was socially conservative, promoting traditional Chinese culture in the [[New Life Movement]] and rejecting western democracy and the [[Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang|nationalist democratic socialism]] that Sun embraced in favor of an authoritarian government.

Chiang's predecessor, Sun Yat-sen, was well-liked and respected by the Communists, but after Sun's death Chiang was not able to maintain good relations with the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP). [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|A major split]] between the Nationalists and Communists occurred in 1927; and, under Chiang's leadership, the Nationalists fought a nation-wide [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against the Communists. After [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident|Japan invaded China in 1937]], Chiang agreed to a temporary truce with the CCP. Despite some [[Battle of Taierzhuang|early cooperative military successes against Japan]], by the time that the Japanese surrendered in 1945 neither the CCP nor the KMT trusted each other or were actively cooperating. 

After [[Marshall Mission|American-sponsored attempts to negotiate a coalition government]] failed in 1946, the Chinese Civil War resumed. The CCP defeated the Nationalists in 1949.  Westad says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China.  Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against Japan. Meanwhile the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism.<ref> Odd Arne Westad, ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750'' (2012) p 291</ref> 

Chiang's government and army retreated to [[Taiwan]], where Chiang imposed [[martial law]] and persecuted people critical of his rule in a period known as the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|"White Terror"]]. After evacuating to Taiwan, Chiang's government continued to declare its intention to retake mainland China. Chiang ruled the island securely as [[President of the Republic of China]] and General of the Kuomintang until his [[s:Will of Chiang Kai-shek|death in 1975]]. He ruled mainland China for 22 years, and Taiwan for 30 years.

==Early life==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}

===Childhood===
[[File:Chiang Kaishek in Baoding Military Academy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chiang Kai-shek in 1907 at the Baoding Military Academy]]
Chiang was born in [[Xikou, Fenghua|Xikou]], a town approximately {{convert|30|km|sp=uk}} southwest of downtown [[Ningbo]], in [[Fenghua]], [[Zhejiang]]. However, his [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]], a concept important in Chinese society, was the town of [[Heqiao]] ({{lang|zh-hant|和橋鎮}}) in [[Yixing]], [[Jiangsu]], approximately {{convert|38|km|abbr=on}} southwest of downtown [[Wuxi]], and {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} from the shores of [[Lake Tai]]. Chiang's father, Jiang Zhaocong ({{lang|zh-hant|蔣肇聰}}), and mother, Wang Caiyu ({{lang|zh|王采玉}}), were members of an upper-middle to upper-class family of salt merchants. Chiang's father died when he was only eight years of age, and he wrote of his mother as the "embodiment of Confucian virtues".

===In Japan: 1905–1911===
Chiang grew up in a time period in which military defeats and civil wars among warlords had left China destabilized and in debt, and he decided to pursue a military career. He began his military education at the [[Baoding Military Academy]], in 1906. He then left for the ''Tokyo Shinbu Gakko'' ({{lang|zh-hant|東京振武學校}}), an [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] Preparatory School for Chinese students, in 1907. There he was influenced by his compatriots to support the revolutionary movement to overthrow the [[Qing Dynasty]] and to set up a Chinese republic. He befriended fellow Zhejiang native [[Chen Qimei]], and, in 1908, Chen brought Chiang into the [[Tongmenghui]], a precursor of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) organization. Chiang served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] from 1909 to 1911.

===Return to China===
Returning to China in 1911 after learning of the outbreak of the [[Wuchang Uprising]], Chiang intended to fight as an artillery officer. He served in the revolutionary forces, leading a regiment in Shanghai under his friend and mentor, [[Chen Qimei]], as one of Chen's chief lieutenants. In early 1912, a dispute arose between Chen and a dissident member of the Revolutionary Alliance who opposed both Sun Yat-sen and Chen, and who sought to avoid escalating the quarrel by hiding in a hospital. When Chiang located him, Chen dispatched assassins, and although he probably did not take part himself, Chiang later assumed responsibility in order not to get Chen in trouble. Chen valued Chiang in spite of his now legendary quick temper, thinking that such bellicosity was useful in a military leader.<ref name="Taylor2009p24, 31">{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|pp=24, 31}}</ref>

After the success of the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 Revolution]], Chiang became a founding member of the KMT. After the takeover of the Republican government by [[Yuan Shikai]] and the failed [[Second Revolution]] in 1913, Chiang, like his KMT comrades, divided time between exile in Japan and the havens of the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. In Shanghai, Chiang cultivated ties with the city's underworld gangs, dominated by the notorious [[Green Gang]] and its leader [[Du Yuesheng]]. On May 18, 1916 agents of Yuan Shikai assassinated Chen Qimei. Chiang then succeeded Chen as leader of the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] in Shanghai. Sun Yat-sen's career was at its lowest point then, with most of his old Revolutionary Alliance comrades refusing to join him in the exiled Chinese Revolutionary Party.<ref name="Taylor2009p25-26">{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|pp=25–26}}</ref>

===Establishment of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou===
In 1917, Sun Yat-sen moved his base of operations to [[Guangzhou]], and Chiang joined him in 1918. At this time Sun remained largely sidelined; and, without arms or money, was soon expelled from Guangzhou and exiled again to Shanghai. He was restored to Guangzhou with mercenary help in 1920. After returning to Guangzhou, a rift developed between Sun, who sought to militarily unify China under the KMT, and Guangdong Governor [[Chen Jiongming]], who wanted to implement a [[federalist]] system with Guangdong as a model province. On June 16, 1923 Chen attempted to assassinate Sun and had his residence shelled. During a prolonged skirmish between the troops of these opposing forces, Sun and his wife [[Soong Ching-ling]] narrowly evaded heavy machine gun fire and were rescued by gunboats under Chiang's direction. The incident earned Chiang the trust of Sun Yat-sen.

Sun regained control of Guangzhou in early 1924, again with the help of mercenaries from [[Yunnan]], and accepted aid from the [[Comintern]]. Undertaking a reform of the KMT, he established a revolutionary government aimed at unifying China under the KMT. That same year, Sun sent Chiang to spend three months in Moscow studying the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] political and military system. During his trip in Russia, Chiang met [[Leon Trotsky]] and other Soviet leaders, but quickly came to the conclusion that the Russian model of government was not suitable for China. Chiang later sent his eldest son, Ching-kuo, to study in Russia. After his father's split from the [[First United Front]] in 1927, Ching-kuo was forced to stay there, as a hostage, until 1937. Chiang wrote in his diary, "It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&pg=PA59&dq=It+is+not+worth+it+to+sacrifice+the+interest+of+the+country+for+the+sake+of+my+son&hl=en&ei=vwe9TIvGF8L78Aa81ZzGDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=It%20is%20not%20worth%20it%20to%20sacrifice%20the%20interest%20of%20the%20country%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20my%20son&f=false|title=The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan|author=Jay Taylor|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=59|isbn=0-674-00287-3|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&pg=PA205&dq=It+is+not+worth+it+to+sacrifice+the+interests+of+the+country+for+the+sake+of+my+son&hl=en&ei=MgW9TNvcKsP78Abztqi1Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=It%20is%20not%20worth%20it%20to%20sacrifice%20the%20interests%20of%20the%20country%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20my%20son&f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|page=205|isbn=0-7867-1484-0|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> Chiang even refused to negotiate a prisoner swap for his son in exchange for the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] leader.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&pg=PA247&dq=It+is+not+worth+it+to+sacrifice+the+interest+of+the+country+for+the+sake+of+my+son&hl=en&ei=vAi9TLi0M8H68Ab-hJjsDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=It%20is%20not%20worth%20it%20to%20sacrifice%20the%20interest%20of%20the%20country%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20my%20son&f=false|title=The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-shek and the birth of modern China|author=Hannah Pakula|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=247|isbn=1-4391-4893-7|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> His attitude remained consistent, and he continued to maintain, by 1937, that "I would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation's interests." Chiang had absolutely no intention of ceasing the war against the Communists.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&pg=PA59&dq=chiang+sacrifice+son&hl=en&ei=nQW9TLK5MoT68Aaw9uAC&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=chiang%20son%20i%20would%20rather%20have%20no%20offspring%20than%20sacrifice%20our%20%20interests&f=false|title=The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan|author=Jay Taylor|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=74|isbn=0-674-00287-3|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref>

Chiang Kai-shek returned to Guangzhou and in 1924 was appointed [[Commandant]] of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] by Sun. Chiang resigned from the office for one month in disagreement with Sun's extremely close cooperation with the Comintern, but returned at Sun's demand. The early years at Whampoa allowed Chiang to cultivate a cadre of young officers loyal to both the KMT and himself.

Throughout his rise to power, Chiang also benefited from membership within the nationalist [[Tiandihui]] fraternity, to which Sun Yat-sen also belonged, and which remained a source of support during his leadership of the Kuomintang.

==Succession of Sun Yat-sen==

{{refimprove section|date=November 2013}}

===Competition with Wang Jingwei===
[[Sun Yat-sen]] died on March 12, 1925,<ref name=sundeath>{{Cite book|last=Eileen|first=Tamura|year=1998|title=China: Understanding Its Past|pages=174}}</ref> creating a power vacuum in the [[Kuomintang]]. A contest ensued between Chiang, who stood at the right wing of the KMT, and Sun Yat-sen's close comrade-in-arms [[Wang Jingwei]], who leaned towards the left. Although Wang succeeded Sun as Chairman of the National Government, Chiang's relatively low position in the party's internal hierarchy was bolstered by his military backing and adept political maneuvering following the [[Zhongshan Warship Incident]]. On June 5, 1926, Chiang became [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA),<ref name="Taylor2009p57">{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=57}}</ref> and on July 27 he launched a military campaign known as the [[Northern Expedition]] in order to defeat the warlords controlling northern China and to unify the country under the KMT.

The NRA branched into three divisions: to the west was Wang Jingwei, who led a column to take [[Wuhan]]; [[Bai Chongxi]]'s column went east to take Shanghai; Chiang himself led in the middle route, planning to take [[Nanjing]] before pressing ahead to capture Beijing. However, in January 1927, Wang Jingwei and his KMT leftist allies took the city of Wuhan amid much popular mobilization and fanfare. Allied with a number of [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] and advised by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agent [[Mikhail Borodin]], Wang declared the National Government as having moved to Wuhan. Having taken Nanking in March (and briefly visited Shanghai, now under the control of his close ally Bai Chongxi), Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang's leftist elements, which he believed threatened his control of the KMT.

Now with an established national government in Nanjing, and supported by conservative allies including [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's expulsion of the Communists and their Soviet advisers led to the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Wang Jingwei's National Government was weak militarily, and was soon ended by Chiang with the support of a local warlord ([[Li Zongren]] of [[Guangxi]]). Eventually, Wang and his leftist party surrendered to Chiang and joined him in Nanjing. In the [[Central Plains War]], Beijing was taken on June, 1928, from an alliance of the warlords [[Feng Yuxiang]] and [[Yan Xishan]]. In December, the [[Manchuria]]n warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]] pledged allegiance to Chiang's government, completing Chiang's nominal unification of China and ending the [[Warlord Era]].

In 1927, when he was setting up the Nationalist government in Nanjing, he was preoccupied with "the elevation of our leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the rank of 'Father of our Chinese Republic'. Dr. Sun worked for 40 years to lead our people in the Nationalist cause, and we cannot allow any other personality to usurp this honored position". He asked [[Chen Guofu]] to purchase a photograph that had been taken in Japan around 1895 or 1898. It showed members of the Revive China Society with [[Yeung Kui-wan]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|楊衢雲}} or {{lang|zh-Hans|杨衢云}}, [[pinyin]] Yáng Qúyún) as President, in the place of honour, and Sun, as secretary, on the back row, along with members of the Japanese Chapter of the Revive China Society.  When told that it was not for sale, Chiang offered a million dollars to recover the photo and its negative. "The party must have this picture and the negative at any price. They must be destroyed as soon as possible. It would be embarrassing to have our Father of the Chinese Republic shown in a subordinate position".<ref>'"Chiang Kai-Shek's Secret Past: The Memoir of His Second Wife, Ch'en Chieh-ju" by Ch'en Chieh-ju and George Chan, ed. by Lloyd E. Eastman, Westview Press, Boulder, 1993, pp. 248–249.</ref> Chiang never obtained either the photo or its negative.

Chiang made great efforts to gain recognition as the official successor of Sun Yat-sen.  In a pairing of great political significance, Chiang was Sun's brother-in-law: he had married [[Soong May-ling]], the younger sister of [[Soong Ching-ling]], Sun's widow, on December 1, 1927. Originally rebuffed by her in the early 1920s, Chiang managed to ingratiate himself to some degree with Soong May-ling's mother by first divorcing his wife and concubines and then promising to eventually convert to [[Christianity]]. On January 7, 1929, the Nationalist Information Bureau stated that Chiang was not a Christian<ref>{{cite news |title=CHINA: Christian Majority|newspaper=TIME|date=Monday, Jan. 7, 1929|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,929380,00.html|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref> After this, he was baptized in the [[Methodist]] church in 1929, a year after his marriage to Soong. Upon reaching Beijing, Chiang paid homage to Sun Yat-sen and had his body moved to the new capital of Nanjing to be enshrined in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]].

=== Rising power ===
In the West and in the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek was known as the "Red General".<ref name="Hannah Pakula 2009 346"/> Movie theaters in the Soviet Union showed newsreels and clips of Chiang. At Moscow, Sun Yat-sen University portraits of Chiang were hung on the walls; and, in the Soviet May Day Parades that year, Chiang's portrait was to be carried along with the portraits of [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], and other socialist leaders.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&pg=PA42&dq=chiang+portraits+streets&hl=en&ei=UGCaTKLlBsGB8gbyyeBX&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=snippet&q=chiang%20portraits%20marx&f=false|title=The Generalissimo's Son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan|author=Jay Taylor|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=42|isbn=0-674-00287-3|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> The United States consulate and other Westerners in Shanghai were concerned about the approach of "Red General" Chiang as his army was seizing control of large areas of the country in the Northern Expedition.<ref name="The Generalissimo">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=03catqbPCmgC&pg=PA602&dq=red+general+chiang&hl=en&ei=KniaTP6oC8G88gbJ7sGXAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=red%20general%20chiang&f=false|title=The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the struggle for modern China, Volume 39|author=Jay Taylor|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=602|isbn=0-674-03338-8|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wjCsAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA94&dq=red+general+chiang&hl=en&ei=KniaTP6oC8G88gbJ7sGXAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=red%20general%20chiang&f=false|title=Moscow and Chinese Communists|author=Robert Carver North|year=1963|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=94|isbn=0-8047-0453-8|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> The Western powers backed the [[Zhili Clique]], and were concerned about either the Soviet-backed Kuomintang or the Japanese-backed Fengtian Clique seizing control of China.

==Tutelage of China==

===Carrying out Sun Yat-sen's will===
Having gained control of China, Chiang's party remained surrounded by "surrendered" warlords who remained relatively autonomous within their own regions. On October 10, 1928, Chiang was named director of the State Council, the equivalent to President of the country, in addition to his other titles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=84}}</ref> As with his predecessor Sun Yat-sen, the Western media dubbed him "[[Generalissimo]]".<ref name="Taylor2009p57"/>

According to [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s plans, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) was to rebuild China in three steps: [[Martial law|military rule]], political tutelage, and constitutional rule. The ultimate goal of the KMT revolution was democracy, which was not considered to be feasible in China's fragmented state. Since the KMT had completed the first step of revolution through seizure of power in 1928, Chiang's rule thus began a period of what his party considered to be "political tutelage" in Sun Yat-sen's name. During this so-called Republican Era, many features of a modern, functional Chinese state emerged and developed.

The decade of 1928 to 1937 saw some aspects of foreign [[imperialism]], concessions and privileges in China, moderated through diplomacy. The government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems, attempted to stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in [[narcotic]]s, and augment industrial and agricultural production. Not all of these projects were successfully completed. Efforts were made towards improving education standards; and, in an effort to unify Chinese society, the [[New Life Movement]] was launched to encourage [[Confucianism|Confucian]] moral values and personal discipline. ''[[Standard Chinese|Guoyu]]'' ("National language"), was promoted as an [[Official language|standard tongue]], and the establishment of communications facilities (including radio) were used to encourage a sense of [[Chinese nationalism]] in a way that was not possible when the nation lacked an effective central government.

===Challenges and limitations===
Any successes that the Nationalists did make, however, were met with constant political and military upheavals. While much of the urban areas were now under the control of the KMT, much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened yet undefeated warlords and Communists. Chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action, but such action was costly in terms of men and material. The 1930 [[Central Plains War]] alone nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government and caused almost {{formatnum:250000}} casualties on both sides. In 1931, [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's old supporter, publicly voiced a popular concern that Chiang's position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the Nationalist government. Chiang had Hu put under [[house arrest]], but he was released after national condemnation after which he left Nanjing and supported a rival government in [[Guangzhou]]. The split resulted in a military conflict between Hu's Guangzhou government and Chiang's Nationalist government. Chiang only won the campaign against Hu after a shift in allegiance by the warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]], who had previously supported Hu Hanmin.

Throughout his rule, complete eradication of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] remained Chiang's dream. After assembling his forces in [[Jiangxi]], Chiang led his armies against the newly established [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]. With help from foreign military advisers, Chiang's [[Fifth Campaign]] finally surrounded the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] in 1934. The Communists, tipped off that a Nationalist offensive was imminent, retreated in the [[Long March]], during which [[Mao Zedong]] rose from a mere military official to the most influential leader of the Communist Party of China.

===Ideology: nationalism and anti-communism===
Chiang, as a nationalist and a Confucianist, was against the iconoclasm of the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Motivated by his sense of nationalism, he viewed some Western ideas as foreign, and he believed that the great introduction of Western ideas and literature that the [[May Fourth Movement]] promoted was not beneficial to China. He and Dr. Sun criticized the May Fourth intellectuals as corrupting the morals of China's youth.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dc4UAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA13&dq=chiang+may+iconoclastic+nationalist&hl=en&ei=P2yaTIiKJsKB8ga-oPVK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The May fourth movement in Shanghai: the making of a social movement in modern China|author=Joseph T.

Contrary to Communist propaganda that Chiang was pro-capitalism, Chiang Kai-shek antagonized the capitalists of Shanghai, often attacking them and confisticating their capital and assets for the use of the government. Chiang confiscated the wealth of capitalists even while he denounced and fought against communists.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gTv99LBYSL4C&pg=PA58&dq=chiang+shanghai+communists+capitalist+wealth+dictators&hl=en&ei=Lz7QTYXpAci-0AHNsJzgDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=communists%20charged%20shanghai%20ningbo%20capitalists%20interests%20seized%20their%20wealth&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of modern dictators: from Napoleon to the present|author=Frank J.

Chiang has often been interpreted as being pro-capitalist, but this conclusion may be problematic. Shanghai capitalists did briefly support him out of fear of communism in 1927, but this support eroded in 1928 when Chiang turned his tactics of intimidation on them. The relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and Chinese capitalists remained poor throughout the period of his administration.<ref name="capitalists" /> Chiang blocked Chinese capitalists from gaining any political power or voice within his regime. Once Chiang Kai-shek was done with his [[White Terror (mainland China)|White Terror]] on pro-communist laborers, he proceeded to turn on the capitalists. [[Green Gang|Gangster connections]] allowed Chiang to attack them in the International Settlement, successfully forcing capitalists to back him up with their assets for his military expeditions.<ref name="capitalists">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9nJF_19fnZ4C&pg=PA264&dq=chiang+shanghai+communists+capitalist+wealth&hl=en&ei=KD7QTdbGDfCD0QHeprWSDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Shanghai capitalists and the Nationalist government, 1927–1937|author=Parks M.

===Chinese Civil War: 1927–1937===
After the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, Chiang resigned as Chairman of the National Government. He returned shortly afterwards, adopting the slogan "first internal pacification, then external resistance". However, this policy of avoiding a frontal war against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] was widely unpopular. In 1932, while Chiang was seeking first to defeat the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]], Japan launched an [[January 28 Incident|advance]] on Shanghai and bombarded [[Nanjing]]. This disrupted Chiang's [[Chinese Civil War|offensives against the Communists]] for a time, although it was the northern factions of [[Hu Hanmin]]'s [[Guangzhou]] (Canton) government (notably the [[19th Route Army]]) that primarily led the offensive against the Japanese during this skirmish. Brought into the Nationalist army immediately after the battle, the 19th Route Army's career under Chiang would be cut short after it was disbanded for demonstrating socialist tendencies.

[[File:Chiang Kai-shek TIME Cover 1933.jpg|right|thumb|Chiang on the cover of a 1933 edition of TIME magazine]]

In December 1936, Chiang flew to [[Xi'an]] to coordinate a major assault on the [[People's Liberation Army|Red Army]] and the Communist Republic that had retreated into [[Yan'an]]. However, Chiang's allied commander [[Zhang Xueliang]], whose forces were used in his attack and whose homeland of [[Manchuria]] had been recently invaded by the Japanese, did not support the attack on the Communists. On December 12, Zhang and several other Nationalist generals kidnapped Chiang for two weeks in what is known as the [[Xi'an Incident]]. They forced Chiang into making a "[[Second United Front]]" with the Communists against Japan. After releasing Chiang and returning to Nanjing with him, Zhang was placed under house arrest and the generals who had assisted him were executed. Chiang's commitment to the Second United Front was nominal at best, and it was all but broken up in 1941.

===Second Sino-Japanese War: 1937–1945===
The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in July 1937, and in August of that year Chiang sent {{formatnum:600000}} of his best-trained and equipped soldiers to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]]. With over 200,000 Chinese casualties, Chiang lost the political cream of his [[Whampoa Military Academy|Whampoa]]-trained officers. Though Chiang lost militarily, the battle dispelled Japanese claims that it could conquer China in three months and demonstrated to the Western powers that the Chinese would continue the fight. By December, the capital city of Nanjing had [[Rape of Nanking|fallen to the Japanese]], and Chiang moved the government inland, first to [[Wuhan]] and later to [[Chongqing]].
Having lost most of China's economic and industrial centers, Chiang withdrew into the hinterlands, stretching the Japanese supply lines and bogging down Japanese soldiers in the vast Chinese interior. As part of a policy of protracted resistance, Chiang authorized the use of [[Scorched earth#Second Sino-Japanese War|scorched earth]] tactics, resulted in many civilian deaths.  During the Nationalist's retreat from Nanjing, the dams around the city were deliberately destroyed by the Nationalist army in order to delay the Japanese advance, killing 500,000 people in the subsequent [[1938 Yellow River flood]].

After heavy fighting, the Japanese occupied Wuhan in the fall of 1938 and the Nationalists retreated farther inland, to [[Chongqing]].  While en route to Chongqing, the Nationalist army intentionally started the [[1938 Changsha Fire|"fire of Changsha"]], as a part of the scorched earth policy. The fire destroyed much of the city, killed twenty thousand civilians, and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Due to an organizational error (it was claimed), the fire was begun without any warning to the residents of the city. The Nationalists eventually blamed three local commanders for the fire and executed them.  Newspapers across China blamed the fire on (non-KMT) arsonists, but the blaze contributed to a nation-wide loss of support for the KMT.<ref>Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen.

In 1939 Muslim leaders [[Isa Yusuf Alptekin]] and Ma Fuliang were sent by Chiang to several Middle eastern countries, including [[Egypt]], Turkey, and [[Syria]], to gain support for the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese War against Japan]], and to express his support for Muslims.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC&dq=xibei+jiuying+wangshi&q=chiang+bughra#v=snippet&q=chiang%20bughra%20return%20chongqing&f=false|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|year=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=0-415-58264-4|page=90|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref>

The Japanese, controlling the puppet-state of [[Manchukuo]] and much of China's eastern seaboard, appointed [[Wang Jingwei]] as a [[Quisling]]-ruler of the occupied Chinese territories around Nanjing. Wang named himself President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the National Government (not the same 'National Government' as Chiang's), and led a surprisingly large{{Quantify|date=May 2010}} minority of anti-Chiang/anti-Communist Chinese against his old comrades. He died in 1944, within a year of the end of World War II.

In 1942 Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek personally went on tour in northwestern China in [[Xinjiang]], Gansu, [[Ningxia]], Shaanxi, and [[Qinghai]], where he met both Muslim Generals [[Ma Buqing]] and [[Ma Bufang]].<ref>{{cite news |title=CHINA: He Who Has Reason|newspaper=TIME|date=Monday, Oct. 5, 1942|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,773741,00.html|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}</ref> He also met the Muslim Generals [[Ma Hongbin]] and [[Ma Hongkui]] separately.

During and after World War II, Chiang and his American-educated wife [[Soong May-ling]], known in the United States as "Madame Chiang", held the support of the United States' [[China Lobby]], which saw in them the hope of a Christian and democratic China. Chiang was even named the Supreme Commander of Allied forces in the China war zone. He was created a [[Knight Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of the Bath]] by [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King]] [[George VI of the United Kingdom]] in 1942.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777742,00.html?promoid=googlep | work=Time | title=BATTLE OF ASIA: Land of Three Rivers | date=May 4, 1942 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>

General [[Joseph Stilwell]], an American military adviser to Chiang during World War II, strongly criticized Chiang and his generals for what he saw as their incompetence and corruption.<ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.369</ref> In 1944, the United States Army Air Corps commenced [[Operation Matterhorn]] in order to bomb Japan's steel industry from bases to be constructed in mainland China.

However, Chiang Kai-shek's subordinates refused to take airbase construction seriously until enough capital had been delivered to permit embezzlement on a massive scale. Stilwell estimated that at least half of the $100&nbsp;million spent on construction of airbases was embezzled by Nationalist party officials.<ref name="wings11">{{cite episode|title=True Airpower|series=Wings: Clash of Wings|network=[[Discovery Channel]]|number=11}}</ref>

Chiang played off the Soviets and Americans against each other during the war. He first told the Americans that they would be welcome in talks between the Soviet Union and China then secretly told the Soviets that the Americans were unimportant and that their opinions would not be considered.

===Refusal of French Indochina===
[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], through General Stilwell, privately made it clear that they preferred that the French not reacquire [[French Indochina]] (modern day Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) after the war was over. Roosevelt offered Chiang Kai-shek control of all of Indochina.

After the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General [[Lu Han]] were sent by Chiang Kai-shek to northern Indochina (north of the 16th parallel) to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces there, and remained in Indochina until 1946, when the French returned.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iF3MG43x--0C&pg=PA30&dq=chiang+kai-shek+vietnam+french+concessions&hl=en&ei=_Y0OTYTpIsL38Aa2_MiwDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=chiang%20kai-shek%20vietnam%20french%20concessions&f=false|title=America's war in Vietnam: a short narrative history|author=Larry H.

===Treatment and use of Japanese soldiers===
In 1945, when [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japan surrendered]], Chiang's [[Chongqing]] government was ill-equipped and ill-prepared to reassert its authority in formerly [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese-occupied China]], and asked the Japanese to postpone their surrender until Kuomintang (KMT) authority could arrive to take over. This was an unpopular move among a population that, for many, had spent more than a decade under often brutal foreign occupation. American troops and weapons soon bolstered KMT forces, allowing them to reclaim cities. The countryside, however, remained largely under Communist control.

For over a year after the Japanese surrender, rumors circulated throughout China that the Japanese had entered into a secret agreement with Chiang, in which the Japanese would assist the Nationalists in fighting the Communists in exchange for the protection of Japanese persons and property there. Many top nationalist generals, including Chiang, had studied and trained in Japan before the Nationalists had returned to the mainland in the 1920s, and maintained close personal friendships with top Japanese officers. The Japanese general in charge of all forces in China, [[Yasuji Okamura|General Okamura]], had personally trained officers who later became generals in Chiang's staff. Reportedly, General Okamura, before surrendering command of all Japanese military forces in Nanjing, offered Chiang control of all 1.5&nbsp;million Japanese military and civilian support staff then present in China. Reportedly, Chiang seriously considered accepting this offer, but declined only in the knowledge that the United States would certainly be outraged by the gesture. Even so, armed Japanese troops remained in China well into 1947, with some noncommissioned officers finding their way into the Nationalist officer corps.<ref>Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles.

===Conditions during the Chinese Civil War===
Following the war, the United States encouraged peace talks between Chiang and Communist leader Mao Zedong in [[Chongqing]]. Due to concerns about widespread and well-documented corruption in Chiang's government throughout his rule, the U.S. government limited aid to Chiang for much of the period of 1946 to 1948, in the midst of fighting against the [[People's Liberation Army]] led by [[Mao Zedong]]. Alleged infiltration of the U.S. government by Chinese Communist agents may have also played a role in the suspension of American aid.<ref>Haynes, John Earl; Harvey Klehr, ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America'', New Haven: Yale University Press (2000), ISBN 0-300-08462-5, pp. 142–145</ref>

Chiang's right hand man, the secret police Chief [[Dai Li]], was both anti-American and anti-Communist.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GTgEPrlfvG4C&dq=chiang+portraits+streets&q=chiang+alientae+stalin#v=snippet&q=dai%20li%20oss%20anti%20american%20influence&f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|page=414|isbn=0-7867-1484-0|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> Dai ordered Kuomintang agents to spy on American officers.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GTgEPrlfvG4C&dq=chiang+portraits+streets&q=chiang+alientae+stalin#v=onepage&q=dai%20li%20oss%20american%20officers%20spied&f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|page=413|isbn=0-7867-1484-0|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> Earlier, Dai had been involved with the [[Blue Shirts Society]], a fascist-inspired paramilitary group within the Kuomintang, which wanted to expel Western and Japanese imperialists, crush the Communists, and eliminate [[feudalism]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jYYYQYK6FAYC&pg=PA75&dq=blueshirts+red+bandits+foreign+insults&hl=en&ei=gWmaTKa2L8G88gaF0rSxAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese secret service|author=Frederic E.

Though Chiang had achieved status abroad as a world leader, his government deteriorated as the result of corruption and inflation. In his diary on June 1948, Chiang wrote that the KMT had failed, not because of external enemies but because of rot from within.<ref>[http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/6731746.html Hoover Institution&nbsp;– Hoover Digest&nbsp;– Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for China]</ref> The war had severely weakened the Nationalists, while the Communists were strengthened by their popular land-reform policies,<ref>Ray Huang, cong dalishi jiaodu du Jiang Jieshi riji (Reading Chiang Kai-shek's dairy from a macro-history perspective), Chinatimes Publishing Press, Taipei, 1994, p. 441-3</ref> and by a rural population that supported and trusted them. The Nationalists initially had superiority in arms and men, but their lack of popularity, infiltration by Communist agents, low morale, and disorganization soon allowed the Communists to gain the upper hand in the civil war.

===Competition with Li Zongren===
A new [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] was promulgated in 1947, and Chiang was formally elected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] as the first term [[President of the Republic of China]] on May 20, 1948. This marked the beginning of what was termed the "democratic constitutional government" period by the KMT political orthodoxy, but the Communists refused to recognize the new Constitution, and its government, as legitimate. Chiang resigned as President on January 21, 1949, as KMT forces suffered bitter losses and defections to the Communists. After Chiang's resignation the vice-president of the ROC, [[Li Zongren]], became China's president.

Shortly after Chiang's resignation the Communists halted their advances and attempted to negotiate the virtual surrender of the ROC. Li attempted to negotiate milder terms that would have ended the civil war, but without success. When it became clear that Li was unlikely to accept Mao's terms, the Communists issued an ultimatum in April 1949, warning that they would resume their attacks if Li did not agree within five days. Li refused.<ref>Spence, Jonathan D. ''The Search for Modern China'', W.W. Norton and Company. 1999. ISBN 0-393-97351-4. p.486</ref>

Li's attempts to carry out his policies faced varying degrees of opposition from Chiang's supporters, and were generally unsuccessful. Chiang especially antagonized Li by taking possession of (and moving to Taiwan) US$200&nbsp;million of gold and US dollars belonging to the central government that Li desperately needed to cover the government's soaring expenses. When the Communists captured the Nationalist capital of Nanjing in April 1949, Li refused to accompany the central government as it fled to [[Guangdong]], instead expressing his dissatisfaction with Chiang by retiring to Guangxi.<ref name="Gillin289">Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p.289</ref>
[[File:Lizhongren2.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren]]
The former warlord [[Yan Xishan]], who had fled to Nanking only one month before, quickly insinuated himself within the Li-Chiang rivalry, attempting to have Li and Chiang reconcile their differences in the effort to resist the Communists. At Chiang's request Yan visited Li in order to convince Li not to withdraw from public life. Yan broke down in tears while talking of the loss of his home province of Shanxi to the Communists, and warned Li that the Nationalist cause was doomed unless Li went to Guangzhou. Li agreed to return under the condition that Chiang surrender most of the gold and US dollars in his possession that belonged to the central government, and that Chiang stop overriding Li's authority. After Yan communicated these demands and Chiang agreed to comply with them, Li departed for Guangdong.<ref name="Gillin289" />

In Guangdong, Li attempted to create a new government composed of both Chiang supporters and those opposed to Chiang. Li's first choice of premier was [[Chu Cheng]], a veteran member of the Kuomintang who had been virtually driven into exile due to his strong opposition to Chiang. After the Legislative Yuan rejected Chu, Li was obliged to choose Yan Xishan instead. By this time Yan was well known for his adaptability, and Chiang welcomed his appointment.<ref name="Gillin289" />

Conflict between Chiang and Li persisted. Although he had agreed to do so as a prerequisite of Li's return, Chiang refused to surrender more than a fraction of the wealth that he had sent to Taiwan. Without being backed by gold or foreign currency, the money issued by Li and Yan quickly declined in value until it became virtually worthless.<ref name="Gillin290">Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p.290</ref>

Although he did not hold a formal executive position in the government, Chiang continued to issue orders to the army, and many officers continued to obey Chiang rather than Li. The inability of Li to coordinate KMT military forces led him to put into effect a plan of defense that he had contemplated in 1948. Instead of attempting to defend all of southern China, Li ordered what remained of the Nationalist armies to withdraw to Guangxi and Guangdong, hoping that he could concentrate all available defenses on this smaller, and more easily defensible, area. The object of Li's strategy was to maintain a foothold on the Chinese mainland in the hope that the United States would eventually be compelled to enter the war in China on the Nationalist side.<ref name="Gillin290" />

===Final Communist advance===
Chiang opposed Li's plan of defense because it would have placed most of the troops still loyal to Chiang under the control of Li and Chiang's other opponents in the central government. To overcome Chiang's intransigence Li began ousting Chiang's supporters within the central government. Yan Xishan continued in his attempts to work with both sides, creating the impression among Li's supporters that he was a "stooge" of Chiang, while those who supported Chiang began to bitterly resent Yan for his willingness to work with Li. Because of the rivalry between Chiang and Li, Chiang refused to allow Nationalist troops loyal to him to aid in the defense of Guangxi and Guangdong, with the result that Communist forces occupied Guangdong in October 1949.<ref>Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p.291</ref>

After Guangdong fell to the Communists, Chiang relocated the government to [[Chongqing]], while Li effectively surrendered his powers and flew to New York for treatment of his chronic [[duodenum]] illness at the Hospital of [[Columbia University]]. Li visited the President of the United States, [[Harry S. Truman]], and denounced Chiang as a "dictator" and an "usurper." Li vowed that he would "return to crush" Chiang once he returned to China. Li remained in exile, and did not return to Taiwan.<ref>"CHINA: Return of the Gimo".  ''TIME Magazine''. Monday, Mar. 13, 1950.

In the early morning of December 10, 1949, Communist troops laid siege to [[Chengdu]], the last KMT controlled city in mainland China, where Chiang Kai-shek and his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] directed the defense at the Chengdu Central Military Academy. Chiang Kai-shek, father and son, sang the Republic of China National Anthem while leaving the Academy all the way to the airfield.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The aircraft ''May-ling'' evacuated them to Taiwan on the same day. Chiang Kai-shek would never return to the mainland.

Chiang did not formally re-assume the presidency until March 1, 1950. On January 1952, Chiang commanded the [[Control Yuan]], now in Taiwan, to impeach Li in the "Case of Li Zongren's Failure to carry out Duties due to Illegal Conduct" (李宗仁違法失職案). Chiang officially relieved Li of the position as vice-president in the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] on March 1954.

===Preparations to retake the mainland===
Chiang moved the government to [[Taipei]], Taiwan, where he formally resumed duties as [[President of the Republic of China]] on March 1, 1950.<ref>[http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2001/appendix1-1.htm#1950 ROC Chronology: Jan 1911&nbsp;– Dec 2000]</ref> Chiang was reelected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] to be the President of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on May 20, 1954, and again in 1960, 1966, and 1972. He continued to claim sovereignty over all of China, including the territories held by his government and the [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic]], as well as territory the latter ceded to foreign governments, such as [[Tuva]] and [[Outer Mongolia]]. In the context of the [[Cold War]], most of the Western world recognized this position and the ROC represented China [[China and the United Nations|in the United Nations]] and other international organizations until the 1970s.

This is intended as an analogy to the situation between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China]]
During his presidency in Taiwan, Chiang continued to prepare to take back mainland China. He developed the ROC army to prepare for an invasion of the mainland, and to defend Taiwan in case of an attack by the Communist forces. He also financed armed groups in mainland China, such as Muslim soldiers of the ROC Army left in Yunnan under [[Li Mi (ROC general)|Li Mi]], to continue to fight. It was only in the 1980s that these troops were airlifted to Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2002/chpt25-7.htm | title = Muslims in Taiwan | publisher=Government Information Office (ROC)}}</ref> He promoted the Uyghur [[Yulbars Khan]] to Governor during the [[Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950–1958)]] for resisting the Communists, even though the government had already evacuated to Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=warlords+and+muslims&source=bl&ots=KzhMe1dpqU&sig=YUq2zwbyUFNCsO5Jnt2RTAKL0rc&hl=en&ei=SdobTNyIEYO8lQfuvYm1Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&q=yulbars%20calcutta%20%20taiwan&f=false|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911–1949|author=Andrew D.

===Dictatorships===
Despite the democratic constitution, the government under Chiang was a [[one-party state]], consisting almost completely of [[Mainlander (China)|mainlander]]s; the "[[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]" greatly enhanced executive powers, and the goal of [[Project National Glory|retaking mainland China]] allowed the KMT to maintain a monopoly on power and the prohibition of opposition parties. The government's official line for these martial law provisions stemmed from the claim that emergency provisions were necessary, since the Communists and Kuomintang (KMT) were still in a state of war. Seeking to promote [[Chinese nationalism]], Chiang's government actively ignored and suppressed local cultural expression, even forbidding the use of local languages in mass media broadcasts or during class sessions.

The first decades after the Nationalists moved the seat of government to the province of Taiwan are associated with the organized effort to resist Communism known as the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|"White Terror"]], during which about 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned for their real or perceived opposition to the Kuomintang. Most of those prosecuted were labeled by the Kuomintang as "bandit spies" (匪諜), meaning spies for Chinese Communists, and punished as such. 

Under Chiang, the government recognized limited civil and economic freedoms, property rights (personal{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and intellectual) and other liberties.  Despite these restrictions, free debate within the confines of the legislature was permitted.  Under the pretext that new elections could not be held in Communist-occupied constituencies, the National Assembly, [[Legislative Yuan]], and [[Control Yuan]] members held their posts indefinitely. The Temporary Provisions also allowed Chiang to remain as president beyond the two-term limit in the Constitution. He was reelected by the National Assembly as president four times—doing so in 1954, 1960, 1966, and 1972.

Believing that corruption and a lack of morals were key reasons that the KMT lost mainland China to the Communists, Chiang attempted to purge corruption by dismissing members of the KMT accused of graft. Some major figures in the previous mainland China government, such as [[H. H. Kung]] and [[T. V. Soong]], exiled themselves to the United States. Though politically authoritarian and, to some extent, dominated by government-owned industries, Chiang's new Taiwanese state also encouraged economic development, especially in the export sector. A popular sweeping Land Reform Act, as well as American foreign aid during the 1950s, laid the foundation for Taiwan's economic success, becoming one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].

After the passing of Chiang Kai-Shek, the next president, Chiang's son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and Chiang Ching-kuo's successor, [[Lee Teng-hui]] a native Taiwanese, would, in the 1980s and 1990s, increase native Taiwanese representation in the government and loosen the many authoritarian controls of the early era of ROC control in Taiwan.

===Relationships with foreign governments===

====Japan====
[[File:Chiang Kai-shek memorial amk.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]] is a famous monument, landmark, and tourist attraction in Taipei, Taiwan.]]
In 1971, shortly after he had switched his country's [[diplomatic recognition]] from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China, the Australian Prime Minister, [[Gough Whitlam]], visited Japan. After meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, [[Eisaku Sato]], Whitlam observed that the reason Japan at that time was hesitant to withdraw recognition from the Nationalist government was "the presence of a treaty between the Japanese government and that of Chiang Kai-shek". Sato explained that the continued recognition of Japan towards the Nationalist government was due largely to the personal relationship that various members of the Japanese government felt towards Chiang. This relationship was rooted largely in the generous and lenient treatment of Japanese prisoners-of-war by the Nationalist government in the years immediately following the Japanese surrender in 1945, and was felt especially strongly as a bond of personal obligation by the most senior members then in power.<ref name="Journal1">Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles. "Staying On: Japanese Soldiers and Civilians in China, 1945–1949". ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 42, No. 3, May 1983. p. 516. {{jstor|2055515}}.</ref>

Although Japan eventually recognized the People's Republic in 1972, shortly after [[Kakuei Tanaka]] succeeded Sato as Prime Minister of Japan, the memory of this relationship was strong enough to be reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' (April 15, 1978) as a significant factor inhibiting trade between Japan and the mainland. There is speculation that a clash between Communist forces and a Japanese warship in 1978 was caused by Chinese anger after Prime Minister [[Takeo Fukuda]] attended Chiang's funeral. Historically, Japanese attempts to normalize their relationship with the People's Republic were met with accusations of ingratitude in Taiwan.<ref name="Journal1" />

====United States====
[[File:Ike cks.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Chiang with U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in June 1960.]]

Chiang was suspicious that [[Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Operations|covert operatives of the United States]] plotted a [[Coup d'état|coup]] against him. In 1950, Chiang Ching-kuo became director of the [[secret police]] ([[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]]), which he remained until 1965. Chiang was suspicious of politicians who were overly friendly to the United States, and considered them his enemies. In 1953, seven days after surviving an assassination attempt, [[Wu Kuo-chen]] lost his position as governor of Taiwan Province to [[Chiang Ching-kuo]].

Chiang Ching-kuo orchestrated the controversial court-martial and arrest of General [[Sun Li-jen]] in August 1955, for plotting a coup d'état with the American [[CIA]] against his father Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang.

==Death==

In 1975, 26 years after Chiang came to [[Taiwan]], he died in [[Taipei]] at the age of 87. He had suffered a major heart attack and [[pneumonia]] in the months before and died from [[renal failure]] aggravated with advanced cardiac malfunction at 23:50 on April 5.

A month of mourning was declared. Chinese music composer [[Hwang Yau-tai]] wrote the [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Song]]. In [[mainland China]], however, Chiang's death was met with little apparent mourning and [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] state-run newspapers gave the brief headline "Chiang Kai-shek Has Died." Chiang's body was put in a copper coffin and temporarily interred at his favorite residence in [[Cihu Mausoleum|Cihu]], [[Dasi, Taoyuan]]. When his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] died in 1988, he was entombed in a separate mausoleum in nearby [[Touliao Mausoleum|Touliao]] (頭寮). The hope was to have both buried at their birthplace in Fenghua if and when it was possible. In 2004, [[Chiang Fang-liang]], the widow of Chiang Ching-kuo, asked that both father and son be buried at [[Wuzhi Mountain Military Cemetery]] in [[Xizhi]], [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City). Chiang's ultimate funeral ceremony became a political battle between the wishes of the state and the wishes of his family.

Chiang was succeeded as [[President of the Republic of China|President]] by [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]] [[Yen Chia-kan]] and as [[Kuomintang]] party leader by his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], who retired Chiang Kai-shek's title of Director-General and instead assumed the position of Chairman. Yen's presidency was interim; Chiang Ching-kuo, who was the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], became President after Yen's term ended three years later.

The Kuomintang used traditional Chinese religious ceremonies, and promoted [[Martyrdom in Chinese culture]]. Kuomintang ideology promoted the view that the souls of Party martyrs who died fighting for the Kuomintang, the revolution, and the party founder Dr. Sun Yatsen were sent to heaven.

Chiang's legacy has been the target of heated debates because of the different views held about him. For some, Chiang was a national hero who led the victorious [[Northern Expedition]] against the [[Beiyang Government|Beiyang Warlords]] in 1927, achieving [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese unification]], and who subsequently led China to ultimate victory against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1945. Some blamed him for not doing enough against the Japanese forces in the lead-up to, and during, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], preferring to withhold his armies for the fight against the Communists, or merely waiting and hoping that the United States would get involved. Some also see him as a champion of [[anti-Communism]], being a key figure during the formative years of the [[World Anti-Communist League]]. During the [[Cold War]], he was also seen as the leader who led [[Free area of the Republic of China|Free China]] and the bulwark against a possible Communist invasion. However, Chiang presided over purges, political authoritarianism, and graft during his tenure in [[mainland China]], and ruled throughout a period of imposed [[martial law]]. His governments were accused of being corrupt even before he even took power in 1928. He also allied with known criminals like [[Du Yuesheng]] for political and financial gains. Some opponents charge that Chiang's efforts in developing Taiwan were mostly to make the island a strong base from which to one day return to mainland China, and that Chiang had little regard for the long-term prosperity and well-being of the [[Taiwanese people]].

Today, Chiang's popularity in Taiwan is divided along political lines, enjoying greater support among [[Kuomintang]] supporters. He is generally unpopular among [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) voters and supporters. In sharp contrast to his son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and to [[Sun Yat-sen]], his memory is rarely invoked by current political parties, including the Kuomintang.

In the United States and Europe, Chiang was often perceived negatively as the one who lost China to the Communists. His constant demands for Western support and funding also earned him the nickname of "General Cash-My-Check". In the West he has been criticized for his poor military skills. He had a record of issuing unrealistic orders and persistently attempting to fight unwinnable battles, leading to the loss of his best troops.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fenby|first=Jonathan|title=History of Modern China|pages=279}}</ref>

In recent years, there has been an attempt to find a more moderate interpretation of Chiang. Chiang is now increasingly perceived as a man simply overwhelmed by the events in China, having to fight simultaneously Communists, Japanese and provincial warlords while having to reconstruct and unify the country. His sincere, albeit often unsuccessful attempts to build a more powerful nation have been noted by scholars such as [[Jonathan Fenby]] and [[Rana Mitter]]. Mitter has observed that, ironically, today's China is closer to Chiang's vision than to [[Mao Zedong]]'s. He argues that the Communists, since the 1980s, have essentially created the state envisioned by Chiang in the 1930s. Mitter concludes by writing that "one can imagine Chiang Kai-shek's ghost wandering round China today nodding in approval, while Mao's ghost follows behind him, moaning at the destruction of his vision".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitter|first=Rana|title=Modern China|pages=73}}</ref> [[Liang Shuming]] opined that Chiang Kai-shek's "greatest contribution was to make the CCP successful. If he had been a bit more trustworthy, if his character was somewhat better, the CCP would have been unable to beat him".<ref>In an interview reported in "Has Man a Future?", page 224</ref>

[[Formosa Betrayed]], one of the few American movies concerning the process of democratization in Taiwan, depicts Chiang Kai-shek as a brutal dictator, responsible for the execution of thousands native Taiwanese during the days following the [[228 Incident]].

Like many other Chinese historical figures, Chiang used several names throughout his life. That inscribed in the genealogical records of his family is '''Jiang Zhoutai''' ({{zh|c=蔣周泰|w='''Chiang Chou-tai'''}}). This so-called "register name" (譜名) is the one under which his extended relatives knew him, and the one he used in formal occasions, such as when he got married. In deference to tradition, family members did not use the register name in conversation with people outside of the family. In fact, the concept of real or original name is not as clear-cut in China as it is in the Western world.

In honor of tradition, Chinese families waited a number of years before officially naming their offspring. In the meantime, they used a "milk name" (乳名), given to the infant shortly after his birth and known only to the close family. Thus, the actual name that Chiang received at birth was '''Jiang Ruiyuan''' ({{zh|c=蔣瑞元|w='''Chiang Jui-yuan'''}}).

In 1903, the 16-year-old Chiang went to [[Ningbo]] to be a student, and he chose a "school name" (學名). This was actually the formal name of a person, used by older people to address him, and the one he would use the most in the first decades of his life (as the person grew older, younger generations would have to use one of the [[Chinese style name|courtesy name]]s instead). (Colloquially, the school name is called "big name" (大名), whereas the "milk name" is known as the "small name" (小名).) The school name that Chiang chose for himself was Zhiqing ({{zh|c=志清|w=Chi-ching}}; means "purity of intentions"). For the next fifteen years or so, Chiang was known as '''Jiang Zhiqing''' ([[Wade-Giles]]: '''Chiang Chi-ching'''). This is the name under which [[Sun Yat-sen]] knew him when Chiang joined the republicans in [[Guangzhou]] in the 1910s.

In 1912, when Jiang Zhiqing was in Japan, he started to use the name '''Chiang Kai-shek''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 蔣介石; [[Pinyin]]: {{Audio|Zh-Jiang_Jieshi.ogg|'''Jiang Jieshi'''}}; [[Wade-Giles]]: Chiang Chieh-shih) as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded (''Voice of the Army'' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 軍聲). (''Jieshi'' is the [[Pinyin]] romanization of the name, based on [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], but the common romanized rendering is ''Kai-shek'' which is in [[Cantonese|Cantonese romanization]]. As the republicans were based in Canton (a Cantonese speaking area, now commonly known as Guangzhou), Chiang became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanization of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in [[Wade-Giles]])

[[File:Cihu President Chiang Mausoleum entrance.JPG|thumb|right|The entrance to Chiang's tombsite at [[Tzuhu]] (Cihu) uses the official posthumous rendering of Chiang Kai-shek (''[[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|from right to left]]''): The President (space) Lord Chiang Mausoleum.]]

"Kai-shek" soon became his [[Chinese style name|courtesy name]] (字). Some think the name was chosen from the classic Chinese book the ''[[I Ching]]''; others note that the first character of his courtesy name is also the first character of the courtesy name of his brother and other male relatives on the same generation line, while the second character of his courtesy name ''shi'' (石—meaning "stone") suggests the second character of his "register name" ''tai'' (泰—the famous [[Mount Tai]] of China). Courtesy names in China often bore a connection with the personal name of the person. As the courtesy name is the name used by people of the same generation to address the person, Chiang soon became known under this new name.

Sometime in 1917 or 1918, as Chiang became close to [[Sun Yat-sen]], he changed his name from Jiang Zhiqing to '''Jiang Zhongzheng''' ({{zh|c=蔣中正|w='''Chiang Chung-cheng'''}}). By adopting the name Chung-cheng ("central uprightness"), he was choosing a name very similar to the name of Sun Yat-sen, who was (and still is) known among Chinese as Zhongshan (中山—meaning "central mountain"), thus establishing a link between the two. The meaning of uprightness, rectitude, or orthodoxy, implied by his name, also positioned him as the legitimate heir of Sun Yat-sen and his ideas. Not surprisingly, the Chinese Communists always rejected the use of this name and it is not well known in [[mainland China]]. However, it was readily accepted by members of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] and is the name under which Chiang Kai-shek is still commonly known in Taiwan. Often the name is shortened to "Chung-cheng" only ("Zhongzheng" in Pinyin). For many years passengers arriving at the [[Chiang Kai-shek International Airport]] were greeted by signs in Chinese welcoming them to the "Chung Cheng International Airport". Similarly, the monument erected to Chiang's memory in Taipei, known in English as [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]], was literally named "Chung Cheng Memorial Hall" in Chinese. In Singapore, [[Chung Cheng High School]] was named after him.

His name is also written in Taiwan as "'''The Late President Lord Chiang'''" (先總統　蔣公), where the one-character-wide space known as [[nuo tai]] shows respect; this practice has lost some popularity. However, he is still known as ''Lord Chiang'' (蔣公) (without the title or space), along with the name ''Chiang Chung-cheng'', in Taiwan.

In an [[arranged marriage]], Chiang was married to a fellow villager named [[Mao Fumei]]. While married to Mao, Chiang adopted two [[concubine]]s (concubinage was still a common practice for well-to-do, non-Christian males in China): he married Yao Yecheng (姚冶誠, 1889–1972) in 1912 and [[Chen Jieru]] (陳潔如, 1906–1971) in December 1921. While he was still living in Shanghai, Chiang and Yao adopted a son, [[Chiang Wei-kuo|Wei-kuo]]. Chen adopted a daughter in 1924, named Yaoguang (瑤光), who later adopted her mother's surname. Chen's autobiography refuted the idea that she was a concubine. Chen claiming that, by the time she married Chiang, he had already divorced Mao, and that Chen was therefore his wife. Chiang and Mao had a son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo|Ching-kuo]].<ref>http://www.nndb.com/people/974/000086716/</ref>

According to the memoirs of Chen Jieru, Chiang's second wife, she contracted [[gonorrhea]] from Chiang soon after their marriage. He told her that he acquired this disease after separating from his first wife and living with his concubine Yao Yecheng, as well as with many other women he consorted with. His doctor explained to her that Chiang had sex with her before completing his treatment for the disease. As a result, both Chiang and Ch'en Chieh-ju believed they had become sterile, which would explain why he had only one child, by his first wife; however, a purported miscarriage by Soong May-ling in August 1928 would, if it actually occurred, cast serious doubt on whether this was true.<ref name="The Generalissimo"/><ref>''Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Past''. p 83-85.</ref>

==Relationships with generals, ethnic minorities, and religions==
[[File:Chiang Kaishek with Muslim General Ma Fushou.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chiang Kai-shek with the Muslim General [[Ma Fushou]].]]

{{refimprove section|date=November 2013}}

Chiang personally dealt extensively with religions and power figures in China during his regime.

===Relationship with Muslims===
Chiang Kai-shek developed relationships with other Generals. Chiang became a [[sworn brother]] of the Muslim General [[Ma Fuxiang]] and appointed him to high ranking positions. Chiang addressed Ma Fuxiang's son [[Ma Hongkui]] as Shao Yun Shixiong<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zeSeAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA77&dq=chiang+sworn+brother+ma+fuxiang&hl=en&ei=L2mKTLiJNIG8lQeZyPmkDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=chiang%20sworn%20brother%20ma%20fuxiang&f=false|title=Familiar China at war: regions of China, 1937–1945|author=Stephen R.

When Chiang became President of China after the [[Northern Expedition]], he carved out [[Ningxia]] and [[Qinghai]] out of Gansu province, and appointed Muslim Generals as Military Governors of all three provinces: [[Ma Hongkui]], [[Ma Hongbin]], and [[Ma Qi]]. The three Muslim governors, known as [[Xibei San Ma]] (lit. ''the three [[Ma clique|Mas]] of the [[Northwestern China|Northwest]]''), controlled armies composed entirely of Muslims. Chiang called on the three and their suboordinates to wage war against the Soviet Russians, Tibetans, Communists, and the Japanese. Chiang continued to appoint Muslims as Governors of the three provinces, including [[Ma Lin (warlord)|Ma Lin]] and [[Ma Fushou]]. Chiang's appointments, the first time that Muslims had been appointed as governors of Gansu, increased the prestige of Muslim officials in northwestern China.  The armies raised by this "Ma Clique", most notably their Muslim cavalry, were incorporated into the KMT army. Chiang appointed a Muslim General, [[Bai Chongxi]], as the Minister of National Defence of the Republic of China, which controlled the ROC military.

Chiang also supported the Muslim General Ma Zhongying, whom he had trained at [[Whampoa Military Academy]] during the [[Kumul Rebellion]], in a [[Jihad]] against [[Jin Shuren]], [[Sheng Shicai]], and the Soviet Union during the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]]. Chiang designated Ma's Muslim army as the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] and gave his troops [[Kuomintang]] flags and uniforms. Chiang then supported Muslim General Ma Hushan against [[Sheng Shicai]] and the Soviet Union in the [[Xinjiang War (1937)]]. All Muslim Generals commissioned by Chiang in the National Revolutionary Army paid alleigance to him. Several, like [[Ma Shaowu]] and Ma Hushan were loyal to Chiang and Kuomintang hardliners.

The [[Ili Rebellion]] and [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]] plagued relations with the Soviet Union during Chiang's rule and caused trouble with the Uyghurs. During the Ili Rebellion and Peitashan incident, Chiang deployed [[Hui people|Hui]] troops against [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] mobs in Turfan, and against Soviet Russian and Mongols at Peitashan.

During Chiang's rule, attacks on foreigners by Kuomintang forces flared up in several incidents. One of these was the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]] where a Muslim army loyal to the Kuomintang massacred 4,500 Uyghurs, and killed several British at the British consulate in Kashgar. The British were unable to retaliate.

[[Hu Songshan]], a Muslim Imam, backed Chiang Kai-shek's regime and gave prayers for his government. ROC flags were saluted by Muslims in Ningxia during prayer along with exhortations to nationalism during Chiang's rule. Chiang sent Muslim students abroad to study at places like [[Al Azhar]] and Muslim schools throughout China taught loyalty to his regime.

The Yuehua, a Chinese Muslim publication, quoted the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] to justify submitting to Chiang Kai-shek as the leader of China, and as justification for Jihad in the war against Japan.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&dq=ma+fuxiang+defence&q=jiang#v=onepage&q=jiang%20jieshi%20submit&f=false|title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication|author=Stéphane A.

The [[Yihewani]] (Ikhwan al Muslimun a.k.a. Muslim brotherhood) was the predominant Muslim sect backed by the Chiang government during Chiang's regime. Other Muslim sects, like the [[Xidaotang]] and Sufi brotherhoods like Jahriyya and Khuffiya were also supported by his regime. The Chinese Muslim Association, a pro-Kuomintang and anti-Communist organization, was set up by Muslims working in his regime. [[Salafism]] attempted to gain a foothold in China during his regime, but the Yihewani and Hanafi Sunni [[Gedimu]] denounced the Salafis as radicals, engaged in fights against them, and declared them heretics, forcing the Salafis to form a separate sect.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uHjR3yeIWzUC&pg=PA127&dq=gedimu+ikhwan&hl=en&ei=AXmOTNbGOcWqlAf-y8jmAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=gedimu%20ikhwan&f=false|title=Muslim diversity: local Islam in global contexts |author=Leif O.

===Relationship with Buddhists and Christians===
Chiang had uneasy relations with the [[Tibetans]]. He fought against them in the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], and he supported the Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]] in his war against Tibetan rebels in [[Qinghai]]. Chiang ordered Ma Bufang to prepare his Islamic army to invade [[Tibet]] several times, to deter [[Tibetan independence]], and threatened them with aerial bombardment.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} After the war, Chiang appointed Ma Bufang as ambassador to [[Saudi Arabia]].

Chiang incorporated [[Methodist]] values into the [[New Life Movement]] under the influence of his wife. Dancing and Western music were discouraged. In one incident, several youths splashed acid on people wearing Western clothing, although Chiang was not directly responsible for these incidents. Despite being a Methodist, he made reference to the [[Buddha]] in his diary, and encouraged the establishment of a Buddhist political party under Master [[Taixu]].
