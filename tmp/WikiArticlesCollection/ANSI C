'''ANSI C''' refers to the family of successive standards published by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) for the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]]. Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to the standards, as doing so aids [[porting|portability]] between compilers.

==History and outlook==

The first standard for C was published by ANSI. Although this document was subsequently adopted by [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and subsequent revisions published by ISO have been adopted by ANSI, the name ANSI C (rather than ISO C) is still more widely used. While some software developers use the term '''ISO C''', others are standards bodyâ€“neutral and use '''Standard C'''.

===C89 and C90===
In 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. After a long and arduous process, the standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C." This version of the language is often referred to as "ANSI C", or sometimes "C89" (to distinguish it from C99).

The same standard was ratified by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, with only formatting changes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Standards.html|title=Standards - Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)|accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> which is sometimes referred to as C90. Therefore, the terms "C89" and "C90" refer to essentially the same language.

ISO also published an amendment in 1994, referred to as AMD1, introducing minor changes to the language and the library.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/na1.html|title=A brief description of Normative Addendum 1|accessdate=2013-09-12}}</ref>

This standard has been withdrawn by both INCITS<ref name="ref1" /> and ISO/IEC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=17782|title=ISO/IEC 9899:1990 - Programming Languages -- C|accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

===C99===
{{Main|C99}}
In March 2000, ANSI adopted the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard. This standard is commonly referred to as C99.

This standard has been withdrawn by ISO/IEC in favour of C11,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=29237|title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 - Programming Languages -- C|accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> but is still approved by INCITS.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===C11===
{{Main|C11_(C_standard_revision)|l1=C11}}
"C11" is the new [[Open standard|standard]] for the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].

==Support from major compilers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
ANSI C is now supported by almost all the widely used compilers. Most of the C code being written nowadays is based on ANSI C. Any program written ''only'' in standard C and without any hardware dependent assumptions is virtually guaranteed to compile correctly on any [[system platform|platform]] with a conforming C implementation.  Without such precautions, most programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] libraries, or to the reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of certain data types and byte [[endianness]].

===Compliance detectability===
To mitigate the differences between [[K&R C]] and the ANSI C standard, the <code>__STDC__</code> ("standard c") macro can be used to split code into ANSI and K&R sections.
<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
 #if __STDC__
 extern int getopt(int, char * const *, const char *);
 #else
 extern int getopt();
 #endif
</syntaxhighlight>

It's better to use "<code>#if __STDC__</code>" as above rather than "<code>#ifdef __STDC__</code>" because some implementation may set <code>__STDC__</code> to zero to indicate non-ANSI compliance. "<code>#if</code>" will treat any identifiers that couldn't be replaced by a macro as zero (<code>0</code>). Thus even if the macro "<code>__STDC__</code>" is not defined to signify non-ANSI compliance, "<code>#if</code>" will work as shown.

In the above example, a prototype is used in a function declaration for ANSI compliant implementations, while an obsolescent non-prototype declaration is used otherwise. Those are still ANSI-compliant as of C99</ref></ref>

==Compilers supporting ANSI C==
* [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] (C K&R and C89/90)
* [[ARM Holdings|ARM]] RealView
* [[Clang]], using [[LLVM]] backend
* [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] (C89/90, a lot of C99, half of C11)
* [[Intel C++ Compiler|Intel's ICC]]
* [[LabWindows/CVI]]
* [[LCC (compiler)|LCC]]
* [[OpenWatcom]] (C89/90 and some C99)
* [[Visual C++|Microsoft Visual C++]] (C90. A few features of C99)
