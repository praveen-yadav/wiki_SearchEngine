The '''Bank of England''', formally the '''Governor and Company of the Bank of England''', is the [[central bank]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in the world, after the [[Sveriges Riksbank]], and the [[List of oldest banks|world's 8th oldest bank]]. It was established to act as the English Government's banker, and is still the banker for [[Her Majesty's Government|HM Government]].

==History==
[[File:Bank of England Charter sealing 1694.jpg|thumb|left|The sealing of the Bank of England Charter (1694)]]

England's crushing defeat by France, the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)|Battle of Beachy Head]], became the catalyst for England's rebuilding itself as a global power. England had no choice but to build a powerful navy. No public funds were available, and the credit of [[William III of England|William III]]'s government was so low in London that it was impossible for it to borrow the £1,200,000 (at 8 per cent) that the government wanted.

In order to induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The Bank was given exclusive possession of the government's balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank notes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bagehot|first=Walter|title=Lombard Street : a description of the money market|year=1873|publisher=Henry S. King and Co.|location=London|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4359}}</ref> The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The £1.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the navy.

As a side effect, the huge industrial effort needed, from establishing iron-works to make more nails to agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the navy, started to transform the economy.  This helped the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]&nbsp;– [[Acts of Union 1707|England and Scotland were formally united in 1707]]&nbsp;– to become powerful. The power of the navy made Britain the dominant world power in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.bbc.co.uk.news-channel.org/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2010/wk2/feature_sea.shtml |title=BBC: Empire of the Seas programme |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref>

The establishment of the bank was devised by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]], in 1694, to the plan proposed by [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]] three years before, but had not been acted upon.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EkUTaZofJYEC&dq=British+Parliamentary+reports+on+international+finance&printsec=frontcover#PPA25,M1 |title=Committee of Finance and Industry 1931 (Macmillan Report) description of the founding of Bank of England  |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= 1 January 1979|accessdate=10 May 2010|isbn=9780405112126}} "Its foundation in 1694 arose out the difficulties of the Government of the day in securing subscriptions to State loans. Its primary purpose was to raise and lend money to the State and in consideration of this service it received under its Charter and various Act of Parliament, certain privileges of issuing bank notes. The corporation commenced, with an assured life of twelve years after which the Government had the right to annul its Charter on giving one year's notice. '&#39;'Subsequent extensions of this period coincided generally with the grant of additional loans to the State'&#39;'"</ref> He proposed a loan of £1.2m to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as '''The Governor and Company of the Bank of England''' with long-term banking privileges including the issue of notes. The [[Royal Charter]] was granted on 27 July through the passage of the [[Tonnage Act 1694]].<ref>H. Roseveare, /The Financial Revolution 1660–1760/ (1991, Longman), pp. 34</ref> Public finances were in so dire a condition at the time that the terms of the loan were that it was to be serviced at a rate of 8% per annum, and there was also a service charge of £4,000 per annum for the management of the loan. The first governor was Sir [[John Houblon]], who is depicted in the £50 note issued in 1994. The charter was renewed in 1742, 1764, and 1781.

[[File:The Old Lady of Threadneedle St.png|thumb|right|Satirical cartoon protesting against the introduction of paper money, by [[James Gillray]], 1797. The "Old Lady of Threadneedle St" (the Bank personified) is ravished by [[William Pitt the Younger]].]]

The Bank's original home was in Walbrook in the City of London, where during reconstruction in 1954 archaeologists found the remains of a Roman [[Temple of Mithras, London|temple of Mithras]] (Mithras was&nbsp;– rather fittingly&nbsp;– worshipped as being the God of Contracts); the Mithraeum ruins are perhaps the most famous of all twentieth-century Roman discoveries in the City of London and can be viewed by the public.

The Bank moved to its current location on Threadneedle Street, and thereafter slowly acquired neighbouring land to create the edifice seen today. Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s rebuilding of the Bank, demolishing most of Sir [[John Soane]]'s earlier building, was described by architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as "the greatest architectural crime, in the City of London, of the twentieth century".

When the idea and reality of the [[National Debt]] came about during the 18th century this was also managed by the Bank. By the [[charter]] renewal in 1781 it was also the bankers' bank&nbsp;– keeping enough gold to pay its notes on demand until 26 February 1797 when [[French Revolution|war]] had so diminished [[gold reserves]] that the government prohibited the Bank from paying out in gold. This prohibition lasted until 1821.

The Bank also had a narrow escape of a different nature. In 1780, rioters in London tried to storm the building. Thereafter, every night until 1973, a detachment of soldiers patrolled the perimeter to ensure the safety of the nation's gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102005251#s=0-1 |title=Meet "The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street" — Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY |publisher=Wol.jw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref>

===19th century===
The 1844 [[Bank Charter Act]] tied the issue of notes to the gold reserves and gave the Bank sole rights with regard to the issue of banknotes. Private banks that had previously had that right retained it, provided that their headquarters were outside London and that they deposited security against the notes that they issued. A few English banks continued to issue their own notes until the last of them was taken over in the 1930s. Scottish and Northern Irish private banks still have that right.

===20th century===
[[File:Bank of England (1).jpg|thumb|left|The main Bank of England façade, c. 1980.]]
[[File:57 06 England Eltern Bank of England04.jpg|thumb|left|Traffic near Bank Junction, June 1957]]

Britain remained on the [[gold standard]] until 1931 when the gold and foreign exchange reserves were transferred to the [[HM Treasury|treasury]], but their management was still handled by the Bank. In 1998, the Bank was given responsibility for interest rate policy.

During the governorship of [[Montagu Norman]], from 1920 to 1944, the Bank made deliberate efforts to move away from [[commercial bank]]ing and become a central bank. In 1946, shortly after the end of Norman's tenure, the bank was nationalised by the Labour government.

After 1945 the Bank pursued the multiple goals of Keynesian economics, especially "easy money" and low interest rates to support aggregate demand. It tried to keep a fixed exchange rate, and attempted to deal with inflation and sterling weakness by credit and exchange controls.<ref>John Fforde, ''The Role of the Bank of England, 1941–1958'' (1992)</ref>

In 1977, the Bank set up a wholly owned subsidiary called [[Bank of England Nominees Limited]] (BOEN), a private limited company, with two of its hundred £1 shares issued. According to its Memorandum & Articles of Association, its objectives are:- “To act as Nominee or agent or attorney either solely or jointly with others, for any person or persons, partnership, company, corporation, government, state, organisation, sovereign, province, authority, or public body, or any group or association of them....” Bank of England Nominees Limited was granted an exemption by Edmund Dell, Secretary of State for Trade, from the disclosure requirements under Section 27(9) of the Companies Act 1976, because, “it was considered undesirable that the disclosure requirements should apply to certain categories of shareholders.” The Bank of England is also protected by its Royal Charter status, and the Official Secrets Act. BOEN is a vehicle for governments and heads of state to invest in UK companies (subject to approval from the Secretary of State), providing they undertake "not to influence the affairs of the company".<ref>{{cite web |title=Proceedings of the House of Commons, 21st April 1977 |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1977/apr/21/shareholdings-disclosure}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Guardian article on Queen's private wealth, 30th May 2002 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/may/30/jubilee.monarchy2 | location=London | work=The Guardian |date=30 May 2002}}</ref> BOEN is no longer exempt from company law disclosure requirements.<ref>{{cite web |title=Proceedings of the House of Lords, 26th April 2011 |url=http://services.parliament.uk/hansard/Lords/bydate/20110426/writtenanswers/part021.html}}</ref> Although a dormant company,<ref>{{cite web |title=Bank of England Nominees Company Accounts |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/56089866/BANK-OF-ENGLAND-NOMINEES-LIMITED-Company-accounts-from-Level-Business}}</ref> dormancy does not preclude a company actively operating as a nominee shareholder.<ref>{{cite web |title=Example of a Dormant Nominee Company |url=http://www.pilling.com/Nominee-Service.htm}}</ref> BOEN has two shareholders: the Bank of England, and the Secretary of the Bank of England.<ref>{{cite web |title=Freedom of Information Act response regarding Bank of England Nominees Limited |url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/28738/response/74019/attach/2/D.pdf}}</ref>

In 1981 the [[reserve requirement]] for banks to hold a minimum fixed proportion of their deposits as reserves at the Bank of England was abolished - see [[reserve requirement#United Kingdom]] for more details.

On 6 May 1997, following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] which brought a Labour government to power for the first time since 1979, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Gordon Brown]], that the Bank would be granted operational independence over monetary policy. Under the terms of the [[Bank of England Act 1998]] (which came into force on 1 June 1998), the Bank's [[Monetary Policy Committee]] was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government's [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Prices Index]] (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Key Monetary Policy Dates Since 1990 |publisher=Bank of England |accessdate=20 September 2007 |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/history.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070629143630/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 29 June 2007}}</ref> The target has changed to 2% since the [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the treasury's inflation index.<ref>{{cite web |title=Remit of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England and the New Inflation Target |publisher=HM Treasury |accessdate=20 September 2007 |date=10 December 2003 |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pdf/chancellorletter031210.pdf|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070926052337/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pdf/chancellorletter031210.pdf| archivedate= 26 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> If inflation overshoots or undershoots the target by more than 1%, the Governor has to write a letter to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] explaining why, and how he will remedy the situation.

The handing over of monetary policy to the Bank had been a key plank of the [[Liberal Democrats]]' economic policy since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]].<ref>Liberal Democrat election manifesto, 1992</ref> Conservative MP [[Nicholas Budgen]] had also proposed this as a [[private member's bill]] in 1996, but the bill failed as it had the support of neither the government nor the opposition.

==Functions of the Bank==
The Bank performs all the functions of a central bank. The most important of these is supposed to be maintaining price stability and supporting the economic policies of the Government, thus promoting economic growth. There are two main areas which are tackled by the Bank to ensure it carries out these functions efficiently:<ref name="Report2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/annualreport/2011/corepurposes2011.pdf |title=The Bank's core purposes |work=Annual Report 2011 |publisher=Bank of England |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref>
[[Image:Bank of England.jpg|right|thumb|Bank House, the Bank of England offices on King Street in [[Leeds]].]]

===Monetary stability===
:Stable prices and confidence in the currency are the two main criteria for monetary stability. Stable prices are maintained by making sure price increases meet the Government's inflation target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base [[interest rate]], which is decided by the [[Monetary Policy Committee]], and through its communications strategy, such as publishing [[yield curve]]s.<ref> Bank of England - Yield Curves by [[Internet Archive]].[http://web.archive.org/web/20110421034658/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/]</ref>

===Financial stability===
:Maintaining financial stability involves protecting against threats to the whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank's surveillance and market intelligence functions. The threats are then dealt with through financial and other operations, both at home and abroad. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may act as the [[lender of last resort]] by extending credit when no other institution will.
The Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability, including:
* [[HM Treasury]], the Government department responsible for financial and economic policy; and
* Other central banks and international organisations, with the aim of improving the international financial system.
The 1997 [[Memorandum of Understanding]] describes the terms under which the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA work toward the common aim of increased financial stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between the HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> In 2010 the incoming Chancellor announced his intention to merge the FSA back into the Bank. As of 2012, the current director for financial stability is [[Andy Haldane]].<ref name = "OccupyCorrect">{{cite news

The Bank acts as the government's banker, and it maintains the government's [[Consolidated Fund]] account. It also manages the country's [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]]. The Bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.

The Bank has a monopoly on the issue of [[banknote]]s in England and Wales. Scottish and [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one to one with deposits in the Bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845. The Bank decided to sell its bank note printing operations to [[De La Rue]] in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2003/041.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Sale of Bank Note Printing|accessdate=10 June 2006}}</ref>

Since 1998, the [[Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) has had the responsibility for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred to the new [[UK Debt Management Office]] in 1998, which also took over government cash management in 2000. [[Computershare]] took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds ([[gilt-edged security|gilt-edged securities]] or ''gilts'') from the Bank at the end of 2004.

The Bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries, although this responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in June 1998. After the financial crises in 2008 new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the Bank.  

In 2011 the interim [[Financial Policy Committee]] (FPC) was created as a mirror committee to the MPC to spearhead the Bank's new mandate on financial stability. The FPC is responsible for macro prudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.  

In order to help maintain economic stability, the Bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, a semiannual Financial Stability Report,<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref> and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public. It maintains a free museum and runs the [[Target Two Point Zero]] competition for A-level students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/index.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Bank of England: Education|accessdate=28 March 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070329072231/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/index.htm| archivedate= 29 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Asset purchase facility {{anchor|APF|Asset purchase facility}} ===
The Bank has operated, since January 2009, an Asset Purchase Facility (APF) to buy "high-quality assets financed by the issue of Treasury bills and the [[UK Debt Management Office|DMO]]'s cash management operations" and thereby improve liquidity in the credit markets.<ref name="APF">{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/apf/index.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Asset Purchase Facility|accessdate=12 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100726113941/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/apf/index.htm| archivedate= 26 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It has, since March 2009, also provided the mechanism by which the Bank's policy of [[quantitative easing]] (QE) is achieved, under the auspices of the MPC. Along with the managing the £200&nbsp;billion of QE funds, the APF continues to operate its corporate facilities. Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).<ref name="APF"/>

==Banknote issues==
{{Main|Bank of England note issues}}
The Bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were "White Notes", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White Notes were issued in £1 and £2 denominations. During the 20th century White Notes were issued in denominations between £5 and £1000.

Until the mid-nineteenth century, commercial banks were able to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=£2 note issued by Evans, Jones, Davies & Co.|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref> The [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] began the process of restricting note issue to the Bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] in 1921.<ref name=banknote-history>{{cite web|title=A brief history of banknotes|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/scottish_northernireland.htm|work=Bank of England website|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=fox-note>{{cite web|title=Fox, Fowler & Co. £5 note|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%C2%A35_not.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref> However, the limitations of the 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]], regulated by the Bank.<ref name=scot-ni/>

At the start of the [[First World War]], the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914]] was passed, which granted temporary powers to [[HM Treasury]] for issuing banknotes to the value of £1 and 10/- (ten shillings). Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible for gold through the Bank, replacing the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:

{{quotation|''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND – Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount – Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14)''.}}

Treasury notes were issued until 1928, when the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928]] returned note-issuing powers to the banks.<ref name="treasurynotes1">

During the Second World War the German [[Operation Bernhard]] attempted to counterfeit denominations between £5 and £50 producing 500,000 notes each month in 1943. The original plan was to parachute the money on the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe&nbsp;– although most fell into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above £5 to be removed from circulation.

In 2006, over £53&nbsp;million in banknotes belonging to the bank was [[Securitas depot robbery|stolen from a depot]] in [[Tonbridge, Kent]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm Record £53m stolen in depot raid], BBC, 27 February 2006</ref>

==The vault==
The Bank is custodian to the official gold reserves of the United Kingdom and many other countries. The vault, beneath the City of London, covers a floor space greater than that of the second-tallest building in the City, [[Tower 42]], and needs keys that are three feet long to open.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1079518/The-Big-Picture-This-vast-vault-gold-Bank-England-weather-credit-crunch.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Mike | last=Hanlon | title=The Big Picture: This vast vault of gold under the Bank of England should weather the credit crunch | date=22 October 2008}}</ref> The Bank is the 15th-largest custodian of gold reserves, holding around 4600 tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclusiveeconomy.com/2011/03/worlds-top-gold-reserves-by-countries/ |title=World's Top Gold Reserves By Countries |publisher=Exclusive Economy |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}</ref> These gold deposits were estimated in February 2012 to have a current market value of £156,000,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4104349/Inside-the-vaults-of-the-Bank-of-England.html |title=Inside the vaults of the Bank of England &#124; The Sun &#124;News |publisher=The Sun |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}</ref>
