'''Cryonics''' (from Greek κρύος ''kryos-'' meaning ''icy cold'') is the [[cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] of humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future.<ref>

[[Cryopreservation]] of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology. The stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent [[Information-theoretic death|information-theoretic definition of death]].<ref name="Whetstine L et al. 2005 538–542">{{cite journal |author=Whetstine L, Streat S, Darwin M, Crippen D |title=Pro/con ethics debate: When is dead really dead? |journal=Critical Care |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=538–42 |year=2005 |pmid=16356234 |pmc=1414041 |doi=10.1186/cc3894}}</ref> It is proposed that cryopreserved people might someday be recovered by using highly advanced technology.<ref name="Merkle RC 1992 6–16">{{cite journal |author=Merkle RC |title=The technical feasibility of cryonics |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=6–16 |year=1992 |month=September |pmid=1435395 |doi=10.1016/0306-9877(92)90133-W}}</ref>

Cryonics procedures ideally begin within minutes of cardiac arrest, and use [[cryoprotectants]] to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation. However, the idea of cryonics also includes preservation of people after longer post-mortem delays because of the possibility that brain structures encoding memory and personality may still persist or be inferable. Whether sufficient brain information still exists for cryonics to work under some preservation conditions may be intrinsically unprovable by present knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal

==Premises==
A central [[premise]] of cryonics is that [[long-term memory]], personality, and [[Personal identity|identity]] are stored in durable [[Cell (biology)|cell]] structures and patterns within the [[Human brain|brain]] that do not require continuous brain activity to survive.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mayford M, Siegelbaum SA, and Kandel ER | title=Synapses and Memory Storage | url = http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/4/6/a005751.full.pdf | quote = Procedural and declarative memories differ dramatically.
They use a different logic (unconscious vs. conscious recall) and they are stored in different
areas of the brain. Nevertheless, these two disparate memory processes share several molecular
steps and an overall molecular logic. Both are created in at least two stages: one that does not
require the synthesis of new proteins and one that does. In both, short-term memory involves covalent
modification of preexisting proteins and changes in the strength of preexisting synaptic
connections, whereas long-term memory requires the synthesis of new proteins and the
growth of new connections. Moreover, both forms of memory use PKA, mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), CREB-1, and CREB-2 signaling pathways to convert short-term to long-term
memory. Finally, both forms appear to use morphological changes at synapses to stabilize
long-term memory | journal=Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol |date=April 10, 2012 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a005751}}</ref> This premise is generally accepted in medicine; it is known that under certain conditions the brain can stop functioning and still later recover with retention of long-term memory.<ref>{{cite book

==Obstacles to success==

=== Preservation injury ===
Long-term cryopreservation can be achieved by cooling to near 77.15 [[Kelvin]], the [[boiling point]] of [[liquid nitrogen]]. It is a common mistaken belief that cells will lyse (burst) due to the formation of ice crystals within the cell, since this only occurs if the freezing rate exceeds the osmotic loss of water to the extracellular space.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mazur P |title=Freezing of living cells: mechanisms and implications |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |volume=247 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=C125–42 |year=1984 |month=September |pmid=6383068 |url=http://ajpcell.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=6383068}}</ref> However, damage from freezing can still be serious; ice may still form between cells, causing mechanical and chemical damage. Cryonics organizations use [[cryoprotectant]]s to reduce this damage. Cryoprotectant solutions are circulated through blood vessels to remove and replace water inside cells with chemicals that prevent freezing. This can reduce damage greatly,<ref>{{cite book| url = http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/braincryopreservation1.html| accessdate = 2006-03-17| title = New Brain Study Shows Reduced Tissue Damage| last = Platt| first = Charles| publisher = CryoCare Foundation| year = 1995| work = CryoCare Report| edition = 4}}</ref> but freezing of the entire body still causes injuries that are not reversible with present technology. The difficulties of recovering complex organisms from a frozen state have been long known.  Attempts to recover large frozen mammals by simple rewarming were abandoned by 1957.<ref>Smith, Audrey U.  (1957) [http://www.jstor.org/stable/83173 Problems in the Resuscitation of Mammals from Body Temperatures Below 0 degrees C"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences'' '''147'''(929):533-44</ref>

When used at high concentrations, cryoprotectants stop ice formation completely. Cooling and solidification without crystal formation is called [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fahy GM, MacFarlane DR, Angell CA, Meryman HT |title=Vitrification as an approach to cryopreservation |journal=Cryobiology |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=407–26 |year=1984 |month=August |pmid=6467964 |doi=10.1016/0011-2240(84)90079-8}}</ref> The first cryoprotectant solutions able to vitrify at very slow cooling rates while still being compatible with tissue survival were developed in the late 1990s by [[Cryobiology|cryobiologists]] [[Greg Fahy|Gregory Fahy]] and [[Brian Wowk]] for the purpose of banking transplantable organs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fahy GM, Wowk B, Wu J, ''et al.'' |title=Cryopreservation of organs by vitrification: perspectives and recent advances |journal=Cryobiology |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=157–78 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15094092 |doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2004.02.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2005.03.002 |title=Corrigendum to "Cryopreservation of organs by vitrification: perspectives and recent advances" [Cryobiology 48 (2004) 157–178] |year=2005 |last1=Fahy |first1=G |last2=Wowk |first2=B |last3=Wu |first3=J |last4=Phan |first4=J |last5=Rasch |first5=C |last6=Chang |first6=A |last7=Zendejas |first7=E |journal=Cryobiology |volume=50 |page=344 |issue=3}}</ref> These solutions were adopted for use in cryonics by the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]], for which they are believed to permit [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] of some parts of the human body, especially the brain.<ref>{{cite web | title = New Cryopreservation Technology | publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation | month= October | year= 2005 | url = http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/newtechnology.html | accessdate = 2007-04-29}}</ref> This has allowed animal brains to be vitrified, warmed back up, and examined for ice damage using light and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]].

Vitrification in cryonics is different than vitrification in mainstream cryobiology because vitrification in cryonics is not reversible with current technology. It is only structural vitrification. When successful it can prevent freezing injury in some body parts, but at the price of toxicity caused by cryoprotectant chemicals. The nature of this toxicity is still poorly understood. Cryonicists assume that toxicity is more subtle and repairable than obvious structural damage that would otherwise be caused by freezing. If, for example, toxicity is due to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] [[protein]]s, those proteins could be repaired or replaced.

=== Ischemic injury ===
[[Ischemia]] means inadequate or absent blood circulation that deprives tissue of oxygen and nutrients. At least several minutes of ischemia is a typical part of cryonics because of the common legal requirement that cryonics procedures do not begin until after blood circulation stops. The heart must stop beating so that [[legal death]] can be declared. When there is advance notice of impending [[legal death]], it is sometimes possible to deploy a team of technicians to perform a “standby procedure”. The team artificially restores blood circulation and breathing using techniques similar to [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] as soon as possible after the heart stops.<ref>{{cite web

Often in cryonics the brain is without oxygen for many minutes at warm temperatures, or even hours if the heart stops unexpectedly. This causes ischemic injury to the brain and other tissues that makes resuscitation impossible by present medical technology. Cryonicists justify preservation under such conditions by noting recent advances that allow brain resuscitation after longer periods of ischemia than the traditional 4-to-6-minute limit, and persistence of brain structure and even some brain cell function after long periods of [[clinical death]].<ref name = "Donaldson-1976">{{cite book

===Revival===

Freitas Jr., Nanomedicine, Landes Bioscience; Vol I (1999), Vol IIA (2003) [http://www.nanomedicine.com Nanomedicine.com]</ref> or [[mind uploading]] as key technologies. Revival requires repairing damage from lack of oxygen, cryoprotectant toxicity, thermal stress (fracturing), freezing in tissues that do not successfully vitrify, and reversing the effects that caused the patient's death. In many cases extensive [[Regeneration (biology)|tissue regeneration]] will be necessary. Hypothetical revival scenarios generally envision repairs being performed by vast numbers of microscopic organisms or devices.<ref>{{cite book

More radically, [[mind transfer]] has also been suggested as a possible revival approach if and when technology is ever developed to scan the memory contents of a preserved brain.

It has sometimes been written that cryonics revival will be a [[LIFO (computing)|last in, first out]] process. People cryopreserved in the future, with better technology, may require less advanced technology to be revived because they will have been cryopreserved with better technology that caused less damage to tissue. In this view, preservation methods will get progressively better until eventually they are demonstrably reversible, after which medicine will begin to reach back and revive people cryopreserved by more primitive methods. Revival of people cryopreserved by early cryonics technology may require centuries, if it is possible at all.<ref name = "Donaldson-1976"/> The "last in, first out" view of cryonics has been criticized because the quality of cryopreservation depends on many factors other than the era in which cryopreservation takes place.<ref>{{cite web

It has been claimed that if technologies for general molecular analysis and repair are ever developed, then theoretically any damaged body could be “revived”.<ref>{{cite web

Survival would then depend on whether preserved brain information was sufficient to permit restoration of all or part of the personal identity of the original person, with [[amnesia]] being the final dividing line between success and failure.

==Neuropreservation==
[[Neuropreservation]] is cryopreservation of the brain, often within the head, with surgical removal and disposal (usually cremation) of the rest of the body. Neuropreservation, sometimes called “neuro,” is one of two distinct preservation options in cryonics, the other being "whole body" preservation.

Neuropreservation is motivated by the [[Human brain|brain]]'s role as the primary repository of memory and personal identity. (For instance, spinal cord injury victims, organ transplant patients, and amputees retain their personal identity.) It is also motivated by the belief that reversing any type of cryonic preservation is so difficult and complex that any future technology capable of it must by its nature be capable of generalized [[regeneration (biology)|tissue regeneration]], including growth of a new body around a repaired brain. Some suggested revival scenarios for whole body patients even involve discarding the original body and regenerating a new body because tissues are so badly damaged by the preservation process. These considerations, along with lower costs, easier transportation in emergencies, and the specific focus on brain preservation quality, have motivated many cryonicists to choose neuropreservation.

The advantages and disadvantages of neuropreservation are often debated among cryonics advocates. Critics of neuropreservation note that the body is a record of much life experience. While few cryonicists doubt that a revived neuro patient would be the same person, there are wider questions about how a regenerated body might feel different from the original.<ref>{{cite book

| accessdate = 2006-03-16}}</ref> Partly for these reasons (as well as for better public relations), the [[Cryonics Institute]] preserves only whole bodies. Some proponents of neuropreservation agree with these concerns, but still feel that lower costs and better brain preservation justify concentrating preservation efforts on the brain. About two-thirds of the patients stored at Alcor are neuropreservation patients. Although the [[American Cryonics Society]] no longer offers the neuropreservation option, about half of their patients are "neuros".

==Financial Difficulties==
Financing storage of a cryonics patient at a cryonics organization by an on-going payment system was done in the early days of cryonics, but this system proved to be unworkable. Cryonics patients are to be stored for many decades, if not a century or two or longer, and a reliable source of outside funding is highly unlikely. Pay-as-you go funding was part of the reason for the CSC Chatsworth financial failure described in the history section. All modern cryonics organizations require full payment for all future costs associated with storage "in perpetuity" before patient cryostorage will be accepted.

Costs of cryonics vary greatly, ranging from the basic fee of $12,000 for neuro (head or brain only) cryopreservation at the European cryonics company [[KrioRus]], to more than $250,000 for whole body cryopreservation by Alcor with overseas and last-minute fees.<ref name="CryoCompare" /> Alcor's [[neuropreservation]] is priced at $80,000 while a full body preservation is priced at $200,000. There is an extra $500 annual membership fee during life by Alcor.<ref>{{cite web | title = Membership info: costs | publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation | url = http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/scheduleA.html }}</ref><ref>''Modern Marvels: Deep Freeze''.

The [[Cryonics Institute]] fee of $28,000 or $35,000 does not include “standby” (a team waits for death to occur and begins procedures at bedside), transportation costs, or funeral director expenses outside of Michigan, which must be purchased as extras.<ref name="CryoCompare" /> CI Members wanting Standby and Transport from cryonics professionals can contract for additional payment to the Florida-based company Suspended Animation, Inc.<ref name="CryoCompare" />

While cryonics is sometimes suspected of being greatly profitable, the high expenses of doing cryonics are well documented.<ref>{{cite book| url = http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/CostOfCryonics.html| title = The Cost of Cryonics| last = Darwin| first = Mike| publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation| work = Cryonics| year = 1990| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}</ref> The expenses are comparable to major [[Organ transplantation|transplant]] surgeries. The two most expensive things are standby expenses (a team of 5+ people needs to be hired for up to several weeks) and the money that must be set aside to generate interest to pay for storage of the patient in liquid nitrogen in perpetuity (especially for whole body patients).

The most common method of paying for cryonics is [[life insurance]], which spreads the cost over many years. Cryonics advocates are quick to point out that such insurance is especially affordable for young people. Cryonics providers claim that even the most expensive cryonics plans are “affordable for the vast majority” of people in the industrialized world who really want it and plan for it in advance. With the advent of low-cost cryonics provided by companies such as KrioRus (so far in Europe only) cryonics becomes feasible even for last-minute cases.

==Legal issues==
Legally, cryonics patients are treated as [[deceased]] persons.<ref>[http://www.evidencebasedcryonics.org/2012/02/23/legal-protection-of-cryonics-patients-part-1/ Legal Protection of Cryonics Patients, Part 1], INSTITUTE FOR EVIDENCE BASED CRYONICS</ref><ref>[http://www.evidencebasedcryonics.org/2012/05/05/legal-protection-of-cryonics-patients-part-2/  Legal Protection of Cryonics Patients, Part 2], INSTITUTE FOR EVIDENCE BASED CRYONICS</ref><ref>[http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/legalstatus.html   The Legal Status of Cryonics Patients], Alcor Life Extension Foundation</ref><ref>[http://www.cryonics.org/documents/CS_Agreement.html CRYONIC SUSPENSION AGREEMENT], Cryonics Institute</ref><ref>[http://www.alcor.org/Library/pdfs/signup-CryopreservationAgreement.pdf Cryopreservation Agreement], Alcor Life Extension Foundation</ref> A long established legal tradition, the concept of "lost persons," permits a person who has been declared legally dead to later be declared legally alive.  Cryonics Providers tend to be treated as medical research institutes.

==Standby services and transportation==
Stand-by and transportation is a critical phase in a cryopreservation process.  Cryonics patients need a professional response team to stand ready for suspended animation, when the patients are legally declared as dead.  Standby services include [[stabilization]], cooling, and other procedure to ensure that the damage to the patient during transportation are minimal.  Some cryonics services provider may provide standby as well as transportation services to their client.<ref>[http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/standby.html COMPREHENSIVE MEMBER STANDBY], Alcor Life Extension Foundation</ref><ref>[http://www.cryonics.org/resources/shipping-cryonics-patients Shipping a Cryonics Patients], Cryonics Institute</ref>

==Philosophical and ethical considerations==
Cryonics is based on a view of dying as a process that can be stopped in the minutes, and perhaps hours, following [[legal death]]. If death is not an event that happens suddenly when the heart stops (and "legal death" is often pronounced) this raises philosophical questions about what exactly death is. In 2005 an ethics debate in the medical journal, Critical Care, noted “…few if any patients pronounced dead by today’s physicians are in fact truly dead by any scientifically rigorous criteria.”<ref>{{cite book

Ethical and [[theological]] opinions of cryonics tend to pivot on the issue of whether cryonics is regarded as [[interment]] or medicine. If cryonics is interment, then religious beliefs about death and [[afterlife]] may come into consideration. Resuscitation may be deemed impossible by those with religious beliefs because the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is gone, and according to most religions only a deity can resurrect the dead. Cryonics advocates complain that theological dismissal of cryonics because it is interment is a [[circular argument]] because calling cryonics "interment" presumes ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' that cryonics cannot work.<ref>{{cite web

authored a paper entitled “Cryonic-Hibernation in Light of the Bioethical Principles of Beauchamp and Childress.” Dr. Tandy considered the four bioethical factors or principles articulated by philosophers Beauchamp and Childress as they apply to cryonics. These four principles are 1) respect for autonomy; 2) nonmaleficence; 3) beneficence; and 4) justice. Tandy concluded that in respect to all four principles “biomedical professionals have a strong (not weak) and actual (not prima facie, but binding) obligation to help insure cryonic-hibernation of the cryonics patient.”<ref>

In 1922 Alexander Yaroslavsky, member of Russian immortalists-biocosmists movement, wrote "Anabiosys Poem". However, the modern era of cryonics began in 1962 when Michigan college physics teacher [[Robert Ettinger]] proposed in a privately published book, ''The Prospect of Immortality'',<ref>{{cite book | first= Robert C.W. | last= Ettinger|  year= 1964 | title= The Prospect of Immortality| edition= First | publisher= Doubleday|url = http://www.cryonics.org/book1.html | isbn= 0-9743472-3-X}}</ref> that freezing people may be a way to reach future medical technology. (The book was republished in 2005 and remains in print.) Even though freezing a person is apparently fatal, Ettinger argued that what appears to be fatal today may be reversible in the future. He applied the same argument to the process of dying itself, saying that the early stages of [[clinical death]] may be reversible in the future. Combining these two ideas, he suggested that freezing recently deceased people may be a way to save lives. In 1955 Dr. James Lovelock was able to reanimate rats frozen at 0 Celsius using microwave diathermy. <ref> {{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1365902/ pages= 541–546|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=June 28 1955|first1=R.K.|last1=Andjus|first2=J.E|last2=Lovelock|volume128|issue3|title=Reanimation of rats from body temperatures between 0 and 1C by microwave diathermyPMC=1365902}} </ref>

Slightly before Ettinger’s book was complete, Evan Cooper<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.cryonet.org/cgi-bin/dsp.cgi?msg=23124
| title = Ev Cooper
| publisher = cryonet.org
| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}</ref> (writing as Nathan Duhring) privately published a book called ''Immortality: Physically, Scientifically, Now'' that independently suggested the same idea. Cooper founded the Life Extension Society (LES) in 1964 to promote freezing people. Ettinger came to be credited as the originator of cryonics, perhaps because his book was republished by Doubleday in 1964 on recommendation of [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Fred Pohl]], and received more publicity. Ettinger also stayed with the movement longer. Nevertheless, cryonics historian R. Michael Perry has written “Evan Cooper deserves the principal credit for forming an organized cryonics movement.”<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.alcor.org/cryonics/cryonics9208.txt
| title = Cryonics

Cooper’s [[Life Extension Society]] became the seed tree for cryonics societies throughout the country where local cryonics advocates would get together as a result of contact through the LES mailing list. The actual word “cryonics” was invented by Karl Werner, then a student in the studio of William Katavolos at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY, in 1965 in conjunction with the founding of the Cryonics Society of New York (CSNY)<ref name="perry history">{{cite web

This was followed by the founding of the Cryonics Society of Michigan (CSM) and Cryonics Society of California (CSC) in 1966, and Bay Area Cryonics Society (BACS) in 1969 (renamed the [[American Cryonics Society]], or ACS, in 1985). Neither CSNY nor CSC are currently in operation. CSM eventually became the Immortalist Society, a non-profit affiliate of the [[Cryonics Institute]] (CI), a cryonics service organization founded by Ettinger in 1976. Alcor now has more current cryonics patients than any other organization, 110 as of December 2011.<ref>

Although there was at least one earlier aborted case, it is generally accepted that the first person frozen with intent of future resuscitation was Dr. [[James Bedford]], a 73-year-old psychology professor frozen under crude conditions by CSC on January 12, 1967. The case made the cover of a limited print run of ''[[Life Magazine]]'' before the presses were stopped to report the death of three astronauts in the ''[[Apollo 1]]'' fire instead. Bedford is still frozen today at Alcor.<ref name="perry history"/>

Cryonics suffered a major setback in 1979 when it was discovered that nine bodies stored by the head of the CSC, Robert Nelson, in a cemetery in [[Chatsworth, California]], had thawed due to depletion of funds by relatives, after being maintained for a year and a half at the personal expense of Nelson.<ref name="perry history"/><ref>[http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=354 "Mistakes Were Made"], ''[[This American Life]]'', 18 April 2008.</ref> Some of the bodies had apparently thawed years earlier without notification. Nelson was sued, and negative publicity slowed cryonics growth for years afterward. Of 17 documented cryonics cases between 1967 and 1973, only James Bedford remains [[cryopreservation|cryopreserved]] today. Strict financial controls and requirements adopted in response to the Chatsworth scandal have resulted in the successful maintenance of almost all cryonics cases since that era.

The largest cryonics organization today, in terms of membership, was established as a nonprofit organization by [[Fred and Linda Chamberlain]] in 1972 as the Alcor Society for Solid State Hypothermia ([[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|ALCOR]]).<ref name="irs letter">{{cite web

In 1982, the Institute for Advanced Biological Studies (IABS), founded by [[Mike Darwin]] and Steve Bridge in Indiana, merged with Alcor. During the 1980s, Darwin worked with [[UCLA]] cardiothoracic surgery researcher [[Jerry Leaf]] at Alcor to develop a medical model for cryonics procedures. They pioneered the first consistent use of a cryonics procedure now known as a “standby”, in which a team waits to begin life support procedures at the bedside of a cryonics patient as soon as possible after the heart stops.

The oldest incorporated cryonics society still in existence is the [[American Cryonics Society]] (ACS). This [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] [[501(c)(3)]] membership organization was incorporated in 1969 as the Bay Area Cryonics Society (BACS) by a group of cryonics advocates that included two prominent Bay Area physicians, Dr. M. Coleman Harris and Dr. Grace Talbot. The first suspensions under BACS auspices were performed in 1974 by Trans Time, Inc., a for-profit company started by BACS members. BACS researcher Dr. Paul Segall, working with Jerry Leaf of CryoVita, developed a medical model to induce hypothermia shortly after pronouncement of death. Dr. Segall later went on to pioneer blood substitutes for use in both cryonic suspension and in mainstream medicine.

Cryonics received new support in the 1980s when MIT engineer [[Eric Drexler]] started publishing papers and books foreseeing the new field of [[molecular nanotechnology]]. His 1986 book, ''[[Engines of Creation]]'', included an entire chapter on cryonics applications.<ref name="Note7">{{cite book

On July 24, 1988, a Ph.D. in [[computer science]] named Kevin Brown started an [[electronic mailing list]] called ''CryoNet''<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.cryonet.org/
| title = CryoNet
| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}</ref> that became a powerful tool of communication for the cryonics community.

There have been numerous, often transient, for-profit companies involved in cryonics. For-profit companies were often paired or affiliated with non-profit groups they served. Some of these companies, with non-profits they served in parentheses, were Cryonic Interment, Inc. (CSC), Cryo-Span Corporation (CSNY), Cryo-Care Equipment Corporation (CSC and CSNY), Manrise Corporation (Alcor), CryoVita, Inc. (Alcor), BioTransport, Inc. (Alcor), Trans Time, Inc.<ref>{{cite web

The cryonics field seems to have largely consolidated around three non-profit groups, Alcor Life Extension Foundation, Cryonics Institute (CI), and the American Cryonics Society (ACS), all deriving significant income from bequests and donations. A newly formed non-profit group called the Cryonics Society was formally incorporated in 2006 but is devoted solely to promotion and public education of the cryonics concept.

As research in the 1990s revealed in greater detail the damaging effects of freezing, there was a trend to use higher concentrations of glycerol [[cryoprotectant]] to prevent freezing injury. In 2001 Alcor began using [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]], a technology borrowed from mainstream organ preservation research, in an attempt to completely prevent ice formation during cooling. Initially the technology could only be applied to the head when separated from the body. In 2005 Alcor began treating the whole body with their vitrification solution in a procedure called "neurovitrification with whole body cryoprotection".<ref>{{cite web

In June 2005 scientists at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s Safar Center for Resuscitation Research announced they had managed to place [[dog]]s in suspended animation and bring them back to life, most of them without [[brain damage]], by draining the [[blood]] out of the dogs' bodies and injecting a low temperature solution into their [[circulatory system]]s, which in turn keeps the bodies alive in stasis. After three hours of being [[clinically dead]], the dogs' blood was returned to their circulatory systems, and the animals were revived by delivering an [[electric shock]] to their hearts. The heart started pumping the blood around the frozen body, and the dogs were brought back to life.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/magazine/11ideas_section4-21.html |title=Zombie Dogs |first=Stephen |last=Mihm |date=December 11, 2005 |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]}}</ref>

== In popular culture ==
Procedures similar to cryonics have been featured in innumerable science fiction stories as a means to transport a character from the past into the future, or sometimes to aid space travel (in particular [[interstellar travel]]). Often (especially in the former use case), in addition to accomplishing whatever the character's primary task is in the future, he or she must cope with the strangeness of a new world, which may contain only traces of their previous surroundings. This prospect of alienation is often cited as a major reason for the unpopularity of cryonics.

Notable early science fiction short stories featuring human cryopreservation, deliberate or accidental, include [[Lydia Maria Child]]'s short story "Hilda Silfverling, A Fantasy" (1886),<ref>Full text of Lydia Maria Child's "Hilda Silfverling, A Fantasy" short story: [http://faculty.pittstate.edu/~knichols/hilda.html] Accessed March 9, 2010</ref> Jack London's first published work "[[A Thousand Deaths]]" (1899), V. Mayakovsky's "Klop" (1928),<ref>[http://briefly.ru/majakovskij/klop/ Briefly.ru]</ref> H.P. Lovecraft's "[[Cool Air]]" (1928), and Edgar Rice Burroughs' "[[The Resurrection of Jimber-Jaw]]" (1937). The famous comic book super-hero [[Captain America]], popular in the 1940s and discontinued in the 1950s, returned to publication in 1964 with the explanation that he had been accidentally frozen in Arctic ice.<ref name="CapReturn">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller=[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|inker=[[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|story=Captain America Joins...

Ettinger would later write a science fiction story called ''The Penultimate Trump'', published in 1948, in which the explicit idea of cryopreservation of legally dead persons for future repair of medical causes of death is promulgated.<ref>Full text of Ettinger's "Penultimate Trump" short story: [http://www.cryonics.org/Trump.html] Accessed June 8, 2007</ref>

Relatively few stories have been published concerning the primary objective and definition of cryonics, which is medical time travel. The most indepth novel based on contemporary cryonics is national best-seller ''[[The First Immortal]]'' by [[James L. Halperin]] (1998). Other novels include ''[[The Door into Summer]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] (1954), ''[[The Age of the Pussyfoot]]'' by [[Fred Pohl]] (1966) and ''[[Ubik]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]] (1968), ''[[Tomorrow and Tomorrow (novel)|Tomorrow and Tomorrow]]'' by [[Charles Sheffield]] (1997), ''Chiller'' by Sterling Blake (a.k.a. [[Gregory Benford]]) (1993), ''Tech-Heaven'' by [[Linda Nagata]] (1995), ''Ralph’s Journey'' by David Pizer, ''Formerly Brandewyne''<ref>{{cite web | title = Formerly Brandewyne | publisher = Lee Books | year=  1987 | url = http://www.judesplace.com/excerpt.htm }}</ref> by Jude Liebermann, ''Beyond Oblivion'' by Trace Maddox  (2012) and ''I Was a Teenage Popsicle'' by Bev Katz Rosenbaum.<ref>ISBN 0-425-21180-0 
Publisher: Berkley Jam</ref> A fictional book about cryonics specifically for children is ''21st Century Kids'' by [[Shannon Vyff]].<ref>{{cite web | title = 21st Century Kids | publisher = 21CenturyKids  | year=  2007 | url = http://www.21stcenturykidsbook.com/ | accessdate =2007-03-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | authorlink = Shannon Vyff | title = 21st Century Kids | publisher = [[Warren Publishing]] | date=  2007-03-15 | isbn = 1-886057-00-1 | author = Shannon Vyff.}}</ref>

Fictional application of cryonics as rescue after freezing in space has continued since ''The Jameson Satellite'' in 1931. [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' reveals that [[Frank Poole]], murdered by [[HAL 9000]] in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' was cryopreserved by his exposure to space, and found and revived a thousand years later. The [[Larry Niven]] short story "Wait It Out" depicts a sort of emergency self-cryopreservation by men marooned on Pluto. The 1992 Hugo-winning novel ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' by [[Vernor Vinge]] features a protagonist who is resuscitated by a superintelligence, thousands of years after a spaceship accident. [[Stanisław Lem]] described cryonic hibernation during space travel in his novel ''[[The Invincible]]'', and used cryonic preservation (using device named in a way to suggest [[Vitrification in cryopreservation|vitrification]]) as a major plot element in his novel ''[[Fiasco (novel)|Fiasco]]''. Cryonics has also been used in [[Eoin Colfer]]'s ''[[Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code]]'' (referred as "cryogenics" in the book); Domovoi Butler was frozen by [[Artemis Fowl II|Artemis Fowl]] after being shot and then revived magically by [[Captain Holly Short]].<ref>{{AF Cite Book | publisher =Puffin Books | booknumber =3 | year =2006}}</ref>

===Film===
Movies featuring cryonics for medical purposes include the [[Woody Allen]] comedy, ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and the films ''[[Late for Dinner]]'' (1991),<ref>{{cite web

Another movie featuring a cryonics-like process is ''[[Forever Young (1992 film)|Forever Young]]'' (1992), starring Mel Gibson. A "CryoPrison" is where inmates are kept away from society and mentally reformed during their preservation in the film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'' (1993), while cryopreservation is used during space travel in the James Cameron films ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986) and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009). ''[[Pandorum]]'' (2009) features a form of cryopreservation which, upon waking from, subjects are left disoriented, with amnesia lasting anywhere from days to months and, in rare instances, suffering from "Pandorum" (a type of psychosis). ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) involves the test freezing of [[Han Solo]] as proof of concept for suspension, which caused temporary blindness upon his successful revival. Although not about cryonics per se, the [[Ron Howard]] film ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]'' (1985) has been hailed by cryonics advocates as expressing the values motivating cryonics better than any other film.<ref>{{cite book

Low-budget films ("[[B movies]]") featuring cryonics include Frozen Alive (1964), il Fischio Al Naso (Italy) (1969), Frozen Scream (1980), The Chilling (1989), and "[[Nazis at the Center of the Earth]]".

===Television===
On television, cryonics has appeared occasionally since the 1960s.  It was prominently featured in the 1965 opening episode of the space adventure series ''[[Lost in Space]]'', in which a family of space travelers was placed in suspended animation for a five and a half year interstellar journey to a planet of star [[Alpha Centauri]].  The Victorian hero of the 1966 British series ''[[Adam Adamant Lives!]]'' is cryonically suspended by his enemy, and revived in the 1960s. The first story arc of Canadian Soap Opera ''[[Strange Paradise]]'' in 1969 features a reclusive millionaire, Jean Paul Desmond, who has his wife Erica cryonically preserved after her death; episodes featured fictional members of the "Cryonics Society". An episode of ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' called "The Man Who Gambled With Life" was made in mid-1968 and focuses on a dying multi-millionaire who has himself cryonically preserved. Episode 2 of ''[[The Starlost]]'' called "Lazarus From the Mist" features a character who is revived from cryonic suspension in an effort to save the spaceship Ark. In 1977, an episode of ''[[Barney Miller]]'' includes a member of the "Metropolitan New York Cryonic Society".<ref>{{IMDb title|518997|Atomic Bomb}}</ref> Producer [[David E. Kelley]] wrote well-researched portrayals of cryonics for the TV show ''[[L.A. Law]]'' (1990).<ref>{{cite web

Cryonics plays a side role in an episode of mystery drama ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', where a prominent doctor is murdered and the investigation is hampered by a contract he had drawn up to have his body cryogencially preserved for future revival. In the pilot episode of ''[[Misfits of Science]]'' (1985), Arnold "Beef" "Ice Man" Beifneiter is a cryopreserved subject from 1937 who, upon waking, is left simple-minded and with the power to freeze anything he touches, though vulnerable to warmer temperatures and kept cold in an ice cream truck. An episode of ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' includes all four eponymous women cryogenically preserved, but Dorothy, Blanche, and Rose saving only their heads. Sophia, whose body remains intact, informs them they needed "to tip the guy" to be fully preserved. The American television show ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'' features an episode in which the Quincy is baffled by the stabbing murder of a tycoon, only to realize that the murder occurred eight years earlier, and the body was frozen by his colleagues so they could seize his assets. Once the financial work had been done, the body was unfrozen and left for the deceased's biggest enemy to find so that the murder could be pinned on him. On British television, cryonics appears in the last two television works of [[Dennis Potter]], ''[[Karaoke (TV serial)|Karaoke]]'' and ''[[Cold Lazarus]]'' (both 1996), and the long-running series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', as well as its spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]''. Cryonics is also satirized by the American comedy cartoon series ''[[Futurama]]'', with the main character Philip J. Fry accidentally being frozen for 1,000 years to wake up in the year 2999. The title character [[Aang]] in the animated series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' and [[The Last Airbender|its live action film adaptation]] saves himself from drowning in a tempest by creating an ice bubble, preserving him for about a hundred years. In a 2000 episode of the syndicated series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', the characters ''[[Xena]]'' and Gabrielle fake their own deaths only to be mistakenly entombed in an icy cave, where they are preserved for 25 years until an avalanche frees them. ''[[Aurora(telenovela)|Aurora]]'', a Spanish-based telenovela by Telemundo deals with cryonics. A 20 year-old-woman is frozen and revived 20 years later, to fall in love with the son of her past love.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msnlatino.telemundo.com/novelas/Aurora |title=Novela Aurora, con Eugenio Siller, Jorge Luis Pila, Aylin Mujica, Sara Maldonado, Fotos, videos, novela por Telemundo &#124; Telemundo |publisher=Msnlatino.telemundo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref> The title character in "[[Cleopatra 2525]]", a syndicated US television series, is an exotic dancer who experiences complications during breast augmentation surgery and is cryopreserved for 525 years. The character "Bramwell" is the sole survivor of a cyrogenic-suspended military mission in the episode ''[[Black Light]]'' of the US syndicated Canadian SF TV series ''[[Starhunter]]''. Bramwell's memory and reasoning have been damaged by a flaw in his re-animation and is determined to lead an attack on an "enemy world" in a war settled long since his entry into cryogenic suspension.<ref>www.imdb.com/title/tt0709286/</ref>

===Gaming===
The role-playing game ''[[The Morrow Project]]'' (1980) features players playing groups of teams cryonically frozen just prior to a global thermonuclear war for the purpose of rebuilding society. In the 1999 video game ''[[Homeworld]]'', the native residents of the planet Kharak use cryogenic preservation to preserve and store hundred of thousands of people in 'cryo trays' for transport aboard the Mothership, a large colony ship to take them to their ancestral homeworld, Hiigara. In the 2001 video game ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', Master Chief is woken from cryo as the Covenant attacks his ship. Also, ''Halo 3'''s ending shows Chief and Cortana trapped in a ship as the Chief goes into cryo after telling Cortana to "Wake me when you need me." In the most recent ''Halo 4'', Chief awakens after being in cryo for four years.

===Famous people===
The most famous known cryopreserved patient is baseball player [[Ted Williams]]. The popular [[urban legend]] that [[Walt Disney]] was cryopreserved is false; he was cremated and interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/disney/info/wd-ice.htm Snopes.com]</ref> [[Robert A. Heinlein]], who wrote enthusiastically of the concept in ''[[The Door into Summer]]'', was cremated and had his ashes distributed over the Pacific Ocean. [[Timothy Leary]] was a long-time cryonics advocate, and signed up with a major cryonics provider. He changed his mind, however, shortly before his death, and so was not cryopreserved.
