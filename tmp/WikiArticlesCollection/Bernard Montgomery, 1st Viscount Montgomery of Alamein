[[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein''', [[Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Companion of the Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Privy Counsellor (United Kingdom)|PC]] ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|n|t|ˈ|ɡ|ʌ|m|ər|ɪ|_|ə|v|_|ˈ|æ|l|ə|m|eɪ|n}}; 17 November 1887&nbsp;– 24 March 1976), nicknamed '''"Monty"''' and the '''"Spartan General"''',<ref>{{cite book|last=Various Authors|title=Illustrated Story of World War II|year=1969|publisher=The Reader's Digest Association, inc.|isbn=0-89577-029-6|page=284}}</ref>  was a [[British Army]] officer.

He saw action in the First World War, where he was seriously wounded, and during the Second World War he commanded the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] from August 1942 in the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] until the final Allied victory in Tunisia. This command included the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]], a turning point in the [[Western Desert Campaign]]. He subsequently commanded the Eighth Army in Sicily and [[Italy]] before being given responsibility for planning the D-Day invasion in Normandy. He was in command of all Allied ground forces during [[Operation Overlord]] from the initial landings until after the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]]. He then continued in command of the [[21st Army Group]] for the rest of the campaign in North West Europe. As such he was the principal field commander for [[Operation Market Garden|the failed airborne attempt to bridge the Rhine]] at [[Arnhem]] and the [[Operation Plunder|Allied Rhine crossing]]. On 4 May 1945 he took the [[German surrender at Lüneburg Heath]] in northern Germany. After the war he became Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) in Germany and then [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]].

==Early life==
Montgomery was born in [[Kennington]], London, in 1887, the fourth child of nine, to an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest, the [[Reverend]] [[Henry Montgomery (bishop)|Henry Montgomery]], and his wife, Maud (née Farrar). Henry Montgomery, Vicar of St Mark's, Kennington, at that time, was the second son of the noted [[Indian Civil Service|Indian civilian]] [[Robert Montgomery (administrator)|Sir Robert Montgomery]], who died a month after his grandson's birth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of National Biography |volume=XXXVIII |last=Hamilton (entry author) |page=324}}</ref> He was probably a descendant of [[Alexander Montgomery (1686–1729)|Colonel Alexander Montgomery]] (1686–1729).<ref name="Escutcheon">{{citation|url=http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cuhags/escutcheon/09.3.pdf|author=Rogers, Nicholas|title=Book Review – Hugh Montgomery, The Montgomery Millennium, London-Berlin-Tokyo: Megatrend International Expert Consortium Ltd, 2002|journal=The Escutcheon: The Journal of the Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society|volume=9|issue=3|year=2004}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Bernard's mother, Maud, was the daughter of the preacher [[Frederic William Farrar]] and was eighteen years younger than her husband.<ref>Hamilton, p. 3 (1981)</ref> After the death of Sir Robert Montgomery, Henry inherited the Montgomery ancestral estate of New Park at [[Moville]] in northern [[County Donegal]]. However, there was still £13,000 to pay on a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]], a large debt in the 1880s, and Henry was at the time still only a parish priest. Despite selling off all the farms that were at Ballynally, "there was barely enough to keep up New Park and pay for the blasted summer holiday" (i.e., at New Park).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bishop Montgomery |last=Montgomery|isbn=| page=}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2013}} It was a financial relief of some magnitude when, in 1889, Henry was made [[Diocese of Tasmania|Bishop of Tasmania]], then still a British colony, and Bernard spent his formative years here. The bishop considered it his duty to spend as much time as possible in the rural areas of Tasmania and was away for up to six months at a time. While he was away, his wife, still in her mid-twenties, gave her children "constant" beatings,<ref>Hamilton, p. 31 (1981)</ref> then ignored them most of the time as she performed the public duties of the bishop's wife. Of Bernard's siblings, Sibyl died prematurely in Tasmania, and Harold, Donald and Una all emigrated.<ref>Hamilton, p. 5 (1981)</ref> Maud Montgomery took little active interest in the education of her young children other than to have them taught by tutors brought from England. The loveless environment made Bernard something of a bully, as he himself later recalled "I was a dreadful little boy. I don't suppose anybody would put up with my sort of behaviour these days."<ref>Chalfont, p. 29 (1976)</ref> Later in life Montgomery refused to allow his son [[David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|David]] to have anything to do with his grandmother and also refused to attend her funeral in 1949.<ref>Bierman & Smith (2002), p. 223</ref>

The family returned to England once for a [[Lambeth Conference]] in 1897, and Bernard and his brother Harold were educated for a term at [[The King's School, Canterbury]].<ref>Hamilton (1981), p. 36</ref> In 1901, Bishop Montgomery became secretary of the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]], and the family returned to London. Montgomery attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] and then the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], from which he was almost expelled for rowdiness and violence.<ref name=heath213>Heathcote, p. 213</ref> On graduation in September 1908 he was commissioned into the 1st Battalion [[The Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers|The Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] as a second lieutenant,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28178| startpage=6762|date=18 September 1908|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> and first saw overseas service later that year in [[British India|India]].<ref name=heath213/> He was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] in 1910,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=28382|startpage=3996|date=7 June 1910|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> and in 1912 became adjutant of the 1st Battalion of his regiment at [[Shorncliffe Army Camp]].<ref name=heath213/>

==First World War==
[[File:Montgomery First World War.jpg|thumb|left|Captain Bernard Montgomery DSO with a fellow officer of [[104th Brigade (United Kingdom)|104th Brigade]], [[35th Division (United Kingdom)|35th Division]], with which he served from January 1915 until early 1917]]
The First World War began in August 1914 and Montgomery moved to France with his regiment that month.<ref name=heath213/> He saw action at the [[Battle of Le Cateau]] that month and during the retreat from [[Battle of Mons|Mons]].<ref name=heath213/> At [[Méteren]], near the Belgian border at [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]] on 13 October 1914, during an Allied counter-offensive, he was shot through the right [[human lung|lung]] by a sniper.<ref name=heath213/> Montgomery was hit once more though, in the knee.<ref>Bierman & Smith, p. 224 (2002)</ref> He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for gallant leadership: the citation for this award, published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' in December 1914 reads:{{quote|align=center|Conspicuous gallant leading on 13th October, when he turned the enemy out of their trenches with the bayonet.

After recovering in early 1915, he was appointed to be [[brigade major]]<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=29080| startpage=1833|date=23 February 1915|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> first of [[112th Brigade (United Kingdom)|112th Brigade]] and then with [[104th Brigade (United Kingdom)|104th Brigade]] under training in [[Lancashire]].<ref name=heath214>Heathcote, p. 214</ref> He returned to the Western Front in early 1916 as a general staff officer in the [[33rd Division (United Kingdom)|33rd Division]] and took part in the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] in April / May 1917.<ref name=heath214/> He became a general staff officer with [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]], part of General Sir [[Herbert Plumer]]'s Second Army, in July 1917.<ref name=heath214/>

Montgomery served at the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in Autumn 1917 before finishing the war as General Staff Officer 1 and effectively chief of staff of the [[British 47th (2nd London) Division|47th (2nd London) Division]],<ref name=heath214/> with the temporary rank of [[lieutenant-colonel]].<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=30884| startpage=10505|date=3 September 1918|supp=y|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> A photograph from October 1918, reproduced in many biographies, shows the then unknown Lt.-Col.

==Between the world wars==
After the First World War Montgomery commanded the 17th Battalion the [[Royal Fusiliers]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31585|startpage=12398|supp=y|date=3 October 1919|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> a battalion in the [[British Army of the Rhine]], before reverting to his substantive rank of [[captain (OF-2)|captain]] (brevet major) in November 1919.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31799|startpage=2406|supp=y|date=27 February 1920|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> He then attended the army's [[Staff College, Camberley]], before being appointed [[Brigade Major]] in the 17th Infantry Brigade in January 1921.<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=32207|startpage=760|supp=y|date=26 January 1921|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> The brigade was stationed in [[County Cork]] carrying out counter-insurgency operations during the final stages of the [[Irish War of Independence]].<ref name=heath214/> Montgomery came to the conclusion that the conflict could not be won without harsh measures, and that self-government was the only feasible solution; in 1923, after the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] and during the [[Irish Civil War]], Montgomery wrote to Colonel [[Arthur Percival]] of the [[Essex Regiment]]:
{{quote|Personally, my whole attention was given to defeating the rebels but it never bothered me a bit how many houses were burnt. I think I regarded all civilians as 'Shinners' and I never had any dealings with any of them. My own view is that to win a war of this sort, you must be ruthless. [[Oliver Cromwell]], or the Germans, would have settled it in a very short time. Nowadays public opinion precludes such methods, the nation would never allow it, and the politicians would lose their jobs if they sanctioned it. That being so, I consider that [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] was right in what he did, if we had gone on we could probably have squashed the rebellion as a temporary measure, but it would have broken out again like an ulcer the moment we removed the troops. I think the rebels would probably [have] refused battles, and hidden their arms etc. until we had gone.<ref>Sheehan. ''British Voices'', pp. 151–52</ref>}}

In May 1923, Montgomery was posted to the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial]] [[British 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division|49th Division]].<ref name=heath214/> He returned to the 1st Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1925 as a company commander.<ref name=heath214/> In January 1926 having been promoted to major in July 1925,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33083| startpage=5972|date=11 September 1925|accessdate =24 October 2009}}</ref> he was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant General at the [[Staff College, Camberley]] in the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=33128| startpage=691|date=29 January 1926 |accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> a position he held until January 1929 by which time he had been made a ([[brevet (military)|brevet]] lieutenant-colonel).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33460|startpage=617|date=25 January 1929 |accessdate =24 October 2009}}</ref>

In 1927, he met and married [[Elizabeth Carver]], née Hobart, widow of [[Oswald Carver]], Olympic rowing medalist who was killed in the First World War.<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p21864.htm#i218639 the Peerage,com]</ref> Their son, [[David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|David]], was born in August 1928.<ref name=heath214/> Elizabeth Carver was the sister of the Second World War commander [[Percy Hobart]].<ref name=heath214/>

On completion of his tour of duty in India, Montgomery returned to Britain in June 1937<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=34426| startpage=5181|date=13 August 1937|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> where he became commanding officer of the 9th Infantry Brigade with the temporary rank of [[brigadier]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34426|startpage=5178|date=13 August 1937|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> but that year saw great tragedy when his wife was bitten by an insect while on holiday in [[Burnham-on-Sea]].

==Second World War==

===British Expeditionary Force===

====Retreat To Dunkirk and Evacuation====
{{See also|World War II}}
Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. The 3rd Division was deployed to Belgium as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF). During this time, Montgomery faced serious trouble from his military superiors and the clergy for his frank attitude regarding the sexual health of his soldiers, but was defended from dismissal by his superior [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], commander of [[British II Corps|II Corps]].<ref>Heathcote 1999, p218,</ref> Montgomery's training paid off when the Germans began their invasion of the [[Low Countries]] on 10 May 1940 and the 3rd Division advanced to the River [[Dijle]] and then withdrew to [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]] with great professionalism, entering the Dunkirk perimeter in a famous night-time march which placed his forces on the left flank which had been left exposed by the Belgian surrender.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lord|first=Walter|title=The Miracle of Dunkirk|year=1999|publisher=TheViking Press|location=London|isbn=1-85326-685-X}}</ref> The 3rd Division returned to Britain intact with minimal casualties. During [[Operation Dynamo]] — the evacuation of 330,000 BEF and French troops to Britain — Montgomery assumed command of the [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]].<ref name=heath216>Heathcote, p. 216</ref>

On his return Montgomery antagonised the [[War Office]] with trenchant criticisms of the command of the BEF<ref>Bierman & Smith, p. 228 (2002)</ref> and was briefly relegated to divisional command. He was however made a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]]. In July 1940, he was appointed acting [[lieutenant-general]],<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=34909| startpage=4660| endpage=| supp=y |date=26 July 1940 |accessdate =24 October 2009}}</ref> placed in command of [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]], responsible for the defence of [[Hampshire]] and [[Dorset]], and started a long-running feud with the new commander-in-chief, Southern Command, [[Claude Auchinleck]].<ref>Bierman & Smith, pp. 229–30 (2002)</ref> In April 1941, he became commander of [[British XII Corps|XII Corps]] responsible for the defence of [[Kent]].<ref name=heath216/> During this period he instituted a regime of continuous training and insisted on high levels of physical fitness for both officers and other ranks. He was ruthless in sacking officers he considered would be unfit for command in action.<ref name="Mead303">Mead, p. 303.</ref> Promoted to temporary lieutenant-general in July,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=35224| startpage=4202| endpage=| supp=y |date=22 July 1941 |accessdate =24 October 2009}}</ref> in December Montgomery was given command of [[Aldershot Command|South-Eastern Command]]<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=35397| startpage=7369|date=26 December 1941| supp=y| accessdate =26 March 2009}}</ref> overseeing the defence of Kent, [[Sussex]] and [[Surrey]].<ref name="Mead303"/> He renamed his command the South-Eastern Army to promote offensive spirit. During this time he further developed and rehearsed his ideas and trained his soldiers, culminating in [[Exercise Tiger (1942)|Exercise Tiger]] in May 1942, a combined forces [[Military exercise|exercise]] involving 100,000 troops.<ref>Stacey, Charles P.

===North Africa and Italy===

====Montgomery's early command====
{{See also|North African Campaign|Western Desert Campaign|Tunisia Campaign|Italian Campaign (World War II)}}
[[File:Montgomery watches his tanks move up.jpg|thumb|Montgomery in a [[M3 Lee|Grant]] tank in North Africa, November 1942]]

In 1942, a new field commander was required in the Middle East, where Auchinleck was fulfilling both the role of commander-in-chief [[Middle East Command]] and commander [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]. He had stabilised the Allied position at the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], but after a visit in August 1942, the Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]], replaced him as C-in-C with [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Alexander]] and [[William Gott]] as commander of the Eighth Army in the [[Western Desert campaign|Western Desert]]. After Gott was killed flying back to [[Cairo]] Churchill was persuaded by Brooke, who by this time was [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], to appoint Montgomery, who had only just been nominated to replace Alexander as commander of the British ground forces for [[Operation Torch]].<ref>Playfair, Vol. III, pp. 367–369.</ref>

A story, probably apocryphal but popular at the time, is that the appointment caused Montgomery to remark that "After having an easy war, things have now got much more difficult." A colleague is supposed to have told him to cheer up – at which point Montgomery is supposed to have said "I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about Rommel!"<ref>Churchill, p. 420. According to J. Toland, ''Battle: The Story of the Bulge'', 1959, p. 157, this conversation was with Churchill's chief of staff [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay]], beginning with Montgomery saying to Ismay, "It's a sad thing that a professional soldier can reach the peak of generalship and then suffer a reverse which ruins his career."</ref>

Montgomery's assumption of command transformed the fighting spirit and abilities of the Eighth Army.<ref name="Playfair370">Playfair, Vol. III, p. 370.</ref> Taking command on 13 August 1942, he immediately became a whirlwind of activity. He ordered the creation of the [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]], which contained all armoured divisions to fight alongside his [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] which was all infantry divisions. This was in no way similar to a German Panzer Corps. One of Rommel's Panzer Corps combined infantry, armour and artillery units under one corps commander. The only common commander for Montgomery's all infantry and all armour corps was the Eighth Army Commander himself. [[Correlli Barnett]] commented that Montgomery's solution "...&nbsp;was in every way opposite to Auchinleck's and in every way wrong, for it carried the existing dangerous separatism still further."<ref>Barnett, p. 265</ref> Montgomery reinforced the {{convert|30|mi|km}} long front line at El Alamein, something that would take two months to accomplish. He asked Alexander to send him two new British divisions (51st Highland and 44th) that were then arriving in Egypt and were scheduled to be deployed in defence of the Nile Delta. He moved his field HQ to Burg al Arab, close to the Air Force command post in order better to coordinate combined operations.<ref name="Playfair370"/> Montgomery was determined that the Army, Navy and Air Forces should fight their battles in a unified, focused manner according to a detailed plan. He ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa, just behind his own lines, expecting the German commander, [[Erwin Rommel]], to attack with the heights as his objective, something that Rommel soon did. Montgomery ordered all contingency plans for retreat to be destroyed. "I have cancelled the plan for withdrawal", he told his officers at the first meeting he held with them in the desert. "If we are attacked, then there will be no retreat. If we cannot stay here alive, then we will stay here dead."<ref name="Moorehead118-127">Moorehead, Alan, ''Montgomery'', pp. 118–27 (1946)</ref>

Montgomery made a great effort to appear before troops as often as possible, frequently visiting various units and making himself known to the men, often arranging for cigarettes to be distributed. Although he still wore a standard British officer's cap on arrival in the desert, he briefly wore an Australian broad-brimmed hat before switching to wearing the black beret (with the badge of the Royal Tank Regiment next to the British General Officer's badge) for which he became notable. The black beret was offered to him by Jim Fraser whilst the latter was driving him on an inspection tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/27/jim-fraser-obituary|title=Jim Fraser obituary|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 May 2013|accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> Both Brooke and Alexander were astonished by the transformation in atmosphere when they visited on 19 August, less than a week after Montgomery had taken command.<ref name="Moorehead118-127" />

====First battles with Rommel====
[[File:Animals in War 1939-1945 B6541.jpg|thumbnail|left|General Montgomery with his pets, the puppies 'Hitler' (left) and 'Rommel', France (Date unknown)]]
Rommel attempted to turn the left flank of the Eighth Army at the [[Battle of Alam Halfa]] from 31 August 1942. The German/Italian armoured Corps infantry attack was stopped in very heavy fighting. Rommel's forces had to withdraw urgently lest their retreat through the British minefields be cut off.<ref>Winston Churchill, The Second World War, v.4 pp.  546–48</ref> Montgomery was criticised for not counter-attacking the retreating forces immediately, but he felt strongly that his methodical build-up of British forces was not yet ready. A hasty counter-attack risked ruining his strategy for an offensive on his own terms in late October, planning for which had begun soon after he took command.<ref>Playfair, Vol. III, p. 388.</ref> He was confirmed in the permanent rank of lieutenant-general in mid October.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35746|startpage=4481|supp=y|date=13 October 1942|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref>
The conquest of Libya was essential for airfields to support [[Malta]] and to threaten the rear of Axis forces opposing [[Operation Torch]]. Montgomery prepared meticulously for the new offensive after convincing Churchill that the time was not being wasted. (Churchill sent a telegram to Alexander on 23 September 1942 which began, "We are in your hands and of course a victorious battle makes amends for much delay."<ref>Churchill, p. 588</ref>) He was determined not to fight until he thought there had been sufficient preparation for a decisive victory, and put into action his beliefs with the gathering of resources, detailed planning, the training of troops—especially in clearing minefields and fighting at night<ref>Playfair, Vol IV, pp. 13–14.</ref>—and in the use of 252<ref>Playfair, Vol IV, p. 9.</ref> of the latest American-built [[Sherman tank]]s, 90 [[M7 Priest]] self-propelled howitzers, and making a personal visit to every unit involved in the offensive. By the time the offensive was ready in late October, Eighth Army had 231,000 men on its ration strength.<ref>Playfair, Vol. IV, p. 16.</ref>

====El Alamein====
[[File:El Alamein 1942 - British infantry.jpg|thumb|right|9th Australian Infantry Division in a posed photograph during the Second Battle of El Alamein. (Photographer: Len Chetwyn)]]
<!-- Do not confuse this photo (E 18474) with another (E 18908). -->
The [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] began on 23 October 1942, and ended 12 days later with the first large-scale, decisive Allied land victory of the war. Montgomery correctly predicted both the length of the battle and the number of casualties (13,500<ref>Playfair, Vol. IV, p. 78.</ref>). However, soon after Allied armoured units and infantry broke through the German and Italian lines and were pursuing the enemy forces at speed along the coast road, a violent rainstorm burst over the region, bogging down the tanks and support trucks in the desert mud. Montgomery, standing before his officers at headquarters and close to tears, announced that he was forced to call off the pursuit. Corelli Barnett has pointed out that the rain also fell on the Germans, and that the weather is therefore an inadequate explanation for the failure to exploit the breakthrough, but nevertheless the Battle of El Alamein had been a great success. Over 30,000<ref>Playfair, Vol. IV, p. 79.</ref> prisoners were taken including the German second in command, [[Ritter von Thoma|General von Thoma]], as well as eight other general officers.<ref>Moorehead, pp. 140–41</ref> Rommel, having been in a hospital in Germany at the start of the battle, was forced to return on 25 October 1942 after [[Georg Stumme|General Stumme]] – his replacement as German commander – died of a heart attack in the early hours of the battle.<ref>Churchill, p. 591</ref>

====Tunisia====
Montgomery was advanced to [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] and promoted to full [[General (United Kingdom)|general]].<ref name="KCB+Gen"/> He kept the initiative, applying superior strength when it suited him, forcing Rommel out of each successive defensive position. On 6 March 1943, Rommel's attack on the over-extended Eighth Army at [[Medenine]] ([[Operation Capri]]) with the largest concentration of German armour in North Africa was successfully repulsed.<ref>Stout (1956), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Medi-c11-3.html Chapter 11&mdash;Tunisia. The Battle of Medenine]</ref> At the [[Mareth Line]], 20 to 27 March, when Montgomery encountered fiercer frontal opposition than he had anticipated, he switched his major effort into an outflanking inland pincer, backed by low-flying [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighter-bomber support.<ref name=odnb>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31460?docPos=1|title=Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> For his role in North Africa he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] by the United States government in the rank of Chief Commander.<ref name="LM"/>

====Sicily====
[[File:Gen. Bernard Law Montgomery and Lt. Gen. George S. Patton, Jr.,.jpg|thumb|left|Montgomery visits Patton in Palermo, Sicily, July 1943]]
The next major Allied attack was the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] (Operation Husky). Montgomery considered the initial plans for the Allied invasion, which had been agreed in principle by Eisenhower and Alexander, to be unworkable because of the dispersion of effort. He managed to have the plans recast to concentrate the Allied forces, having Patton's Seventh US Army land in the Gulf of Gela (on the left flank of Eighth Army, which landed around Syracuse in the south-east of Sicily) rather than near Palermo in the west and north of Sicily.<ref>Mead, p. 306.</ref> Inter-Allied tensions grew as the American commanders [[George S. Patton|Patton]] and [[Omar Bradley|Bradley]] (then commanding II US Corps under Patton), took umbrage at what they perceived as Montgomery's attitudes and boastfulness.<ref name=odnb/>

====Italian Campaign====
[[File:Montgomery E010786478-v8.jpg|thumb|right|Wartime colour photograph of Montgomery with his [[Miles Messenger]] aircraft (location and date unknown)]]
During the autumn of 1943, Montgomery continued to command the Eighth Army during the [[Allied invasion of Italy|landings on the mainland of Italy itself]].<ref name=heath217>Heathcote, p. 217</ref> In conjunction with the Anglo-American landings at Salerno (near Naples) by [[Mark Wayne Clark|Mark Clark]]'s [[United States Fifth Army|Fifth Army]] and seaborne landings by British paratroops in the heel of Italy (including the key port of Taranto, where they disembarked without resistance directly into the port), Montgomery led the Eighth Army up the toe of Italy.<ref name=heath217/> Montgomery abhorred the lack of coordination, the dispersion of effort, and the strategic muddle and opportunism he perceived in the Allied effort in Italy and was glad to leave the "dog's breakfast" on 23 December 1943.<ref name=odnb/>

===Normandy===
{{See also|Invasion of Normandy}}
[[File:Simonds.jpg|left|thumb|Montgomery with officers of the [[First Canadian Army]]. From left, Major-General [[Christopher Vokes|Vokes]], General [[Harry Crerar|Crerar]], Field Marshal Montgomery, Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks|Horrocks]], Lieutenant-General [[Guy Simonds|Simonds]], Major-General Spry, and Major-General [[Bruce Matthews (Canadian Army officer)|Mathews]]]]
Montgomery returned to Britain in January 1944.<ref>Hart, p. 8</ref> He was assigned to command the [[21st Army Group]] which consisted of all Allied ground forces that would take part in [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of [[Normandy]] under overall direction of the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref name=heath217/> At [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] on 7 April and 15 May he presented his strategy for the invasion. He envisaged a ninety day battle, ending when all the forces reached the [[Seine]], pivoting on an Allied-held [[Caen]], with British and Canadian armies forming a shoulder to attract and defeat the main German counter-attacks, while the US armies took the Cherbourg peninsula and Brittany, wheeling south and then east on the right.<ref name=odnb/>

During the hard fought two and a half month [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] that followed, the impact of a series of unfavourable autumnal weather conditions disrupted the Normandy landing areas.<ref name=odnb/> Montgomery's initial plan was to break out immediately towards [[Caen]]. Unable to do so, as the British did not get enough forces ashore to exploit the successful landing, Montgomery's advance was checked. Montgomery continued to follow his plan for the invasion by attracting and holding German counter-attacks in the area north of Caen, which was designed to allow the United States Army in the west to take Cherbourg. Hampered by stormy weather and the [[bocage]] terrain, Montgomery had to ensure Rommel focused on the British in the east rather than the Americans in the west, who had to take the Cotentin Peninsula and Brittany before the Germans could be trapped by a general swing east. By the middle of July Caen had been taken, as Rommel continued to prioritise prevention of the break-out by British forces rather than the western territories being taken by the Americans. This was broadly as Montgomery had planned, albeit not with the same speed as he outlined at St Paul's. An American break-out was achieved with Operation Cobra and the encirclement of German forces in the [[Falaise pocket]] at the cost of British sacrifice with the diversionary [[Operation Goodwood]].<ref>D'Este, p. 202 (1983)</ref>

===Advance to the Rhine===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-14059-0018, Berlin, Oberbefehlshaber der vier Verbündeten.jpg|thumb|right|The Supreme Commanders on 5 June 1945 in Berlin:

The increasing presence of American troops in the European theatre (from five out of ten divisions at [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] to 72 out of 85 in 1945) made it a political impossibility for the Ground Forces Commander to be British. After the end of the Normandy campaign, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] took over Ground Forces Command on 1 September, while continuing as Supreme Commander, with Montgomery continuing to command the 21st Army Group, now consisting mainly of British and Canadian units. Montgomery bitterly resented this change, although it had been agreed before the D-Day invasion.<ref name="Weigley, Russell F. 1945, page 253">Weigley, p. 253</ref> [[Winston Churchill]] had Montgomery promoted to [[field marshal]]<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=36680| startpage=4055| endpage=| supp=y |date=29 August 1944 |accessdate =24 October 2009}}</ref> by way of compensation.<ref name="Weigley, Russell F. 1945, page 253"/>

Montgomery was able to persuade Eisenhower to adopt his strategy of a single thrust to the [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr]] with [[Operation Market Garden]] in September 1944. It was uncharacteristic of Montgomery's battles: the offensive was strategically bold but poorly planned. Montgomery either did not receive or ignored [[Ultra (cryptography)|ULTRA]] intelligence which warned of the presence of German armoured units near the site of the attack.<ref name="Lanning" />

When the surprise attack on the Ardennes took place on 16 December 1944, starting the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the front of the [[U.S. 12th Army Group]] was split, with the bulk of the [[U.S. First Army]] being on the northern shoulder of the German 'bulge'. The Army Group commander, General [[Omar Bradley]], was located south of the penetration at [[Luxembourg]] and command of the U.S. First Army became problematic. Montgomery was the nearest commander on the ground and on 20 December, Eisenhower (who was in [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]]) transferred [[Courtney Hodges]]' U.S. First Army and [[William Hood Simpson|William Simpson]]'s [[U.S. Ninth Army]] to his 21st Army Group, despite Bradley's vehement objections on national grounds.{{#tag:ref|For a full discussion see {{Cite book|title=United States Army in World War II.

Winter Counteroffensives|location=Washington DC|id=CMH Pub. 7-1}}|group=nb}} Montgomery grasped the situation quickly, visiting all divisional, corps, and army field commanders himself and instituting his '[[GHQ Liaison Regiment|Phantom]]' network of liaison officers. He grouped the [[British XXX Corps]] as a strategic reserve behind the Meuse and reorganised the US defence of the northern shoulder, shortening and strengthening the line and ordering the evacuation of [[Sankt Vith|St Vith]]. The German commander of the 5th Panzer Army, [[Hasso von Manteuffel]] said:
<blockquote>The operations of the American 1st Army had developed into a series of individual holding actions. Montgomery's contribution to restoring the situation was that he turned a series of isolated actions into a coherent battle fought according to a clear and definite plan. It was his refusal to engage in premature and piecemeal counter-attacks which enabled the Americans to gather their reserves and frustrate the German attempts to extend their breakthrough.<ref>Patrick Delaforce, ''The Battle of the Bulge – Hitler's Final Gamble'' {{Page needed|date=December 2008}} (2004)</ref>

Montgomery's 21st Army Group advanced to the Rhine with operations [[Operation Veritable|Veritable]] and [[Operation Grenade|Grenade]] in February 1945. A meticulously planned [[Operation Plunder|Rhine crossing]] occurred on 24 March. While successful it was weeks after the Americans had unexpectedly captured the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] and crossed the river. Montgomery's river crossing was followed by the [[Ruhr Pocket|encirclement]] of the German [[Army Group B]] in the [[Ruhr]]. Initially Montgomery's role was to guard the flank of the American advance. This was altered, however, to forestall any chance of a [[Red Army]] advance into Denmark, and the 21st Army Group occupied [[Hamburg]] and [[Rostock]] and sealed off the [[Denmark|Danish]] peninsula.<ref name=odnb/> On 4 May 1945, on [[Lüneburg Heath]], Montgomery accepted the [[German surrender at Lüneburg Heath|Surrender of German forces in north-west Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands]].<ref name=heath218>Heathcote, p. 218</ref>

After the war Montgomery became the C-in-C of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), the name given to the British Occupation Forces and the British member of the Allied Control Council.<ref name="Mead309">Mead, p. 309.</ref> He was created 1st [[Viscount Montgomery of Alamein]] in 1946.<ref name=viscount>{{London Gazette|issue=37407|startpage=1|supp=y|date=28 December 1945|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> He was [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] from 1946 until 1948, succeeding Alanbrooke, but was largely a failure as it required strategic and political skills he did not possess. He was barely on speaking terms with his fellow chiefs, sending his VCIGS to attend their meetings<ref name="Mead309"/> and he clashed particularly with [[Arthur Tedder]], who as Deputy Supreme Commander had intrigued for Montgomery's dismissal during the Battle of Normandy, and who was by now [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]]. When Montgomery's term of office expired, Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] appointed General (later Field-Marshal) [[William Slim]] as his successor; when Montgomery protested that he had told his protégé [[John Crocker]], a former corps commander from the 1944-5 campaign, that the job was to be his, Attlee is said to have given the memorable retort "Untell him".<ref>Mead, p. 109.</ref>

He was then appointed Chairman of the [[Western European Union]]'s commanders-in-chief committee.<ref name="Mead309"/> Volume 3 of Nigel Hamilton's ''Life of Montgomery of Alamein'' gives a good account of the bickering between Montgomery and his land forces chief, a French general, which created splits through the Union headquarters. He was thus pleased to become Eisenhower's deputy in creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|European]] forces in 1951.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=39352|startpage=5221|supp=y|date=9 October 1951|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> He was an effective inspector-general and mounted good exercises, but out of his depth politically. He continued to serve under Eisenhower's successors, [[Matthew Ridgway]] and [[Alfred Gruenther|Al Gruenther]], until his retirement, aged nearly 71, in 1958.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=41508|startpage=5954|supp=y|date=26 September 1958|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> His mother died in 1949; Montgomery did not attend the funeral, claiming he was "too busy".<ref name=odnb/> 

He was chairman of the governing body of [[St. John's School, Leatherhead]] from 1951 to 1966, and a generous supporter. Montgomery was an Honorary Member of the [[Winkle Club]], a noted charity in Hastings, East Sussex, and introduced [[Winston Churchill]] to the club in 1955.<ref>[http://www.wpafilmlibrary.com/detail/sir_winston_gets_the_winkle_fishermen_of_hastings_old_town_make_sir_winston_churchill_a_member_of_winkle_club/2215a667-8af7-7d60-c557-8fe40541633d.html "Sir Winston Churchill Gets The Winkle In Ceremony at Hastings."

In 1953, the Hamilton Board of Education in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada, wrote to Montgomery and asked permission to name a new school in the city's east end after him. Viscount Montgomery Elementary was billed as "the most modern school in North America" and the largest single-storey school in Hamilton, when the sod was turned on 14 March 1951. The school officially opened on 18 April 1953, with Montgomery in attendance among almost 10,000 well-wishers. At the opening, he gave the motto "Gardez Bien" from his own family's [[coat of arms]].<ref name=school>{{cite web|url=http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/viscountmontgomery/history.asp |title=History of Viscount Montgomery School|publisher=Viscount Montgomery School|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> Montgomery referred to the school as his "beloved school" and visited on five separate occasions, the last being in 1960.

Montgomery's memoirs (1958) criticised many of his wartime comrades in harsh terms, including Eisenhower, whom he accused, among other things, of prolonging the war by a year through poor leadership — allegations which ended their friendship, not least as Eisenhower was still US President at the time. He was threatened with legal action by Field-Marshal Auchinleck for suggesting that Auchinleck had intended to retreat from the Alamein position if attacked again, and had to give a radio broadcast (20 November 1958) expressing his gratitude to Auchinleck for having stabilised the front at the First Battle of Alamein. The 1960 paperback edition of his memoirs contains a publisher's note drawing attention to that broadcast, and stating that in the publisher's view the reader might reasonably assume from Montgomery's text that Auchinleck had been planning to retreat "into the Nile Delta or beyond" and pointing out that it had been Auchinleck's intention to launch an offensive as soon as Eighth Army was "rested and regrouped".<ref>Montgomery 1960, p14</ref> Montgomery was stripped of his honorary citizenship of [[Montgomery, Alabama]], and was challenged to a duel by an Italian officer.<ref>''La Repubblica'', 22 February 1992 the challenge actually came from Vincenzo Caputo, a Sicilian lawyer.</ref>

He twice met with [[Israel]]i general [[Moshe Dayan]]. After an initial meeting in the early 1950s, Montgomery met Dayan again in the 1960s to discuss the [[Vietnam War]], which Dayan was studying. Montgomery was harshly critical of US strategy in Vietnam, which involved deploying large numbers of combat troops, aggressive bombing attacks, and uprooting entire village populations and forcing them into [[Strategic Hamlet Program|strategic hamlets]]. Montgomery said that the Americans' most important problem was that they had no clear-cut objective, and allowed local commanders to set military policy. At the end of their meeting, Montgomery asked Dayan to tell the Americans, in his name, that they were "insane".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/moshe-dayan-sounds-the-alarm-in-vietnam-3.htm|title=Moshe Dayan Sounds the Alarm in Vietnam|date=15 September 2011|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref>
