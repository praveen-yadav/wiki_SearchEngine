===Performance-enhancing===

Therapeutic doses of psychostimulants, including amphetamine, improve performance on [[working memory]] tests both in normal functioning individuals and those with {{abbr|ADHD|attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}}.<ref name="Malenka_2009" /> Moreover, these stimulants also increase arousal and, within the [[nucleus accumbens]], improve task [[Salience (neuroscience)|saliency]].<ref name="Malenka_2009" />  Thus, stimulants improve performance on effortful and tedious tasks as well.<ref name="Malenka_2009">{{cite book| author = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE | editor = Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | page = 318 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 13: Higher Cognitive Function and Behavioral Control | quote=Therapeutic (relatively low) doses of psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, improve performance on working memory tasks both in individuals with ADHD and in normal subjects. Positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrates that methylphenidate decreases regional cerebral blood flow in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex while improving performance of a spacial working memory task. This suggests that cortical networks that normally process spatial working memory become more efficient in response to the drug. Both methylphenidate and amphetamines act by triggering the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, actions mediated via the plasma membrane transporters of these neurotransmitters and via the shared vesicular monoamine transporter (Chapter 6). Based on animal studies with micro-iontophoretic application of selective D1 dopamine receptor agonists (such as the partial agonist SKF38393 or the full agonist SKF81297) and antagonist (such as SCH23390), and clinical evidence in humans with ADHD, it is now believed that dopamine and norepinephrine, but not serotonin, produce the beneficial effects of stimulants on working memory. At abused (relatively high) doses, stimulants can interfere with working memory and cognitive control, as will be discussed below. It is important to recognize, however, that stimulants act not only on working memory function, but also on general levels of arousal and, within the nucleus accumbens, improve the saliency of tasks.

==Interactions==

Amphetamine interacts with many substances due to its effects and its the metabolic systems that break it down into its metabolites.  Since amphetamine is metabolized by the liver enzyme [[CYP2D6]], CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as [[SSRI]]s and bupropion, will prolong the [[elimination half-life]] of amphetamine.<ref name="FDA Interactions">{{cite web | title = Adderall XR Prescribing Information | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021303s024lbl.pdf | work = United States Food and Drug Administration | month = June | year = 2013 | accessdate = 2 November 2013 | pages = 8&ndash;10 }}</ref>  Moreover, amphetamine also interacts with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs), since both MAOIs and amphetamine increase plasma catecholamines; therefore, concurrent use of both is dangerous.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />  Amphetamine will modulate the activity of most psychoactive drugs.  In particular, amphetamine may decrease the effects of [[sedative]]s and [[depressant]]s and increase the effects of [[stimulant]]s and [[antidepressant]]s.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />  Amphetamine may also decrease the effects of [[antihypertensives]] and [[antipsychotic]]s due to its effects on blood pressure and dopamine respectively.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />  While there is no significant effect on consuming amphetamine with food in general, the pH of gastrointestinal and urine content affects the absorption and excretion of amphetamine, respectively.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />  Specifically, acidic substances will reduce the absorption of amphetamine and increase urinary excretion, while alkaline substances do the opposite.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />  Due to the effect pH has on absorption, amphetamine also interacts with gastric acid reducers such as [[proton pump inhibitor]]s and [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub> antihistamines]], which decrease gastrointestinal pH.<ref name="FDA Interactions" />

====Synthesis====

Amphetamine can be synthesized by [[Knoevenagel condensation]] of [[benzaldehyde]] with [[nitroethane]], which is subsequently [[Redox|reduced]] by [[hydrogenation]] of the double bond and reduction of the [[nitro group]] using hydrogen over a [[palladium]] catalyst or [[lithium aluminum hydride]].<ref name="Delta Isotope">{{cite journal | author = Collins M, Salouros H, Cawley AT, Robertson J, Heagney AC, Arenas-Queralt A | title = δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>2</sup>H isotope ratios in amphetamine synthesized from benzaldehyde and nitroethane | journal = Rapid Commun.

In the first step, an [[Eschweiler&ndash;Clarke reaction]] between phenylacetone and [[formamide]] using [[formic acid]] as a reducing agent yields the synthetic intermediate {{nowrap|[[N-formylamphetamine|''N''-formylamphetamine]]}}.<ref name="Amph Synth" />  This intermediate is then hydrolysed using hydrochloric acid, and subsequently basified, extracted with organic solvent, concentrated, and distilled to yield the [[free base]]. The free base is then dissolved in an organic solvent, sulfuric acid added, and amphetamine precipitates out as the sulfate salt.<ref name="Amph Synth" />

===Pharmacodynamics===

Amphetamine has been identified as a potent [[full agonist]] of [[TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1]] (TAAR1), a [[G protein-coupled receptor]] (GPCR) discovered in 2001, which is important for regulation of brain [[monoaminergic|monoamines]].<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="PubChem Targets" /><ref name="pmid11459929" /><ref name="DrugBank 2">{{cite web | title=Amphetamine | url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00182#targets | work=DrugBank | publisher= University of Alberta | accessdate=13 October 2013 | date=8 February 2013 | section=Targets }}</ref> Activation of {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} increases [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) production via [[adenylyl cyclase]] activation and inhibits [[monoamine transporter]] function.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="pmid11459929">{{cite journal | author = Borowsky B, Adham N, Jones KA, Raddatz R, Artymyshyn R, Ogozalek KL, Durkin MM, Lakhlani PP, Bonini JA, Pathirana S, Boyle N, Pu X, Kouranova E, Lichtblau H, Ochoa FY, Branchek TA, Gerald C | title = Trace amines: identification of a family of mammalian G protein-coupled receptors | journal = Proc.

The activity of amphetamine on monoamine transporters in the brain also appears to be site specific.<ref name="Miller" /> Specifically, it has been observed that non-competitive inhibition of monoamine transporters by amphetamine and trace amines is dependent upon the presence of {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} co-localization in the associated monoamine neurons.<ref name="Miller" />  As of 2010, co-localization of {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} and the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) has been visualized in rhesus monkeys, but co-localization of {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} with the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET) and the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) has only been evidenced by [[mRNA]] expression.<ref name="Miller" /> The major neural systems affected by amphetamine are largely implicated in the reward and executive function pathways of the brain, collectively known as the [[mesocorticolimbic projection]].<ref name="cognition enhancers" /> In particular, the concentrations of the primary neurotransmitters involved in reward circuitry and executive functioning, dopamine and norepinephrine, are markedly increased in a dose-dependent manner by amphetamine due to its effects on monoamine transporters.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="cognition enhancers" /><ref name="E Weihe" /> The reinforcing and task saliency effects of amphetamine, however, are mostly due to enhanced dopaminergic activity in the [[mesolimbic pathway]].<ref name="Malenka_2009" />

As a {{abbr|CNS|central nervous system}} stimulant, dextroamphetamine is roughly three to four times more potent than levoamphetamine, but levoamphetamine has stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects.<ref name="Westfall" /><ref name="PubChem Header">{{cite web | title=Amphetamine | url=http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=3007 | work=PubChem Compound | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information | accessdate=13 October 2013 | section=Compound Summary }}</ref>

====Dopamine====

The most widely studied neurotransmitter with regard to amphetamine action in the central nervous system is dopamine.<ref name="Miller" /> Studies have shown that, in certain brain regions, amphetamine increases the concentrations of dopamine in the [[synaptic cleft]], thereby heightening the response of the post-synaptic neuron.<ref name="Miller" /> The various mechanisms by which amphetamine affects dopamine concentrations have been studied extensively, and are known to involve both {{abbr|DAT|dopamine transporter}} and {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="DrugBank 2" /><ref name="E Weihe">{{cite journal | author = Eiden LE, Weihe E | title = VMAT2: a dynamic regulator of brain monoaminergic neuronal function interacting with drugs of abuse | journal = Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. | volume = 1216 | issue = | pages = 86&ndash;98 | month = January | year = 2011 | pmid = 21272013 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05906.x }}</ref>  Amphetamine is similar in structure to dopamine and trace amines; consequently, it can enter the presynaptic neuron via {{abbr|DAT|dopamine transporter}} as well as by diffusing through the neural membrane directly.<ref name="Miller" /> Upon entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamine activates {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} which, through [[protein kinase]] signaling, induces dopamine efflux, [[phosphorylation|phosphorylation-dependent]] {{abbr|DAT|dopamine transporter}} [[endocytosis|internalization]], and non-competitive reuptake inhibition.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="TAAR1 Review">{{cite journal | author = Maguire JJ, Parker WA, Foord SM, Bonner TI, Neubig RR, Davenport AP | title = International Union of Pharmacology. LXXII. Recommendations for trace amine receptor nomenclature | journal = Pharmacol. Rev. | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&ndash;8 | month = March | year = 2009 | pmid = 19325074 | pmc = 2830119 | doi = 10.1124/pr.109.001107 }}</ref> Because of the similarity between amphetamine and trace amines, it is also a substrate for monoamine transporters; consequently, it (competitively) inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and other monoamines by competing with them for uptake as well.<ref name="Miller" />

In addition, amphetamine is a substrate for the neuronal vesicular monoamine transporter, {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}.<ref name="E Weihe" /> When amphetamine is taken up by {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}, the vesicle releases (effluxes) dopamine molecules into the cytosol in exchange.<ref name="E Weihe" />  At high doses, amphetamine inhibits monoamine oxidase, which results in less conversion of dopamine into [[dihydroxyphenylacetic acid]], and therefore higher concentrations of synaptic dopamine.<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" /><ref name="PubChem Header" />

====Norepinephrine====

It is well-established that amphetamine causes increased brain and blood levels of norepinephrine,<ref name="cognition enhancers" /> the direct precursor of [[adrenaline]]. Based upon the effects of co-localized {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} with {{abbr|NET|norepinephrine transporter}} in animals and presence of its mRNA in humans, this is thought to occur analogously to its effect on dopamine.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="TAAR1 Review" /> In other words, amphetamine causes norepinephrine efflux and reuptake inhibition through {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} effects on {{abbr|NET|norepinephrine transporter}}, competitive reuptake inhibition at {{abbr|NET|norepinephrine transporter}}, and norepinephrine efflux from {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="E Weihe" />

====Serotonin====

Amphetamine has been found to exert similar effects on serotonin as on dopamine.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="TAAR1 Review" /> Like {{abbr|DAT|dopamine transporter}}, {{abbr|SERT|serotonin transporter}} can be induced to operate in reverse upon amphetamine stimulation, via {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} that are co-localized with {{abbr|SERT|serotonin transporter}}.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="TAAR1 Review" /> The serotonin effluxion and reuptake inhibition effects of amphetamine are not present in {{abbr|SERT|serotonin transporter}} cells that lack {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}}.<ref name="Miller" />  The effect of amphetamine on serotonin through {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}} is also similar to dopamine and norepinephrine.<ref name="E Weihe" />

====Acetylcholine====

While amphetamine has no direct effect on acetylcholine, several studies have noted that it increases acetylcholine release after use.<ref name="Acetylcholine" /><ref name="MEDRS-Cholinergic" /> In a study on rats, amphetamine, administered at high therapeutic (1&nbsp;mg/kg) and supratherapeutic (2&nbsp;mg/kg) doses, greatly increased acetylcholine levels in many areas of the brain, including the [[hippocampus]], [[caudate nucleus]], [[prefrontal cortex]], [[nucleus accumbens]], and [[basal ganglia]].<ref name="Acetylcholine" />  In humans, this is thought to occur via a cholinergic&ndash;dopaminergic link, mediated by a neuropeptide, [[ghrelin]], in the [[ventral tegmentum]].<ref name="MEDRS-Cholinergic" /> This heightened [[cholinergic]] activity leads to heightened activation of [[nicotinic receptors]]. This likely contributes to the [[nootropic]] effects of amphetamine.<ref name="pmid21334367">{{cite journal | author = Levin ED, Bushnell PJ, Rezvani AH | title = Attention-modulating effects of cognitive enhancers | journal = Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 146&ndash;154 | month = August | year = 2011 | pmid = 21334367 | pmc = 3114188 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2011.02.008 }}</ref>

====Other relevant activity====

Extracellular levels of [[glutamate]], the primary [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory neurotransmitter]] in the brain, have been shown to increase upon exposure to amphetamine.<ref name="glutamate1" /><ref name="glutamate2" /> Consistent with other findings, this effect was found in the mesolimbic pathway, an area of the brain implicated in reward.<ref name="glutamate1" /><ref name="glutamate2" />  Amphetamine also induces effluxion of [[histamine]] via a {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}-mediated mechanism.<ref name="E Weihe" />

===Pharmacokinetics===

The [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of amphetamine enantiomers differ and vary with age.<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" />  The half life for dextroamphetamine is 9&nbsp;hours for children of ages&nbsp;6&ndash;12, 11&nbsp;hours in adolescents aged&nbsp;13&ndash;17, and 10&nbsp;hours in adults.<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" /> For levoamphetamine, the half-life is 11&nbsp;hours for children of ages&nbsp;6&ndash;12, 13&ndash;14&nbsp;hours in adolescents aged&nbsp;13&ndash;17, and  13&nbsp;hours in adults.<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" />  The immediate-release and extended release variants of salts of both isomers reach peak plasma concentrations at 3&nbsp;hours and 7&nbsp;hours post-dose respectively.<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" />  Amphetamine is eliminated renally with 30&ndash;40% of the drug being excreted unchanged at normal urinary pH.<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" />  Amphetamine is a weak base with a [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] of 9&ndash;10; consequently, when the urinary pH is basic, more of the drug is in its free base form and less is excreted.<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" />  When urine pH is abnormal, the urinary recovery of amphetamine may range from a low of 1% to as much as 75%, depending mostly upon whether urine is too alkaline or acidic respectively.<ref name="FDA Pharmacokinetics" />  Amphetamine is usually eliminated within two days of the last oral dose.<ref name="Pubchem Kinetics" />  Apparent half-life and duration of effect increase with repeated use and accumulation of drug.<ref name="Flomenbaum_2006">{{cite web | author = Richard RA | title = Chapter 5&mdash;Medical Aspects of Stimulant Use Disorders | series = Treatment Improvement Protocol 33 | year = 1999 | work = National Center for Biotechnology Information Bookshelf | publisher = Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64323/ | section = Route of Administration}}</ref>

===Related endogenous compounds===

Amphetamine has a very similar structure and function to the endogenous trace amines, which are naturally occurring molecules produced in the human body and brain.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="Trace Amines" />  Among this group, the most closely related compounds are phenethylamine, the parent compound of amphetamine, and {{nowrap|[[N-methylphenethylamine|''N''-methylphenethylamine]]}}, an [[isomer]] of amphetamine (i.e., identical molecular formula).<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="Trace Amines" /> In humans, phenethylamine is produced in the body directly from [[phenylalanine]] by the same enzyme that converts [[L-DOPA]] into dopamine, [[aromatic amino acid decarboxylase]].<ref name="Trace Amines" /> In turn, {{nowrap|''N''‑methylphenethylamine}} is metabolized from phenethylamine by [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase]], which the same enzyme that metabolizes norepinephrine into adrenaline.<ref name="Trace Amines">{{cite journal | author = Broadley KJ | title = The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines | journal = Pharmacol.

Synthetic and metabolic pathways for endogenous and exogenously administered trace amines and sympathomimetic amines...<br> Trace amines are metabolized in the mammalian body via monoamine oxidase (MAO; EC 1.4.3.4) (Berry, 2004) (Fig. 2)...It deaminates primary and secondary amines that are free in the neuronal cytoplasm but not those bound in storage vesicles of the sympathetic neurone...<br>Thus, MAO inhibitors potentiate the peripheral effects of indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines. It is not often realized, however, that this potentiation occurs irrespective of whether the amine is a substrate for MAO. An α-methyl group on the side chain, as in amphetamine and ephedrine, renders the amine immune to deamination so that they are not metabolized in the gut. Similarly, β-PEA would not be deaminated in the gut as it is a selective substrate for MAO-B which is not found in the gut...<br> Brain levels of endogenous trace amines are several hundred-fold below those for the classical neurotransmitters noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin but their rates of synthesis are equivalent to those of noradrenaline and dopamine and they have a very rapid turnover rate (Berry, 2004). Endogenous extracellular tissue levels of trace amines measured in the brain are in the low nanomolar range.
