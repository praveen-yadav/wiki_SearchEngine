In [[abstract algebra]], an '''alternative algebra''' is an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] in which multiplication need not be [[associative]], only [[alternativity|alternative]]. That is, one must have
*<math>x(xy) = (xx)y</math>
*<math>(yx)x = y(xx)</math>
for all ''x'' and ''y'' in the algebra. Every [[associative algebra]] is obviously alternative, but so too are some strictly [[Algebra over a field#Non-associative algebras|nonassociative algebras]] such as the [[octonion]]s. The [[sedenion]]s, on the other hand, are not alternative.

==The associator==

Alternative algebras are so named because they are precisely the algebras for which the [[associator]] is [[alternating form|alternating]]. The associator is a [[multilinear map|trilinear map]] given by
:<math>[x,y,z] = (xy)z - x(yz)</math>
By definition a multilinear map is alternating if it vanishes whenever two of its arguments are equal. The left and right alternative identities for an algebra are equivalent to<ref name=Sch27>Schafer (1995) p.27</ref>
:<math>[x,x,y] = 0</math>
:<math>[y,x,x] = 0.</math>
Both of these identities together imply that the associator is totally [[skew-symmetric]]. That is,
:<math>[x_{\sigma(1)}, x_{\sigma(2)}, x_{\sigma(3)}] = \sgn(\sigma)[x_1,x_2,x_3]</math>
for any [[permutation]] σ. It follows that
:<math>[x,y,x] = 0</math>
for all ''x'' and ''y''. This is equivalent to the ''[[flexible identity]]''<ref name=Sch28>Schafer (1995) p.28</ref>
:<math>(xy)x = x(yx).</math>
The associator of an alternative algebra is therefore alternating. Conversely, any algebra whose associator is alternating is clearly alternative. By symmetry, any algebra which satisfies any two of:
*left alternative identity: <math>x(xy) = (xx)y</math>
*right alternative identity: <math>(yx)x = y(xx)</math>
*flexible identity: <math>(xy)x = x(yx).</math>
is alternative and therefore satisfies all three identities.

An alternating associator is always totally skew-symmetric. The converse holds so long as the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the base field is not 2.

==Properties==
'''Artin's theorem''' states that in an alternative algebra the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two elements is [[associative]].<ref name=Sch29>Schafer (1995) p.29</ref>  Conversely, any algebra for which this is true is clearly alternative. It follows that expressions involving only two variables can be written without parenthesis unambiguously in an alternative algebra. A generalization of Artin's theorem states that whenever three elements <math>x,y,z</math> in an alternative algebra associate (i.e. <math>[x,y,z] = 0</math>) the subalgebra generated by those elements is associative.

A corollary of Artin's theorem is that alternative algebras are [[power-associative]], that is, the subalgebra generated by a single element is associative.<ref name=Sch30>Schafer (1995) p.30</ref>  The converse need not hold: the [[sedenion]]s are power-associative but not alternative.

The [[Moufang identities]]
*<math>a(x(ay)) = (axa)y</math>
*<math>((xa)y)a = x(aya)</math>
*<math>(ax)(ya) = a(xy)a</math>
hold in any alternative algebra.<ref name=Sch28/>

In a unital alternative algebra, multiplicative inverses are unique whenever they exist. Moreover, for any invertible element <math>x</math> and all <math>y</math> one has
:<math>y = x^{-1}(xy).</math>
This is equivalent to saying the associator <math>[x^{-1},x,y]</math> vanishes for all such <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. If <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are invertible then <math>xy</math> is also invertible with inverse <math>(xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}</math>. The set of all invertible elements is therefore closed under multiplication and forms a [[Moufang loop]]. This ''loop of units'' in an alternative ring or algebra is analogous to the [[group of units]] in an associative ring or algebra.

==Applications==
The projective plane over any alternative division ring is a [[Moufang plane]].

The close relationship of alternative algebras and [[composition algebra]]s was given by Guy Roos in 2008: He shows (page 162) the relation for an algebra ''A'' with unit element ''e'' and an [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[anti-automorphism]] <math>a \mapsto a^*</math> such that ''a'' + ''a''* and ''aa''* are on the line [[linear span|spanned]] by ''e'' for all ''a'' in ''A''. Use the notation ''n''(''a'') = ''aa''*. Then if ''n'' is a non-singular mapping into the field of ''A'', and ''A'' is alternative, then (''A,n'') is a composition algebra.
