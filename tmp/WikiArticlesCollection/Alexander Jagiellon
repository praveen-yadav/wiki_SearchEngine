==Biography==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Alexander Jagiellonczyk.svg|240px|left|Coat of Arms of Alexander I Jagiellon]]

'''Alexander''' was born as son of the King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] of [[Poland]] and [[Elisabeth of Austria (d. 1505)|Elisabeth Habsburg of Hungary]], daughter of the King [[Albert of Hungary]]. Alexander's shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the Polish Senate and nobility ([[szlachta]]), who deprived him of control of the mint (then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the Polish kings), curtailed his prerogatives, and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position. For want of funds, Alexander was unable to resist the Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Knights]] or prevent Grand Duke of Muscovy [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] from ravaging [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] with the [[Tatars]]. The most the Grand Duke of Lithuania could do was to garrison [[Smolensk]] and other strongholds and employ his wife Helena, the Tsar's daughter, to mediate a truce between his father-in-law and himself after the disastrous [[Battle of Vedrosha]] (1500). In the terms of the truce, Lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist Russian state.

During his reign, Poland suffered much humiliation at the hands of her subject principality, [[Moldavia]]. Only the death of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen]], the great ''[[hospodar]]'' of Moldavia, enabled Poland still to hold her own on the [[Danube River]]; while the liberality of [[Pope Julius II]], who issued no fewer than 29 bulls in favor of Poland and granted Alexander [[Peter's Pence]] and other financial help, enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the Teutonic Order.

Alexander Jagellon never felt at home in Poland, and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow Lithuanians, the most notable of whom was the wealthy Lithuanian magnate [[Michael Glinski]], who justified his master's confidence by his great victory over the Tatars at [[Kleck]] (5 August 1506), news of which was brought to Alexander on his deathbed in [[Vilnius]]. There is some evidence that he had at least one son, leading to a surviving Jagiellonian branch, although this is not conclusive.<ref>http://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2011/12/28/krolewska-poradnia-malzenska-aleksander-jagiellonczyk-i-helena-moskiewska/</ref>

It is important to note that Alexander was the last known ruler of the [[Gediminids]] dynasty to have maintained the family's ancestral [[Lithuanian language]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} From his death, Polish became the sole language of the family, thus fully [[Polonisation|Polonising]] the [[Jagiello]] family.

In 1931, during the refurbishment of [[Vilnius Cathedral]], the forgotten sarcophagus of Alexander was discovered, and has since been put on display.
