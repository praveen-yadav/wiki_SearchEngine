Population: {{ru-census|p2010=165,214|p2002=165,197|p1989=154,092}}

==History==
Abakansky ''[[ostrog]]'' ({{lang|ru|Абаканский острог}}) was built at this location in 1675,<ref name="gr">{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|page=13}}</ref> also known as '''Abakansk'''. In the [[Russian Empire]], it was a part of [[Yeniseysk Governorate]]. During 1823–1931, it was known as '''Ust-Abakanskoye''', in 1914–1925 as Abakan, in 1925–1931 as '''Khakassk'''. It was granted town status and given its current name in 1931.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Chinese exiles===
In 1940, Russian construction workers found ancient ruins during the construction of a highway between Abakan and the nearby district center village of Askyz (Аскыз). When the site was excavated by Soviet archaeologists during 1941-45, they realized that they had discovered a building absolutely unique for the area: a large (1500 square meters) Chinese-style, likely [[Han Dynasty]] era (206 BCE–220 CE) palace. The identity of the high-ranking personage who lived luxuriously in Chinese style, far outside of the borders of the Han Empire, has remained a matter for discussion ever since. Russian archaeologist L.A. Evtyukhova surmised, based on circumstantial evidence, that the palace may have been the residence of [[Li Ling (Han Dynasty)|Li Ling]], a Chinese general who had been defeated by the [[Xiongnu]] in 99 BC, and defected to them as a result.<ref>L.A. Evtyukhova (Л.А. Евтюхова), Southern Siberia in Ancient Times Южная Сибирь в древности). In: "Tracing Ancient Cultures between the Volga and the Pacific" (По следам древних культур: от Волги до Тихого Океана). Moscow, 1954, pp. 195-224.</ref> While this opinion has remained popular, other views have been expressed as well.  More recently, for example, it was claimed by A.A. Kovalyov as the residence of Lu Fang ([[:zh:卢芳|盧芳]]), a [[Han Dynasty|Han]] throne pretender from the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu]] era.<ref>A.A. Kovalyov (А.А. Ковалёв), [http://kronk.narod.ru/library/kovalov-aa-2007.htm ''Chinese Emperor on the Yenisy? Once more about the owner of the Tashebik "Palace"'' (''Китайский император на Енисее? Ещё раз о хозяине ташебинского «дворца»'')], in "Ethnohistory and archaeoilogy of Northern Eurasia: theory, methodology, and the recearch practice" ("Этноистория и археология Северной Евразии: теория, методология и практика исследования"). Irkutsk, 2007, pp.  145-148.</ref>

===Lithuanian exiles===
In the late eighteenth and during the nineteenth century, Lithuanian participants in the 1794, 1830–1831, and 1863 rebellions against the Russian [[czar]]ist rule were exiled to Abakan. A group of [[Labor camp|camp]]s was established, and prisoners were forced to work in the coal mines. After [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death, Lithuanian exiles from the nearby settlements moved in<ref>Abakanas. Aldona Juodvalkytė. {{VLE|I}}</ref>
