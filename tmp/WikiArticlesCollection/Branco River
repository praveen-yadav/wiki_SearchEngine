The '''Branco River''' ({{lang-pt|Rio Branco}}; Engl: ''White River'') is the principal [[Tributary|affluent]] of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] from the north. It is enriched by many streams from the [[Tepui]] highlands which separate [[Venezuela]] and [[Guyana]] from [[Brazil]]. Its two upper main tributaries are the [[Uraricoera River|Uraricoera]] and the [[Takutu River|Takutu]].<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Map of the Branco or Parimé River and of the Caratirimani Uararicapará Majari, Tacutú and Mahú Rivers|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/816|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref> The latter almost links its sources with those of the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]].

The Branco flows nearly [[south]], and finds its way into the Negro through several channels and a chain of [[lagoon]]s similar to those of the latter river.  It is {{convert|350|mi|km}} long, up to its Uraricoera [[confluence]].  It has numerous [[island]]s, and, {{convert|235|mi|km}} above its mouth, it is broken by a bad series of rapids.
