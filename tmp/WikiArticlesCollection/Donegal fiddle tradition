The '''Donegal fiddle tradition''' is the way of playing the [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddle]] that is traditional in [[County Donegal]], Ireland. It is one of the distinct fiddle traditions within [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]].<ref name="intro">{{Cite book|last = Vallely|first = Fintan|year = 1999|title= The Companion to Irish Traditional Music|publisher=Cork University Press|isbn=0-8147-8802-5|page=2|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

The distinctness of the Donegal tradition developed due to the close relations between Donegal and [[Scotland]], and the Donegal repertoire and style has influences from [[Traditional_music_of_Scotland#Folk_music|Scottish fiddle music]]. For example in addition to the standard tune types such as Jigs and Reels, the Donegal tradition also has Highlands (influenced by the Scottish [[Strathspey (dance)|Strathspey]]). The distinctiveness of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict between Donegal players and representatives of the mainstream tradition when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.

The tradition has several distinguishing traits compared to other fiddle traditions such as the [[Sliabh Luachra]] style of southern ireland, most of which involves styles of [[Bow (music)|bowing]] and the [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]] of the music, and rhythm. Due to the frequency of double stops and the strong bowing it is often compared to the [[Cape Breton fiddling|Cape Breton]].<ref>June Skinner Sawyers. 2001. Celtic music: a complete guide. Da Capo Press. p. 69</ref> Tradition Another characteristic of the style is the rapid pace at which it tends to proceed.<ref name="intro"/> Modern players, such as the fiddle group [[Altan (band)|Altan]], continue to be popular due to a variety of reasons.<ref name="international">{{cite book|title=The Companion to Irish Traditional Music|author=Fintan Vallely|publisher=New York University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-8147-8802-5}}</ref>

Among the most famous Donegal style players are [[John Doherty (musician)|John Doherty]] from the early twentieth century and [[James Byrne (musician)|James Byrne]], [[Paddy Glackin]], [[Tommy Peoples]] and [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]] in recent decades.

==History==
[[File:Altanlivegweedore.jpg|300px|thumb|Donegal fiddle group Altan performing at the [[Frankie Kennedy Winter Music School]] in [[Gaoth Dobhair]], [[Co. Donegal]] in 2007.]]
The fiddle has ancient roots in Ireland, the first report of bowed instruments similar to the violin being in the [[Book of Leinster]] (ca. 1160). The modern violin was ubiquitous in Ireland by the early 1700s. However the first mention of the fiddle being in use in Donegal is from the blind harper [[Artur O'Neill (harpist)|Arthur O'Neill]] who in his 1760 memoirs described a wedding in [[Ardara]] as having "plenty of pipers and fiddlers".<ref name="ReferenceACh2">Between the Jigs and the Reels: The Donegal Fiddle Tradition C Mac Aoidh – 1994 – Drumlin Publications</ref><ref name="Music D McLaughlin pp. 22">Donegal and Shetland Fiddle Music D McLaughlin, Irish Traditional Music Society – 1992 – Irish Traditional Music Society, University College, Cork. Chapter 2 "A history of Donegal Fiddle Music" pp. 22–35</ref> Donegal fiddlers participated in the development of the Irish music tradition in the 18th century during which jigs and slipjigs and later reels and hornpipes became the dominant musical forms. However, Donegal musicians, many of them being fishermen, also frequently travelled to Scotland, where they acquired tune types from the [[Traditional music of Scotland|Scottish repertoire]] such as the [[Strathspey (dance)|Strathspey]] which was integrated into the Donegal tradition as "Highland" tunes. The Donegal tradition derives much of its unique character from the synthesis of Irish and Scottish stylistic features and repertoires.<ref name="ReferenceACh2"/><ref name="Music D McLaughlin pp. 22"/> Aoidh notes however that while different types of art music were commonly played among the upper classes of Scottish society in the 18th century, the Donegal tradition drew exclusively from the popular types of Scottish music.<ref name="ReferenceACh2"/><ref>Donegal and Shetland Fiddle Music D McLaughlin, Irish Traditional Music Society – 1992 – Irish Traditional Music Society, University College, Cork</ref><ref name = "jrqigj">Changing cultural landscapes: the co-existence of musical genres in Irish culture and education. M McCarthy – Irish Studies Review, 2004 – Taylor & Francis</ref> Like some Scottish fiddlers (who, like Donegal fiddlers, tend to use a short bow and play in a straight-ahead fashion), some Donegal fiddlers worked at imitating the sound of the [[bagpipes]]. Workers from Donegal would bring their music to Scotland and also bring back Scottish tunes with them such music of J. Scott Skinner and Mackenzie Murdoch.<ref name="mustrad">{{Cite document|unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: publisher=Taylor & Francis|title=Changing cultural landscapes: the co-existence of musical genres in Irish culture and education|first=M.|last=McCarthy|publisher=Irish Studies Review|year=2004|page=134|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> [[Lilting]], unaccompanied singing of wordless tunes, was also an important part of the Donegal musical tradition often performed by women in social settings. Describing the musical life of Arranmore Island in the late 19th century singer Róise Rua Nic Gríanna describes the most popular dances: "The Sets, the Lancers, the maggie Piggy, the Donkey, the [[Mazurka]] and the [[Barn dance]]s". Among the travelling fiddlers of the late 19th century players such as John Mhosaí McGinley, Anthony Hlferty, the McConnells and the Dohertys are best known. As skill levels increased through apprenticeships several fiddle masters appeared such as the Cassidy's, Connie Haughey, Jimmy Lyons and Miock McShane of Teelin and Francie Dearg and Mickey Bán Byrne of Kilcar. These virtuosos played unaccompanied listening pieces in addition to the more common dance music.<ref name="ReferenceACh2"/>

The influences between Scotland and Donegal went both ways and were furthered by a wave of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indigo.ie/~donances/FrameSet3.html|title=Some Donegal Surnames|accessdate=8 March 2008|publisher=Donegal Ancestry}}</ref> (the regions share common names of dances), as can be heard in the volume of strathspeys, [[schottische]]s, [[march (music)|marches]], and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the [[Piob Mhor|Píob Mhór]], the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland.<ref name="ss">{{cite web|url=http://www.standingstones.com/donegalf.html|title=The Fiddle Music of Donegal|accessdate=8 March 2008|author=Michael Robinson|publisher=The Standing Stones}}</ref> There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times.<ref name="ReferenceACh2"/> Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin.<ref name = "jrqigj"/> The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire.<ref name = "jrqigj"/> These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishfiddle.com/mcguireinterview.html|title=Sean McGuire: Master of The Irish Violin|accessdate=8 March 2008|author=Ken Perlman|publisher=The Irish Fiddle}}</ref>

As Irish music was consolidated and organised under the [[Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann]] movement in the 1960s, both strengthened the interest in traditional music but sometimes conflicted with the Donegal tradition and its social conventions. The rigidly organised sessions of the Comhaltas reflected the traditions of Southern Ireland and Donegal fiddlers like John Doherty considered the National repertoire with its strong focus on reels to be less diverse than that of Donegal with its varied rhythms. Other old fiddlers dislike the ways comhaltas sessions were organised with a committee player, often not himself a musician, in charge. Sometimes Comhaltas representatives would even disparage the Donegal tradition, with its Scottish flavour, as being un-Irish, and prohibit them from playing local tunes with Scottish genealogies such as the "Highlands" at Comhaltas sessions. This sometimes cause antagonism between Donegal players and the main organisation of Traditinoal music in ireland.<ref name="ReferenceACh2"/><ref name="Music D McLaughlin pp. 22"/>

Outside of the Comhaltas movement however, Donegal fiddling stood strong with [[Paddy Glackin]] of Ceoltorí Laighean and the [[Bothy Band]] and later [[Tommy Peoples]] also with the Bothy Band and Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh with [[Altan (band)|Altan]], who all drew attention and prestige to the Donegal tradition within folk music circles throughout Ireland.

==Description of style==
[[File:Donegalfiddle.PNG|thumb|right|450px|An example of the described musical styles.]]
The Donegal style of fiddling is a label often applied to music from this area, though one also might plausibly identify several different, but related, styles within the county.<ref name="ss">{{cite web|url=http://www.standingstones.com/donegalf.html|title=The Fiddle Music of Donegal|author=Michael Robinson|publisher=The Standing Stones|accessdate=8 March 2008}}</ref> To the extent to which there is one common style in the county, it is characterised by a rapid pace; a tendency to be more un-[[Swung note|swung]] in the playing of the fast dance tune types ([[reel (dance)|reel]] and [[jig]]s); short (non-[[Slur (music)|slurred]]), aggressive bowing, sparse ornamentation, the use of bowed [[Tuplet|triplets]] more often than [[Trill consonant|trills]] as [[musical ornament|ornaments]], the use of [[double stop]]s and droning; and the occurrence of "playing the octave", with one player playing the melody and the other playing the melody an octave lower. None of these characteristics are universal, and there is some disagreement as to the extent to which there is a common style at all. In general, however, the style is rather aggressive.<ref name="intro"/>

Another feature of Donegal fiddling that makes it distinctive among Irish musical traditions is the variety of rare tune types that are played. [[Highland (Irish)|Highlands]], a type of tune in [[4/4 time]] with some similarities to Scottish [[strathspey (dance)|strathspeys]], which are also played in Donegal, are one of the most commonly played types of tune in the county. Other tune types common solely in the county include barndances, also called "Germans," and [[mazurka]]s.<ref name="ma" />

===Historical===
[[File:Donegalmap.jpg|alt=Map of County Donegal showing mountainous regions and lowlands adjacent to the water.|right|thumb|Map showing the geography and some of the different regions of Donegal.]]There are a number of different strands to the history of fiddle playing in County Donegal.<ref name="ma">{{Cite document|title=Between the Jigs and the Reels: The Donegal Fiddle Tradition|first=C. |last=MacAoidh|year=1994|publisher=Drumlin Publications|page=125|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Perhaps the best-known and, in the last half of the twentieth century, the most influential has been that of the Doherty family.<ref name="mustrad"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlesessions.com/oct06/mccarrick.html|title=Famous Fiddlers, General Knowledge and Where to Get It Part Three|accessdate=8 March 2008|author=Tim McCarrick|publisher=Mel Bay Publications, Inc.}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> [[Hugh Doherty (musician)|Hugh Doherty]] is the first known musician of this family.

There is no single Donegal style but several distinctive styles. These styles traditionally come from the geographical isolated regions of Donegal including [[Inishowen]], eastern Donegal, [[The Rosses]] and [[Gweedore]], [[Croaghs]], [[Teelin]], [[Kilcar]], [[Glencolmcille]], [[Ballyshannon]] and [[Bundoran]]. Even with improved communications and transport, these regions still have recognisably different ways of fiddle playing. Notable deceased players of the older Donegal styles include Neillidh ("Neilly") Boyle, Francie Byrne, Con Cassidy,Frank Cassidy, [[James Byrne (musician)|James Byrne]] (1946–2008), and P.V. O'Donnell (2011). Currently living Donegal fiddlers, include, [[Vincent Campbell]], [[John Gallagher (fiddler)|John Gallagher]], [[Paddy Glackin]], [[Danny O'Donnell (fiddler)|Danny O'Donnell]], and [[Tommy Peoples]].<ref name="ma" />
