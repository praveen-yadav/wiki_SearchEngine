==Physical geography==

=== Between the Alps and the Baltics ===
Geography strongly defines Central Europe's borders with its neighbouring regions to the North and South, namely [[Northern Europe]] (or [[Scandinavia]]) across the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[Apennine peninsula]] (or [[Italy]]) across the [[Alps]] and the [[Balkan peninsula]] across the Soča-Krka-Sava-Danube line. The borders to [[Western Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]] are geographically less defined and for this reason the [[cultural]] and historical boundaries migrate more easily West-East than South-North. The [[Rhine]] river which runs South-North through Western Germany is an exception.{{or|date=November 2013}}
[[File:Mapcarpat2.png|thumb|right|[[Carpathian mountains|Carpathian]] countries (north to south): [[Austria|AT]], [[Czech Republic|CZ]], [[Poland|PL]], [[Slovakia|SK]], [[Hungary|HU]], [[Ukraine|UA]], [[Romania|RO]], [[Serbia|SRB]]]]

===Pannonian Plain and Carpathian Mountains===
[[File:Carpathian Basin-Pannonian Basin.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pannonian Plain]], between the [[Alps]] (west), the [[Carpathians]] (north and east), and the [[Sava]]/[[Danube]] (south)]]

Southwards, the [[Pannonian Plain]] is bounded by the rivers [[Sava]] and [[Danube]]- and their respective floodplains.<ref>[http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr-files/14017 Danube Facts and Figures. Bosnia and Herzegovina (April 2007)] (PDF file)</ref> The [[Pannonian Plain]] stretches over the following countries: [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], and touches borders of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Republika Srpska]]) and [[Ukraine]] ("peri- Pannonian states").

===Dinaric Alps===
As southeastern division of the [[Eastern Alps]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/163795/Dinaric-Alps |title=Dinaric Alps (mountains, Europe)|accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> the [[Dinaric Alps]] extend for 650 kilometres along the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] (northwest-southeast), from the [[Julian Alps]] in the northwest down to the Šar-Korab massif, north-south. According to the Freie Universitaet Berlin<ref>{{cite web|author=Juliane Dittrich |url=http://www.grin.com/e-book/37159/die-alpen-hoehenstufen-und-vegetation |title=Die Alpen – Höhenstufen und Vegetation – Hauptseminararbeit |publisher=GRIN |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> this [[Dinaric Alps|mountain chain]] is classified as [[Alps|South Central European]].

== Current views on Central Europe ==

Rather than a physical entity, Central Europe is a concept of shared history which contrasts with that of the surrounding regions. The issue of how to name and define the Central European region is subject to debates. Very often, the definition depends on the nationality and historical perspective of its author.

Main propositions, gathered by [[Jerzy Kłoczowski]], include:<ref>[[Jerzy Kłoczowski]], Actualité des grandes traditions de la cohabitation et du dialogue des cultures en Europe du Centre-Est, in: L'héritage historique de la Res Publica de Plusieurs Nations, Lublin 2004, pp. 29–30 ISBN 83-85854-82-7</ref>
* West-Central and [[East-Central Europe]] – this conception, presented in 1950,<ref>[[Oskar Halecki]], The Limits and Divisions of European History, Sheed & Ward: London and New York 1950, chapter VII</ref> distinguishes two regions in Central Europe: German West-Centre, with imperial tradition of the ''[[Reich]]'', and the East-Centre covered by variety of nations ''from [[Finland]] to [[Greece]]'', placed between great empires of [[Scandinavia]], Germany, [[Italy]] and the [[Soviet Union]].
* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] – [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Belarus]]ian and [[Lithuania]]n historians, in cooperation (since 1990) with [[Poland|Polish]] historians, insist on the importance of the concept.
* Central Europe as a region connected to the [[western world|Western civilisation]] for a very long time, including countries like the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], later [[German Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Crown of Bohemia]]. Central Europe understood in this way borders on [[Russia]] and [[South-Eastern Europe]], but the exact frontier of the region is difficult to determine.
* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the Habsburg Empire (later [[Austria-Hungary]]) – a concept which is popular in regions along the [[Danube River]].
* A concept underlining the links connecting [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] with [[Russia]] and treating the [[Russian Empire]] together with the whole [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population as one entity – this position is taken by the [[Russia]]n historiography.
* A concept putting an accent on the links with the West, especially from the 19th century and the grand period of liberation and formation of Nation-states – this idea is represented by in the [[South-Eastern Europe|South-Eastern]] states, which prefer the enlarged concept of the “East Centre” expressing their links with the [[Western culture]].

According to [[Ronald Tiersky]], the 1991 summit held in [[Visegrád]], [[Hungary]] and attended by the [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] presidents was hailed at the time as a major breakthrough in Central European cooperation, but the [[Visegrád Group]] became a vehicle for coordinating Central Europe's road to the European Union, while development of closer ties within the region languished.<ref name="Tiersky, p. 472">[[Ronald Tiersky|Tiersky]], p. 472</ref>

[[Peter J. Katzenstein]] described Central Europe as a way station in a Europeanization process that marks the transformation process of the [[Visegrád Group]] countries in different, though comparable ways.<ref name="Peter J p. 6">[[Peter J. Katzenstein|Katzenstein]], p. 6</ref> According to him, in Germany's contemporary public discourse "Central European identity" refers to the civilizational divide between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.<ref name="Peter J p. 6"/> He says there's no precise, uncontestable way to decide whether the Baltic states, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, and Bulgaria are parts of Central Europe or not.<ref name="Peter J p. 4">[[Peter J.

He also thinks that Central Europe is a dynamical historical concept, not a static spatial one.

The German Encyclopaedia ''Meyers Grosses Taschenlexikon'' ({{lang-en|Meyers Big Pocket Encyclopedia}}), 1999, defines Central Europe as the central part of Europe with no precise borders to the East and West. The term is mostly used to denominate the territory between the [[Schelde]] to [[Vistula River|Vistula]] and from the [[Danube]] to the [[Moravian Gate]]. Usually the countries considered to be Central European are Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary; in the broader sense Romania too, northern Serbia, occasionally also the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

== Demographics ==

Central Europe is one of continent’s most populous regions. It includes countries of varied sizes, ranging from tiny Liechtenstein to Germany, the largest European country by population (that is entirely placed in Europe). Demographic figures for countries entirely located within notion of Central Europe (“the core countries”) number around 165 million people, out of which around 82 million are residents of Germany.<ref name=Eurostat>{{cite web |title=Demography report 2010|work=[[Eurostat]]|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KE-ET-10-001/EN/KE-ET-10-001-EN.PDF|accessdate=2012-05-12}}</ref> Other populations include: Poland with around 39 million residents, Czech republic at 10.5 million, Hungary - 10 million, Austria with 8.5 million, Switzerland with its 8 million inhabitants, Slovakia at 5.5 million, Croatia at 4,3 million, Slovenia at 2 million and [[Liechtenstein]] at 0,03 million.

If the countries which are occasionally included in Central Europe were counted in, partially or in whole - Romania (7 - 19 million people), Serbia (3,6 – 7 million), [[Lithuania]] (3.5 million), [[Latvia]] (2.5 million), [[Estonia]] (1.5 million) – it would contribute to the rise of between 20 - 37.5 million, depending on whether regional or integral approach was used.<ref name=Eurostat>{{cite web|title=Total population, Candidate countries and potential candidates
|work=[[Eurostat]]|http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=en&pcode=tgs00027&plugin=1}}</ref>
If smaller, western and eastern historical parts of Central Europe would be included in the demographic corpus, further 20 million people of different nationalities would also be added in the overall count, it would surpass the 200 million people figure.

== History of the concept ==

=== Middle Ages ===

As elements of unity for Western and Central Europe were considered the Roman Catholicism and Latin. Eastern Europe that remained Orthodox Christian, was the area of Byzantine cultural influence, and after the schism will develop cultural unity and protection against the Catholic and Protestant (Western) world, within the framework of Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet.<ref>[http://rediscover.manuscriptorium.com/files/rediscover/RO_Text_Catalogue_ENG_0.doc The shape of Europe. The spirit of unity through culture in the eve of Modern Europe].</ref>

According to Hungarian historian [[Jenő Szűcs]], foundations of Central European history at the first millennium were in close connection with Western European development. He explained that between the 11th and 15th centuries not only Christianization and its cultural consequences were implemented, but well-defined social features emerged in Central Europe based on Western characteristics. The keyword of Western social development after millennium was the spread of liberties and autonomies in Western Europe. These phenomena appeared in the middle of the 13th century in Central European countries. There were self-governments of towns, counties and parliaments.<ref>[http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/1162/1/Zsinka_2013b.pdf László Zsinka: ''Similarities and Differences in Polish and Hungarian History'']</ref>

In 1335 under the rule of the King [[Charles I of Hungary]], the castle of [[Visegrád]], the seat of the [[King of Hungary|Hungarian monarchs]] was the scene of the royal summit of the [[King of Poland|Kings of Poland]], [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and Hungary.<ref name=Halman/> They agreed to cooperate closely in the field of politics and commerce, inspiring their late successors to launch a successful [[Visegrád Group|Central European initiative]].<ref name=Halman>{{cite book|last=Halman|first=Loek|coauthors=Wilhelmus Antonius Arts|title=European values at the turn of the millennium|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2004|page=120|isbn=978-90-04-13981-7}}</ref>

In the Middle Ages, countries in Central Europe adopted [[Magdeburg rights]].

=== Before World War I ===
Before 1870, the industrialization that had developed in Western and Central Europe and the United States did not extend in any significant way to the rest of the world. Even in [[Eastern Europe]], industrialization lagged far behind. [[Russia]], for example, remained largely rural and agricultural, and its autocratic rulers kept the peasants in serfdom.<ref>Jackson J. Spielvogel: ''Western Civilization: Alternate Volume: Since 1300''. p. 618.</ref>

[[File:Central Europe 1902.PNG|thumb|right|A view of Central Europe dating from the time before the [[First World War]] (1902):<ref>Source: Geographisches Handbuch zu [[Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas|Andrees Handatlas]], vierte Auflage, Bielefeld und Leipzig, Velhagen und Klasing, 1902.</ref> {{legend|#FF0000|Central European countries and regions: Germany and Austria-Hungary (without Bosnia-Herzegovina and Dalmatia)}}{{legend|#FB607F|Regions located at the transition between Central Europe and Eastern Europe: Romania}}]]

The concept of Central Europe was already known at the beginning of the 19th century,<ref name="essex.ac.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/events/graduateconference/barcelona/papers/681.pdf |title="Mitteleuropa" is a multi-facetted concept and difficult to handle |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> but its real life began in the 20th century and immediately became an object of intensive interest. However, the very first concept mixed science, politics and economy – it was strictly connected with intensively growing German economy and its aspirations to dominate a part of European continent called ''Mitteleuropa''. The German term denoting Central Europe was so fashionable that other languages started referring to it when indicating territories from [[Rhine]] to [[Vistula]], or even [[Dnieper]], and from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Balkans]].<ref>A. Podraza, ''Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny'', 17th Congress of Polish Historians, [[Jagiellonian University]] 2004</ref> An example of that-time vision of Central Europe may be seen in J. Partsch’s book of 1903.<ref>Joseph Franz Maria Partsch, Clementina Black, Halford John Mackinder, ''Central Europe'', New York 1903</ref>

On 21 January 1904 – ''Mitteleuropäischer Wirtschaftsverein'' (Central European Economic Association) was established in [[Berlin]] with economic integration of Germany and Austria–Hungary (with eventual extension to [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]) as its main aim. Another time, the term Central Europe became connected to the German plans of political, economic and cultural domination. The “bible” of the concept was [[Friedrich Naumann]]’s book ''Mitteleuropa''<ref>F. Naumann, ''Mitteleuropa'', Berlin: Reimer, 1915</ref> in which he called for an economic federation to be established after the war. Naumann's idea was that the federation would have at its center Germany and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] but would also include all European nations outside the Anglo-French alliance, on one side, and Russia, on the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11015/Regions-Regionalism-Eastern-Europe-Central-versus-Eastern-Europe.html |title=Regions and Eastern Europe Regionalism – Central Versus Eastern Europe |publisher=Science.jrank.org |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> The concept failed after the German defeat in [[World War I]] and the [[Austria–Hungary#Dissolution|dissolution of Austria–Hungary]]. The revival of the idea may be observed during the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler era]].

=== Interwar period ===
[[File:Central Europe (Geographie universelle, 1927).PNG|thumb|right|[[Interwar period|Interwar]] Central Europe, according to the French geographer Emmanuel de Martonne (1927)]]
[[File:InterwarCentralEurope.png|thumb|right|Interwar Central Europe according to [[National Gallery of Art]]]]

According to [[Emmanuel de Martonne]], in 1927 the Central European countries included: Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania. Italy and Yugoslavia are not considered by the author to be Central European because they are located mostly outside Central Europe. The author use both Human and Physical Geographical features to define Central Europe.<ref>[http://img73.imageshack.us/img73/5269/file0039ao0.jpg ], [http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4384/martonne1.jpg ] and [http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/1867/martonne2a.jpg]; ''Géographie universelle'' (1927), edited by [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] and [[Lucien Gallois]])</ref>

The [[interwar period]] (1918–1939) brought new geopolitical system and economic and political problems, and the concept of Central Europe took a different character. The centre of interest was moved to its eastern part – the countries that have (re)appeared on the map of Europe: [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. Central Europe ceased to be the area of German aspiration to lead or dominate and became a territory of various integration movements aiming at resolving political, economic and national problems of "new" states, being a way to face German and Soviet pressures. However, the conflict of interests was too big and neither [[Little Entente]] nor [[Intermarium]] (''Międzymorze'') ideas succeeded.

The interwar period brought new elements to the concept of Central Europe. Before World War I, it embraced mainly German states (Germany, [[Austria]]), non-German territories being an area of intended German penetration and domination – German leadership position was to be the natural result of economic dominance.<ref name="essex.ac.uk"/> After the war, the Eastern part of Central Europe was placed at the centre of the concept. At that time the scientists took interest in the idea: the International Historical Congress in [[Brussels]] in 1923 was committed to Central Europe, and the 1933 Congress continued the discussions.
[[File:Little Entente.png|thumb|right|[[Little Entente]] defence union, ''The Versailles System and CE'', Oxford journals<ref name="ehr.oxfordjournals.org">{{cite journal|last1=Deak|first1=I. |title=The Versailles System and Central Europe|doi=10.1093/ehr/cej100 |page=338|volume=CXXI |year=2006 |journal=The English Historical Review|issue=490}}</ref>]]

Hungarian scholar Magda Adam wrote in her study ''Versailles System and Central Europe'' (2006): "Today we know that the bane of Central Europe was the [[Little Entente]], military alliance of Czechoslovakia, Romania and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), created in 1921 not for Central Europe's cooperation nor to fight German expansion, but in a wrong perceived notion that a completely powerless Hungary must be kept down".<ref name="ehr.oxfordjournals.org"/>

The avant-garde movements of Central Europe were an essential part of modernism’s evolution, reaching its peak throughout the continent during the 1920s. The ''Sourcebook of Central European avantgards'' (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) contains primary documents of the avant-gardes in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia from 1910 to 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=8958 |title=Between Worlds – The MIT Press |publisher=Mitpress.mit.edu |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> The manifestos and magazines of Western European radical art circles are well known to Western scholars and are being taught at primary universities of their kind in the western world.

=== Central Europe behind the Iron Curtain ===
Following [[World War II]], large parts of Europe that were culturally and historically Western became part of the [[Eastern bloc]]. Czech author [[Milan Kundera]] (emigrant to France) thus wrote in 1984 about the "Tragedy of Central Europe" in the [[New York Review of Books]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euroculture.upol.cz/dokumenty/sylaby/Kundera_Tragedy_(18).pdf|title=Kundera's article in pdf format}}</ref> Consequently, the English term ''Central Europe'' was increasingly applied only to the westernmost former Warsaw Pact countries (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary) to specify them as communist states that were culturally tied to Western Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11015/Regions-Regionalism-Eastern-Europe-Central-versus-Eastern-Europe.html|title=Central versus Eastern Europe}}</ref> This usage continued after the end of the Warsaw Pact when these countries started to undergo transition.

The post-World War II period brought blocking of the research on Central Europe in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, as its every result proved the dissimilarity of Central Europe, which was inconsistent with the [[Stalinist]] doctrine. On the other hand, the topic became popular in Western Europe and the United States, much of the research being carried out by immigrants from Central Europe.<ref>One of the main representatives was Oscar Halecki and his book ''The limits and divisions of European history'', London and New York 1950</ref> At the end of the communism, publicists and historians in Central Europe, especially anti-communist opposition, came back to their research.<ref>A. Podraza, Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny, 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004</ref>

According to ''Meyers Enzyklopädisches Lexikon'',<ref>Band 16, Bibliographisches Institut Mannheim/Wien/Zürich, Lexikon Verlag 1980</ref> Central Europe is a part of Europe composed by the surface of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, northern marginal regions of Italy and Yugoslavia (northern states- Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia) as well as northeastern France.

== Mitteleuropa, the German term ==
{{Importance-section|date=April 2012}}
[[File:Grossgliederung Europas-en.svg|thumb|right|German [[Mitteleuropa]] (by political and cultural criteria) covering [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], Germany, [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], the [[Baltic states]] and parts of [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], France and [[Italy]].]]
The German term ''[[Mitteleuropa]]'' (or alternatively its literal translation into English, ''Middle Europe''<ref name="Johnson, p. 165">Johnson, p. 165</ref>) is an ambiguous German concept.<ref name="Johnson, p. 165"/> It is sometimes used in English to refer to an area somewhat larger than most conceptions of 'Central Europe'; it refers to territories under German(ic)-Slavic [[cultural hegemony]] until World War I (encompassing Austria–Hungary and Germany in their pre-war formations but usually excluding the [[Baltic countries]] north of [[East Prussia]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} According to [[Fritz Fischer]] ''Mitteleuropa'' was a scheme in the era of the [[German Empire|Reich of 1871–1918]] by which the old imperial elites had allegedly sought to build a system of German economic, military and political domination from the northern seas to the Near East and from the Low Countries through the steppes of Russia to the Caucasus.<ref>Hayes, p. 16</ref> Later on, professor Fritz Epstein argued the threat of a Slavic "Drang nach Westen" (Western expansion) had been a major factor in the emergence of a ''Mitteleuropa'' ideology before the Reich of 1871 ever came into being.<ref>Hayes, p. 17</ref>

In Germany the connotation is also sometimes linked to the pre-war German provinces east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} which were lost as the result of World War II, annexed by [[People's Republic of Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and ethnically cleansed of Germans by communist authorities and forces (''see [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]]'') due to [[Yalta Conference]] and [[Potsdam Conference]] decisions. In this view [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], with its dual [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] heritage, combined with the historic element of the "[[Sudetenland]]", is a core region illustrating the problems and features of the entire Central European region.<br />
The term Mitteleuropa conjures up negative historical associations, although the Germans have not played an exclusively negative role in the region.<ref name="Johnson, p. 6">Johnson, p. 6</ref> Most Central European Jews embraced the enlightened German humanistic culture of the 19th century.<ref name="Johnson, p. 7">Johnson, p. 7</ref> German-speaking Jews from turn of the 20th century [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] became representatives of what many consider to be Central European culture at its best, though the Nazi version of "Mitteleuropa" destroyed this kind of culture.<ref name="Johnson, p. 7"/> Some German speakers are sensitive enough to the pejorative connotations of the term ''Mitteleuropa'' to use ''Zentraleuropa'' instead.<ref name="Johnson, p. 165"/> [[Adolf Hitler]] was obsessed by the idea of [[Lebensraum]] and many non-German Central Europeans identify ''Mitteleuropa'' with the instruments he employed to acquire it: war, deportations, genocide.<ref>Johnson, p. 170</ref>
