{{MLB playoffs sidebar}}
In [[Major League Baseball]], the '''National League Division Series''' ('''NLDS''') determines which two teams from the [[National League]] will advance to the [[National League Championship Series]]. The Division Series consists of two best-of-five series, featuring the three division winners and a [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] team.

==History==
The Division Series was implemented in 1981 as a result of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|midseason strike]] with first place teams before the strike taking on the first place teams after.  After 1993, it was implemented for good when Major League Baseball restructured each league into three divisions, but their next playing was in 1995 due to the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|cancellation of the 1994 playoffs]].  Previously, because of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] in [[1981 in baseball|1981]], a split-season format forced a divisional playoff series, in which the [[1981 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] won the Eastern Division series over the [[1981 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] three games to two while the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] beat the [[1981 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] three games to two in the Western Division. The team with the best overall record in the major leagues, the [[1981 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], failed to win their division in either half of that season and were controversially excluded, as were the [[1981 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], who finished with the NL's second-best record. The [[Atlanta Braves]] have currently played in the most NL division series with eleven appearances. The [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (whose finished with a losing record from 1993-2012) were the last team to make their first appearance in the NL division series, making their debut in 2013 after winning the [[2013 National League Wild Card Game]].

===Format===
From 1998 to 2011, the wild-card team was assigned to play the division winner with the best winning percentage (outside of their own division) in one series, and the other two division winners met in the other series. However, if the wild-card team and the division winner with the best record were from the same division, the wild-card team played the division winner with the second-best record, and the remaining two division leaders played each other. Beginning with the 2012 season, the wild card team that advances to the Division Series was to face the number 1 seed, regardless of whether or not they are in the same division. The two series winners move on to the best-of-seven NLCS. The winner of the wild card has won the first round 7 out of the 11 years since the re-alignment and creation of the NLDS. According to [[Nate Silver]], the advent of this playoff series, and especially of the wild card, has caused teams to focus more on "getting to the playoffs" rather than "winning the pennant" as the primary goal of the regular season.<ref>[[Nate Silver]], "Selig's Dream: The Wild Card as Enabler of Pennant Races," in Steven Goldman, Ed., ''It Ain't Over 'til It's Over'' (New York: Basic Books): 170-178.</ref>

Initially, the best-of-5 series played in a 2-3 format, with the first two games set at home for the lower seed team and the last three for the higher seed.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1984_NLCS.shtml 1984 NL Championship Series], Baseball-Reference.com</ref><ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1997_ALDS1.shtml 1997 AL Division Series], Baseball-Reference.com</ref> Since 1998, the series has followed a 2-2-1 format, <ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Gillette | editor-first = Gary | editor2-last = Palmer | editor2-first = Pete | encyclopedia = The 2006 ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia | title = October Classics: Postseason Series and Playoffs | page = 1656 | publisher = Sterling Publishing | year = 2006 | location = New York}}</ref> where the higher seed team plays at home in Games 1 and 2, the lower seed plays at home in Game 3 and Game 4 (if necessary), and if a Game 5 is needed, the teams return to the higher seed's field. When MLB added a second wild card team in 2012, the Division Series re-adopted the 2-3 format due to scheduling conflicts. It will revert to the 2-2-1 format from 2013 onwards.<ref name="SportingNews-2012WildCard">{{cite web
