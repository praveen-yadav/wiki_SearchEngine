'''Bishkek''' (in [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] and Russian: Бишкéк), formerly '''Pishpek''' and '''Frunze''', is the capital and the largest city of [[Kyrgyzstan]].
Bishkek is also the administrative centre of [[Chuy Province]] which surrounds the city, even though the city itself is not part of the province but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.

The name is thought to derive from a [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] word for a churn used to make fermented mare's milk ([[kumis]]), the Kyrgyz national drink. Founded in 1825 as a Khokand fortress of "Pishpek", on 4 September 1860 the fortress was seized by Russian forces led by colonel Zimmermann. In 1926 the city was given name ''Frunze'', after the [[Bolshevik]] military leader [[Mikhail Frunze]]. In 1991, the Kyrgyz parliament again changed the capital's name to Bishkek.

Bishkek is situated at about {{convert|800|m}} altitude just off the northern fringe of the [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too]] range, an extension of the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range, which rises up to {{convert|4855|m}} and provides a spectacular backdrop to the city. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighbouring [[Kazakhstan]]. The [[Chui River]] drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the [[Turkestan-Siberia Railway]] by a [[spur line]].

Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous [[Khrushchyovka|Soviet-style]] apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards and, especially outside the city centre, thousands of smaller privately built houses. It is laid out on a grid pattern, with most streets flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels that water the innumerable trees which provide shade in the hot summers.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Bishkek history}}

===Kokhand Rule===

Originally a caravan rest stop (possibly founded by the [[Sogdians]]) on one of the branches of the [[Silk Road]] through the [[Tian Shan]] range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] khan of [[Kokhand]] with a mud fort. In the last years of Kokhand rule the fortress was led by Atabek, the Datka.

===Tsarist Era===

In 1860, the fort was conquered and razed by the military forces of colonel Zimmermann when [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] annexed the area. Colonel [[Zimmermann|Zimmerman]] rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort and put field poruchik Titov as a head of new Russian [http://militera.lib.ru/h/pishpek/02.html garrison]. The site was redeveloped from 1877 onward by the Russian government, which encouraged the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile land to develop.

===Soviet Era===

In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast|Kirghiz ASSR]] and was renamed "Frunze" after [[Mikhail Frunze]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolutions of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917]] and during the [[Russian civil war]] of the early 1920s.

===Independence Era===

The early 1990s were tumultuous. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe ethnic riots in southern Kyrgyzstan which threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991 and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]]. Before independence, the majority of Bishkek's population was ethnic [[Russian people|Russians]]. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city's population, and about 7–8% in 2011.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3681/is_200407/ai_n9472919 Residential Real Estate Market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: Current Conditions and Prospects]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> {{dead link|date=August 2012}}

Today, Bishkek is a modern city, with many restaurants and cafes and with many second-hand European and Japanese cars and minibuses crowding its streets. Streets and sidewalks have fallen into disrepair since the 1990s. At the same time Bishkek still preserves its former Soviet feel, with Soviet-period buildings and gardens prevailing over newer structures.

Bishkek is also the country's financial centre, with all of the country's 21 commercial banks keeping headquarters in the city. During the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of industrial plants, but most have been shut down since 1991 or operate today on a much reduced scale. One of Bishkek's largest employment centres today is [[Dordoy Bazaar|Dordoy Bazaar open market]], which is one of the major sale place of Chinese goods imported to [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries.

==Geography==

===Orientation===
Though the city is relatively young, the surrounding area has some sites of interest dating from prehistory, the [[Greco-Buddhist]] period, the period of [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] influence, the era of the Central Asian ''[[khanate]]s'', and the Soviet period.

[[File:Bishkek historical museum.jpg|thumb|right|National Historical Museum]]

The central part of the city is primarily built on a rectangular grid plan. The city's main street is the east–west Chui Avenue ([[Chuy Prospekti]]), named after the region's [[Chui River|main river]]. In the Soviet era, it was called [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] Avenue. Along, or within a block or two from it, many of the most important government buildings, universities, the [[Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] compound, and so on, are to be found. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as [[Deng Xiaoping]] Avenue.

The main north–south axis is [[Yusup Abdrakhmanov]] Street, still commonly referred to by its old name, ''Sovietskaya Street''. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centres are located along it, and in the north it provides access to [[Dordoy Bazaar]].

Erkindik ("Freedom") Boulevard runs from north to south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chui Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chui Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard—named after a Communist revolutionary, [[Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky|Felix Dzerzhinsky]]—and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.

An important east–west street is Jibek Jolu ('[[Silk Road]]'). It runs parallel to Chui Avenue about a mile north of it, and is part of the main east–west road of [[Chui Province]]. Both the Eastern and Western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.

There is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). This is the only Catholic Cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.<ref>[http://www.catholic-kyrgyzstan.org/ Catholic Church in Kyrgyzstan]. Catholic-kyrgyzstan.org. Retrieved 11 March 2012.</ref>

===City centre===
[[File:Bishkek square.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ala-Too Square]], {{nowrap|Bishkek's main square}}]]
* State Historical Museum, located in [[Ala-Too Square]], the main city square
* State Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of Kyrgyz traditional [[handicraft]]s
* Frunze House Museum
* Statue of [[Ivan Panfilov]] stands in the park near the [[White House (Bishkek)|White House]].
* An [[equestrian statue]] of [[Mikhail Frunze]] still stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station.
* The train station itself was built in 1946 by German prisoners of war and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station.
* The main government building, the [[White House (Bishkek)|White House]], is a huge, seven story marble block and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz SSR]]
* At Ala-Too Square, there is an Independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched.
* [[Osh bazaar]], west of the downtown area, is a large, picturesque produce market

===Outer neighbourhoods===
The [[Dordoy Bazaar]], just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market.

===Outside the city===
The [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too]] mountain range, some {{convert|40|km}} away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the [[Ala Archa National Park]] is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away.

===Climate===
Bishkek has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfa/Dwa/Dsa: Hot (or very warm) summer subtype|Dsa]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Asia_Koppen_Map.png |title=Koppen Map |publisher=Upload.wikimedia.org |accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref> averaging 322 clear days annually due to its mountainous location. Average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is around {{convert|440|mm}} per year. Average daily temperatures range from {{convert|-3|°C|1}} in January to about {{convert|31|°C|1}} during July.<ref name = Pogoda /> The summer months are dominated by dry periods experiencing the occasional [[thunderstorm]] which produces strong gusty winds and rare [[dust storm]]s. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary to provide protection from much of the damaging weather along with the smaller chain which runs NW to SE. In the winter months, sparse [[Winter storm|snow storms]] and frequent heavy [[fog]] are the dominating features. When an inversion sets up, the fog can last for days at a time.

Responsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies on Kyrgyz State Agency on Hydrometeorology. In total, there are seven air quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and ammonia.<ref name="meteo.ktnet.kg"/>

==Economy==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:E7919-Dordoy-Bazaar-clothing.jpg|thumb|[[Dordoy Bazaar]]]]
Bishkek uses the Kyrgyzstan currency, the [[Kyrgyzstani som|som]]. The Som's value fluctuates regularly, but averages around 47 som per U.S. Dollar as of March 2011. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural with the mass amounts of fruits,  vegetables and livestock providing a co-existing system of bartering in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market style venue. In the major portions of downtown there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets and malls. The most sought after of the goods are the prevalent hand-crafted artisan pieces; these include statues, carvings, paintings and many nature based sculptures.

==Government==
Local government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor's Office.  [[Askarbek Salymbekov]] was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, following which his deputy [[Arstanbek Nogoev]] took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister [[Daniar Usenov]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=182916&Itemid=7|publisher=The Times of Central Asia|title=New mayor of Bishkek promises to solve capital’s problems|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024001610/http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=182916&Itemid=7 |archivedate = 24 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503|journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|volume=4|issue=190|last=Marat|first=Erica|title=Upcoming referendum sinks Kyrgyzstan deeper into crisis|date=15 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071022122621/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503 |archivedate = 22 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kyrgyz capital gets new mayor|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2005/05-08-22.rferl.html#20|publisher=Radio Free Europe|date=22 August 2005|accessdate=18 October 2007|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKgVssqi |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways [[Nariman Tuleyev]] was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010.

===Mass public transport===
There is public transportation available, including buses, electric [[trolley bus]]es, and public vans (known in Russian as ''[[marshrutka]]'').
Taxi cabs can be found throughout the city.

There is no subway in Bishkek, but the city is considering designing and building a light rail system ([[:ru:Бишкекское лёгкое метро|Бишкекское лёгкое метро]]).

===Commuter and long-distance buses===
There are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibuses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]], [[Tokmok]], [[Kemin]], [[Issyk Ata]], or the [[Korday]] border crossing.

Long-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to [[Almaty]] (the largest city in neighboring [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Kashgar]], China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller minority of them runs from the Eastern Station.

The Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibuses to suburban towns in all directions (from [[Sokuluk]] in the west to [[Tokmok|Tokmak]] in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia.

===Rail===
As of 2007, the Bishkek railway station sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.

There are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia ([[Novosibirsk]] and [[Novokuznetsk]]), via [[Almaty]], over the [[Turksib]] route, and to [[Yekaterinburg]] (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via [[Astana]]. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a {{convert|100|km}} before they enter the main [[Turksib]] line and can continue to the east or north). For example, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the [[Shu, Kazakhstan|Shu]] junction—a distance of some {{convert|269|km}} by rail, and less than half of that by road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poezda.net/ru/train_timetable?st_code=2708000&order=&forDate=3 |title=Маршрут поезда ????? - ????? на сайте |publisher=Poezda.net |date= |accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>

===Air===
The city is served by [[Manas International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code FRU), located approximately {{convert|25|km}} northwest of the city centre, and readily reachable by taxi.

In 2002, the United States obtained the right to use Manas International Airport as an [[Manas Air Base|air base]] for its military operations in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. Russia subsequently (2003) established an air base of its own ([[Kant (air base)|Kant Air Base]]) near [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]] some {{convert|20|km}} east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, [[Hosni Mubarak]], later became president of [[Egypt]].
